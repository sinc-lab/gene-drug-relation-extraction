summary
abstract

 xxxd2000xxx  is a potent and specific peripheral  xxxg487xxx 
(comt) inhibitor. it has been shown to improve the clinical benefits of levodopa
plus an  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor ( xxxg618xxx ) when given to
patients with parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose deterioration in the response
to levodopa (the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon). the efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  is currently being assessed in patients with stable parkinson’s disease.
in 2 well conducted trials of 6 months’ duration and smaller short term studies,
treatment with  xxxd2000xxx  (200mg with each dose of levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor)
was associated with significant increases in daily ‘on’ time and decreases in ‘off’
time. changes in unified parkinson’s disease rating scale (updrs) scores concurred with changes in ‘on’ and ‘off’ times:  xxxd2000xxx  improved total, activities
of daily living and motor function scores, but it had no effect on mentation scores.
 xxxd2000xxx  also provided benefits when given with controlled release levodopa/
 xxxg618xxx  inhibitor or with standard levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor and selegiline in
small trials.
dopaminergic events, including dyskinesia and nausea, are among the most
common events with  xxxd2000xxx , and are related to the drug’s ability to potentiate
the effects of levodopa. diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation and urine discolouration are the most common nondopaminergic events, although the latter
event is the only one to occur consistently more frequently with  xxxd2000xxx  than
with placebo. however, adverse events of any type infrequently led to study
discontinuation.
conclusions: the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2000xxx  administered with
levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor have not yet been compared with those of other strategies for the treatment of parkinson’s disease. however, once the decision to
initiate levodopa therapy has been made, studies generally support the use of
 xxxd2000xxx  as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with parkinson’s disease and the
‘wearing off’ phenomenon.

pharmacodynamic
properties

results of in vitro and ex vivo studies indicate that  xxxd2000xxx  is a potent, specific,
reversible and peripherally acting soluble  xxxg487xxx  (comt)
inhibitor. the drug has activity against comt at a number of peripheral sites,
but does not alter cerebral comt activity in vivo at doses used clinically.  xxxd2000xxx  does not affect other enzymes that metabolise catecholamines.
inhibition of comt activity reduces peripheral degradation of levodopa and
increases central levodopa, and therefore dopamine, concentrations. in positron

emission tomography studies using fluorodopa (an analogue of levodopa), single
doses of  xxxd2000xxx  have significantly increased unmetabolised fluorodopa fractions in both patients with parkinson’s disease and in healthy volunteers.
coadministration of  xxxd2000xxx  with levodopa plus an aromatic l-amino acid
decarboxylase inhibitor ( xxxg618xxx ) potentiates the effects of levodopa in patients
with parkinson’s disease and reduces the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon (see therapeutic efficacy and tolerability summaries). potentiation of the effects of levodopa by  xxxd2000xxx  has also been shown in animals.
therapeutic doses of  xxxd2000xxx  have only small effects on epinephrine
(adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) levels at rest or during exercise
in healthy volunteers or patients with parkinson’s disease; both catecholamines
are primarily metabolically inactivated by comt and monoamine oxidase
(mao). however, the pattern of metabolism of these agents is altered: plasma
3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid levels are increased
and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol levels are decreased. compared
with either monotherapy, when  xxxd2000xxx  and the mao-a inhibitor moclobemide are coadministered, similar or smaller changes in levels of the catecholamines
and their metabolites are observed.
few haemodynamic changes are reported after administration of  xxxd2000xxx 
to healthy volunteers or patients with parkinson’s disease.
pharmacokinetics

 xxxd2000xxx  is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of a single dose, and
mean maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of 1160 to 1500 mug/l are generally
reached 0.7 to 1.3 hours after administration of a 200mg dose in patients with
parkinson’s disease. importantly, no accumulation of plasma  xxxd2000xxx  was
detected in healthy male volunteers who received 8 daily doses of  xxxd2000xxx 
200mg for 5 days.
the elimination of  xxxd2000xxx  is mainly described by 2 phases; the beta-phase
represents approximately 90% of elimination and the gamma-phase about 10%. the
beta-phase elimination half-life (t1⁄2beta) of  xxxd2000xxx  after iv administration is 0.5 to
0.7 hours and the gamma-phase half-life (t1⁄2gamma) is 2.4 to 3.5 hours. additional data indicate that the t1⁄2 of oral  xxxd2000xxx  200mg is 1 to 2 hours, which is similar to the
t1⁄2 of levodopa (≈1.7 hours).
the mean oral bioavailability of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg was 36% in healthy volunteers.
the z-isomer of  xxxd2000xxx  is the main metabolite of  xxxd2000xxx  (itself the
e-isomer) in human plasma. the area under the plasma concentration-time curve
(auc) of the z-isomer is approximately 5% of the total auc of both isomers.
about 10% of an oral  xxxd2000xxx  dose is excreted into the urine within 8 hours.
 xxxd2000xxx  is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion in humans.
impairment of liver function (alcoholic cirrhosis) significantly increases the
bioavailability of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg. the pharmacokinetic parameters of single
doses of  xxxd2000xxx  are not affected in patients with renal failure or in the elderly.
single doses of  xxxd2000xxx  50 to 200mg and repeated  xxxd2000xxx  doses (for
7 days to 8 weeks) dose dependently increase the auc and elimination half-life
(t1⁄2) of levodopa when coadministered with levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor; no further
increases are seen with  xxxd2000xxx  400mg. however, cmax and time to reach cmax
(tmax) values for levodopa are generally unaffected by  xxxd2000xxx . eight weeks’
treatment with  xxxd2000xxx  increases mean levodopa concentrations, interdose
trough concentrations and interdose peak concentrations in patients with parkin-

son’s disease, but no accumulation of levodopa occurs. auc values of the levodopa metabolite 3-o-methyldopa are reduced by  xxxd2000xxx .
tmax and cmax values for levodopa were increased to a greater extent when
repeated doses of  xxxd2000xxx  (600 to 800 mg/day for 10 days) were given with
controlled release levodopa/carbidopa than when the drug was administered with
standard levodopa/carbidopa.
improved clinical effects of levodopa significantly and positively correlated
with increased auc values of plasma levodopa after coadministration with single
doses of  xxxd2000xxx  versus levodopa alone.
therapeutic efficacy

the efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with parkinson’s disease has been assessed
only in patients with an end-of-dose deterioration in the response to levodopa (the
‘wearing off’phenomenon) to date. the largest trials to have assessed the efficacy
of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with parkinson’s disease are 2 multicentre double-blind
randomised placebo-controlled 6-month studies, conducted in north america
(n = 205) and scandinavia (n = 171). in all trials,  xxxd2000xxx  200mg was administered with each dose of levodopa/carbidopa or levodopa/benserazide.
the duration of daily ‘on’ time improves by up to 2.1 hours when oral  xxxd2000xxx  is administered with standard levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor. in the large 6month trials,  xxxd2000xxx  improved the duration of daily ‘on’ time by 1 to 1.2
hours.  xxxd2000xxx  has shown efficacy after the first dose.
in 1 study,  xxxd2000xxx  had a significant treatment effect in patients who had
a low proportion of ‘on’ time at baseline (<55% of the awake day), but not in
those who spent ≥55% of their awake day ‘on’. the benefits of the drug were
noted to increase over the day.
patients’ daily ‘off’ time was reduced to a significantly greater extent in
 xxxd2000xxx  (1.3 hours) than in placebo (0.1 hours) recipients during treatment in
1 double-blind trial. changes in updrs scores concur with changes in ‘on’ and
‘off’ times, and  xxxd2000xxx  significantly improves total, activities of daily living
and motor function scores but it has no effect on mentation scores versus placebo
or baseline. investigators’ global assessments rated  xxxd2000xxx  superior to placebo in patients receiving levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor.
mean daily levodopa dosages were reduced from baseline by 11 to 16% in
recipients of  xxxd2000xxx  and levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor compared with in those
receiving levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor alone.
the beneficial effects of  xxxd2000xxx  are reversed rapidly after therapy withdrawal.
the benefits of  xxxd2000xxx  were also observed when the drug was administered with controlled release levodopa/carbidopa or with standard levodopa/
 xxxg618xxx  inhibitor plus selegiline in patients with parkinson’s disease, although
data are limited.

tolerability

dopaminergic adverse events, including dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucinations, vomiting and insomnia, occurred with  xxxd2000xxx  therapy in large clinical trials. these dopaminergic events probably occur because of increased
plasma and brain levodopa levels.
dyskinesia is among the most frequent adverse events in  xxxd2000xxx  recipients. dyskinesia occurs significantly more commonly with  xxxd2000xxx  than with
placebo and it almost always arises during the initial weeks of  xxxd2000xxx  treatment. the incidence of dyskinesia is reduced after reduction of levodopa dosages.
nausea is significantly more common in patients receiving  xxxd2000xxx  than

in those receiving placebo, however, it infrequently leads to treatment withdrawal.
urine discolouration, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and constipation are the most
common nondopaminergic adverse events to occur in  xxxd2000xxx  recipients, although urine discolouration is the only event to occur consistently more frequently with  xxxd2000xxx  than with placebo.
 xxxd2000xxx  generally causes no significant changes in haematological or biochemical parameters. phase iii studies assessed liver enzyme levels with  xxxd2000xxx  and no association between the drug and liver toxicity was shown: the
incidence of significant liver enzyme abnormalities (elevated  xxxg941xxx  or aspartate aminotransferase) was 0.8% in both  xxxd2000xxx  and placebo
recipients. data from larger patient numbers are required to confirm these findings, and such studies are ongoing.
similarly, there were no differences between  xxxd2000xxx  and placebo groups
in patients’ vital signs or ecg results in 2 large clinical trials.
overall, dyskinesia and diarrhoea appear to be the most common reasons for
stopping therapy in patients receiving  xxxd2000xxx  for 6 to 12 months. however,
the overall frequency of patient withdrawal from clinical trials because of adverse
events was low, and was similar in  xxxd2000xxx  and placebo recipients (5 to 7%).
drug interactions

in general,  xxxd2000xxx  did not alter the metabolism of exogenously administered
catecholamines nor, when administered with a mao inhibitor or imipramine, did
it potentiate cardiovascular changes.

dosage and
administration

 xxxd2000xxx  is indicated for the treatment of patients with parkinson’s disease and
the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon. it is recommended that a dose of 200mg is taken
with each daily dose of levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor. the maximum daily recommended dose of  xxxd2000xxx  is 2000 mg/day.

1. introduction
parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects about 1 to 2% of the
elderly population (aged >65 years).[1] it is often
diagnosed by the presence of 2 of the 3 cardinal
motor signs of parkinson’s disease which are tremor,
rigidity and akinesia/bradykinesia or by 3 of the 4
signs of tremor, rigidity, akinesia/bradykinesia and
postural instability.[2] although the progression of
parkinson’s disease is slow compared with other
degenerative parkinsonian disorders, the annual
rate of motor function decline is most rapid early
in the disease course (during the first 4 to 9 years).
this pattern of progression may be correlated
with the underlying nigral pathology. indeed, the
extent of neuronal loss is correlated with the severity of parkinson’s disease, although it is estimated
that a 70 to 90% reduction in striatal dopamine and
a 60 to 80% loss of substantia nigral neurons oc© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

curs before clinical symptoms of the disease are
seen.[1-4]
there are no definitive chemical markers for
parkinson’s disease and several parkinsonian conditions may be confused with the disease. however, a correct clinical diagnosis of parkinson’s disease is usually possible within 5 years of disease
onset.[2] older patients and those with akinetic-rigid
disease or concomitant dementia are more likely to
have rapid progression of the disease, whereas patients with tremor-dominant parkinson’s disease
have a slower disease progression than other patients.[3]
levodopa has had a dramatically positive effect
on the time to disease progression, but no treatment
has prevented continued deterioration. levodopa
is the most effective agent for treating patients with
parkinson’s disease and may increase life expectancy. however, levodopa is associated with a
number of adverse events which develop during

prolonged treatment. after treatment with the drug
for more than 5 or 6 years, ≥50% of patients develop response fluctuations, dyskinesia or dystonia.[1,3,5,6] although the mechanisms underlying
the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon are not well understood, fluctuations in plasma levels of levodopa are
thought to be involved.[6,7]
a reduction in the peripheral metabolism of
levodopa may help to stabilise plasma and therefore central levels of levodopa, thereby reducing or
preventing ‘wearing off’ effects.[6,8] levodopa is
predominantly metabolised by aromatic l-amino
acid decarboxylase ( xxxg618xxx ;  xxxg618xxx )
to dopamine and by  xxxg487xxx 
(comt) to 3-o-methyldopa. to prevent peripheral dopaminergic adverse events such as emesis,
orthostatic hypotension and cardiac arrhythmia,
and to allow a reduction in the required dosage,
levodopa is almost always administered with a
peripheral  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide). in the presence of carbidopa or benserazide,
o-methylation becomes the predominant form of
metabolism and very little levodopa reaches the
brain unchanged. as 3-o-methyldopa has a long
elimination half-life (t1⁄2) [about 15 hours], it can
accumulate during long term administration of
levodopa. this metabolite has sometimes been
associated with reduced efficacy of levodopa, the
‘wearing off’ phenomenon and dyskinesia,[9] although recent research has shown that the transport of levodopa to the brain is not affected by
3-o-methyldopa in clinically relevant concentrations. inhibition of comt reduces the degradation
of levodopa to 3-o-methyldopa. adverse events are
not likely with comt inhibitors despite the wide
distribution of comt in humans, because the
metabolic capacity of the enzyme in the periphery
is high, allowing only minor comt inhibition to
be achieved.[9]
coadministration of a comt inhibitor with
levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor combinations has the
potential benefit of increasing the availability of
levodopa to the brain and, therefore, reducing the
dose and frequency of administration of levodopa
without an increase in response fluctuations.[9]

this review focuses on the pharmacology and
therapeutic efficacy of the reversible and specific
‘second generation’ comt inhibitor  xxxd2000xxx .
as seen in figure 1,  xxxd2000xxx  has a nitrocatechol
structure.
2. pharmacodynamic properties
table i summarises the pharmacodynamic properties of  xxxd2000xxx .
2.1 mechanism of action
2.1.1 effects on peripheral comt

results of in vitro and ex vivo studies indicate
that  xxxd2000xxx  is a potent, specific, reversible and
peripherally acting soluble comt inhibitor.[10] it
is also tight-binding with an association constant
of 14 nmol/l. drug concentrations producing 50%
inhibition (ic50) of comt activity in rat duodenum, erythrocytes and liver were 10, 20 and 160
nmol/l, indicating that the drug has activity at a
number of peripheral sites. these values are in
the same range as those for nitecapone and  xxxd3395xxx .[8] in contrast, ic50 values for other enzymes
that metabolise catecholamines [ xxxg2276xxx , dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, monoamine oxidase
(mao)-a and -b and phenolsulphotransferase-m
and -p] were >50 mumol/l.[10]
in tissue samples from humans,  xxxd2000xxx 
had the greatest effect on duodenal comt and was
a more potent comt inhibitor than  xxxd3395xxx  in
liver, duodenal, lung and kidney tissue.[11] similarly, ex vivo studies in rat tissue indicated that the
inhibitory effect of  xxxd2000xxx  on comt was of

the longest duration and greatest magnitude in the
duodenum.[10]
in 6 healthy volunteers, single doses of oral
 xxxd2000xxx  5 to 800mg dose-dependently inhibited soluble comt in red blood cells: maximal
inhibition ranged from 17% with a 5mg dose to
82% after  xxxd2000xxx  800mg. inhibition of comt
was maximal within 1 hour of administration and
had returned to baseline levels within 8 hours.[12]
2.1.2 effects on central comt

 xxxd2000xxx  did not alter cerebral comt activity in rats.[10] nevertheless, peripheral inhibition
of comt increased concentrations of circulating
levodopa, resulting in increased central levodopa,
and therefore dopamine, concentrations in rats
also given levodopa plus carbidopa. when given
with these latter agents, oral  xxxd2000xxx  0.3 to 30
mg/kg dose-dependently increased striatal levodopa utilisation when compared with utilisation in
rats given only levodopa and carbidopa.[10] peripheral inhibition of comt by  xxxd2000xxx  reduces
3-o-methyldopa concentrations in the serum, which
is reflected as lower striatal 3-o-methyldopa concentrations compared with values after levodopa
plus carbidopa only.[10]
studies using radiolabelled fluorodopa (an analogue of levodopa) and positron emission tomography have confirmed that, by decreasing peripheral
o-methylation of fluorodopa, single  xxxd2000xxx 
doses significantly increase plasma concentrations
of the unmetabolised catecholamine and striatal
fluorodopa uptake in patients with parkinson’s disease and in healthy volunteers. in general, individuals (n = 4 to 15 patients or healthy volunteers)
received a single dose of  xxxd2000xxx  200, 400 or
800mg 60 minutes before injection of fluorodopa

and were also given carbidopa to prevent peripheral
decarboxylation of fluorodopa.[13-15]
in a placebo-controlled study,  xxxd2000xxx  400
or 800mg increased the unmetabolised fluorodopa
fraction in arterial plasma from 22 to 56% in both
patients with parkinson’s disease and healthy volunteers (p < 0.0001). [13] central penetration of
unmetabolised fluorodopa into the brain increased
by 38% (p < 0.0001). the magnitude of changes
in plasma did not differ significantly with  xxxd2000xxx  dose or participant type.[13] in another trial,
the increase in arterial plasma fluorodopa with  xxxd2000xxx  200 to 800mg was dose-dependent, and
the difference between the 200 and 800mg dose of
 xxxd2000xxx  was significant (p = 0.006).[14] central
accumulation of fluorodopa with  xxxd2000xxx  was
significantly greater in patients with milder parkinson’s disease than in those with more severe disease after ‘early’ imaging (data were collected for
90 minutes after fluorodopa injection; no p value
provided).[24] however, central accumulation of
fluorodopa was increased in a patient with parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose fluctuations after
‘late’ imaging (3 to 3.5 hours after fluorodopa injection) in a study that was briefly reported.[25]
2.2 potentiation of the effects of levodopa

the predominant action of comt inhibitors,
including  xxxd2000xxx , is to reduce peripheral degradation of levodopa (discussed in section 3.2) and
therefore potentiate and prolong the effects of
levodopa. sections 4 and 5 evaluate clinical trials
conducted in patients with parkinson’s disease and
the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon that confirm that,
when administered as single 200mg doses with each
levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor dose,  xxxd2000xxx  potentiates the effects of levodopa.
in mptp-treated marmosets (a primate model
of parkinson’s disease), pretreatment with a single
dose of oral  xxxd2000xxx  12.5 mg/kg enhanced the
intensity and duration of effects (improved locomotor activity and reduced motor dysfunction) produced by a threshold dose of levodopa (2.5 mg/kg)
plus carbidopa (p < 0.05).[16] the effects of  xxxd2000xxx  5 to 25 mg/kg were dose related: interestdrugs 1999 jul; 58 (1)

166

ingly, doses greater than 12.5 mg/kg were less effective than lower doses.  xxxd2000xxx  12.5 mg/kg
did not alter the response to a near-maximal dose
of levodopa (12.5 mg/kg) plus carbidopa.
when the effects of  xxxd2000xxx  and carbidopa,
alone and combined, on the efficacy of levodopa
were compared in marmosets,  xxxd2000xxx  alone
produced the smallest enhancement and  xxxd2000xxx  plus carbidopa the greatest.[16] similarly,  xxxd2000xxx  plus benserazide had greater effects than
either agent alone in rats with unilateral lesions of
the substantia nigra.[17]
in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) unilaterally
brain-lesioned rats, coadministration of  xxxd2000xxx  with levodopa and carbidopa had a greater
effect than coadministration of selegiline with
these latter agents. however, a combination of all
4 drugs had the greatest effect on rat behaviour, and
this strategy has been investigated in a few patients
with parkinson’s disease (section 4.2).[26]
2.3 effects on catecholamine metabolism

as epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine
(noradrenaline) are primarily metabolically inactivated by comt and mao, inhibition of either or
both of these enzymes could lead to increases in
levels of these catecholamines.
compared with no treatment, a single dose of
 xxxd2000xxx  200mg did not significantly alter plasma
epinephrine or norepinephrine levels at rest or during exercise in 12 healthy volunteers (exerciseinduced increases in catecholamine levels were
maintained and not potentiated).[21] similarly, few
changes in levels of these catecholamines versus
no treatment were detected after single and repeated doses of  xxxd2000xxx  400 and 800mg in 8 to
11 healthy volunteers: the only significant changes
after either dose were decreases in resting epinephrine and norepinephrine levels after  xxxd2000xxx 
400mg 3 times daily (p < 0.05).[22]
however, the pattern of metabolism of these
agents was altered at rest and during exercise, as
plasma 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol ( xxxd2178xxx ) and
3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac) levels
were increased and plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

holm & spencer

phenylglycol (mhpg) levels were decreased (p <
0.05 vs no treatment for all).[21,22] changes in
 xxxd2178xxx  and dopac levels were likely a result of
increased metabolism via the mao pathway. compared with either monotherapy, when  xxxd2000xxx 
and the mao-a inhibitor moclobemide were coadministered, similar or smaller changes in levels of
the catecholamines and their metabolites were observed.[27]
 xxxd2000xxx  200mg with each dose of levodopa
for 7 days caused no significant changes versus
placebo in plasma norepinephrine levels or autonomic function in 15 patients with parkinson’s disease enrolled in a double-blind randomised crossover trial that was briefly reported.[20]
2.4 cardiac effects

it is possible that inhibition of comt may increase catecholamine levels leading to enhanced
adrenergic stimulation, although few changes have
been observed with  xxxd2000xxx  (section 2.3). nevertheless, cardiovascular changes may result from
administration of a comt inhibitor. indeed,  xxxd3395xxx  increased mitochondrial and cellular respiration and caused symptoms indicative of uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in rats[23] and
caused impairment of cardiac function (left ventricular systolic and end diastolic pressure) in isolated guinea-pig heart.[18] in contrast,  xxxd2000xxx 
either had no such effect[23] or was 20 to 30 times
less potent than  xxxd3395xxx ,[18] respectively.
in 8 patients with parkinson’s disease (aged 45
to 70 years), monitoring of blood pressure and
beat-to-beat (r-r interval) variation during the
deep breathing, valsalva, tilt-table and hand grip
tests revealed no significant differences between
treatment with levodopa plus carbidopa with versus without  xxxd2000xxx .[19] patients received levodopa/carbidopa 100/25mg alone and with a single
oral dose of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg in a nonblinded
randomised crossover manner. a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled crossover study, reported as an abstract, confirms a lack of significant
haemodynamic effects with  xxxd2000xxx  in 15 patients with parkinson’s disease who received a

 xxxd2000xxx : a review

200mg dose of the drug with each dose of levodopa
for 1 week.[20]
 xxxd2000xxx  200mg alone, as a single dose, also
had no significant haemodynamic effects at rest or
during exercise testing in 12 healthy volunteers:
heart rate and blood pressure were unchanged compared with control values.[21] similarly, no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate from
baseline were detected after 7 days of  xxxd2000xxx 
400 or 800mg 3 times daily in a study conducted
in 11 healthy volunteers.[22] however, mean systolic blood pressure was significantly increased from
baseline after a single 400mg dose and 1 patient
developed ventricular extrasystoles during exercise after a single 800mg dose. these extrasystoles
were unifocal, isolated and spontaneously resolved
but did result in patient withdrawal from the study.
 xxxd2000xxx  400mg as a single dose potentiated
the effect of  xxxd2398xxx  ( xxxd2401xxx ) infusion
on heart rate (maximal increase of 40 vs 27 beats/
min; p < 0.05), but did not alter the latter drug’s
effect on blood pressure nor its plasma concentration in healthy volunteers. epinephrine-induced
haemodynamic responses were unaffected by this
dose of  xxxd2000xxx .[28]
3. pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetic parameters of  xxxd2000xxx 
have been studied in patients with parkinson’s disease and in healthy volunteers with and without
liver or renal failure. participants were usually receiving levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor also.
3.1 general profile of  xxxd2000xxx 

 xxxd2000xxx  is rapidly absorbed after oral administration of a single dose. mean maximum plasma concentrations (cmax) of 1160 to 1500 mug/l are
generally reached 0.7 to 1.3 hours after administration of 200mg doses (the most commonly used
dose in clinical trials; section 4) in patients with
parkinson’s disease.[19,29,30] area under the plasma
concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 or 6 hours
(auc4-6) values are about 1500 mug/l • h in patients
with parkinson’s disease after a single 200mg
dose.[19,30] cmax, time to reach cmax (tmax) and auc

values for  xxxd2000xxx  generally increased linearly
over the dose range 5 to 800mg in healthy volunteers[12] and patients with parkinson’s disease.[29]
the elimination of  xxxd2000xxx  is mainly described by 2 phases; the beta-phase represents approximately 90% of elimination and the gamma-phase about
10%.[31] the beta-phase elimination half-life (t1⁄2beta)
of  xxxd2000xxx  after iv administration is 0.5 to 0.7
hours and the gamma-phase half-life (t1⁄2gamma) is 2.4 to 3.5
hours.[31] additional data indicate that the t1⁄2 of
oral  xxxd2000xxx  200mg is 1 to 2 hours,[31] which is
similar to the t1⁄2 of levodopa (≈1.7 hours).[32]
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2000xxx  were
generally unaffected by multiple dose administration,[30] apart from a significant increase in the
auc after daily dosages of 200mg 4 to 6 times
daily for 4 weeks versus the value after a single
200mg dose (1690 vs 1450 mug/l • h, p < 0.05) in
patients with parkinson’s disease.[30] furthermore,
no accumulation of  xxxd2000xxx  in plasma was detected in healthy male volunteers who received 8
daily doses of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg for 5 days.[33]
the mean oral bioavailability of  xxxd2000xxx 
200mg was 36% in healthy volunteers.[12]
the z-isomer of  xxxd2000xxx  is the main metabolite of  xxxd2000xxx  (itself the e-isomer) in human
plasma.[34] the auc of the z-isomer is approximately 5% of the total auc of both isomers.[12]
about 10% of an oral  xxxd2000xxx  dose is excreted
into the urine within 8 hours; the glucuronides of
the unchanged drug (70%) and the z-isomer (25%)
were the most abundant metabolites.[34]  xxxd2000xxx  is primarily eliminated via biliary excretion
in humans.[31]
3.1.1 effects of hepatic or renal
impairment and age

the bioavailability of  xxxd2000xxx  was approximately twice as high in patients with impaired liver
function (alcoholic cirrhosis) as in healthy controls
after a single oral 200mg dose (p < 0.01).[35] consequently, it has been suggested that the dosage of
 xxxd2000xxx  be reduced in patients with hepatic
impairment.[35]
the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of  xxxd2000xxx  are not significantly altered in the elderly

holm & spencer

(aged 64 to 76 years) or in patients with moderate
or severe renal impairment compared with younger
patients and healthy controls, respectively.[31] it appears that dialysis patients may require a longer
dosing interval of  xxxd2000xxx .[31]
3.2 effects of  xxxd2000xxx  on the
pharmacokinetics of levodopa

table ii illustrates the effects of single doses of
 xxxd2000xxx  on the pharmacokinetics of standard
levodopa plus  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor from a study in patients with parkinson’s disease.
 xxxd2000xxx  significantly increased the auc
and t1⁄2 of levodopa versus control groups in both
patients[19,29,30,36-38] and young healthy male volunteers[39,40] when coadministered with levodopa/
 xxxg618xxx  inhibitor in most studies that reported these
parameters (p < 0.05). there were generally no significant changes in levodopa cmax or tmax with  xxxd2000xxx .[19,29,30,37-41]
a single 200mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  was associated with optimal pharmacokinetic effects on levodopa in a dose-response study (including 50, 100,
200 and 400mg doses) in patients with parkinson’s
disease and the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon.[29] a
200mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  was associated with
maximal and significant (p < 0.001) increases in
auc4 and t1⁄2 of levodopa versus placebo; no further increases were seen with  xxxd2000xxx  400mg.[29]
repeated doses of  xxxd2000xxx  for 8 weeks increased mean levodopa concentrations (despite a
reduction in mean levodopa dose), interdose trough
concentrations and interdose peak concentrations

in patients with parkinson’s disease.[36] therefore,
 xxxd2000xxx  is likely to prolong the time that levodopa levels are above the therapeutic plasma level.
no accumulation of levodopa was apparent from
one day to the next.[36]
auc values of the levodopa metabolite 3-omethyldopa were reduced with single[29,39,40] or repeated[30,36,37] doses of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with
parkinson’s disease[29,30,36,37] or young healthy
volunteers.[39,40]
the addition of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg to controlled
release levodopa/carbidopa significantly increased
the auc of levodopa versus the controlled release
preparation alone in patients with parkinson’s disease[42] or in healthy volunteers.[32]  xxxd2000xxx  did
not increase other pharmacokinetic variables (cmax,
tmax or t1⁄2) when administered as a single 200mg
dose.[32,42] repeated doses of  xxxd2000xxx  (600 to
800 mg/day for 10 days) increased the auc of controlled release and standard levodopa/carbidopa to
a similar extent (36 vs 33%).[43] however, tmax was
prolonged to a greater extent over levodopa alone
when  xxxd2000xxx  was given with controlled release
levodopa/carbidopa (60 minutes) than when the drug
was given with standard levodopa/carbidopa (30
minutes). furthermore, the cmax of levodopa was
slightly reduced when  xxxd2000xxx  was administered with standard levodopa/carbidopa, but significantly increased when  xxxd2000xxx  given with controlled release levodopa/carbidopa.[43]
a population pharmacodynamic model of the
dose response study discussed above,[29] which accounted for interindividual and interoccasion variability, showed that the concentration-effect curve
of levodopa was not affected by  xxxd2000xxx , suggesting that  xxxd2000xxx  acts at the peripheral level
only.[44]
3.2.1 correlation of levodopa pharmacokinetics
with clinical effects

after a single 200mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx , the
mean change in ‘on’ time significantly and positively correlated with the mean increase in the auc
of levodopa in a study reported as an abstract in
patients with parkinson’s disease and the ‘wearing
off’ phenomenon (r = 0.5, p < 0.05).[45]
drugs 1999 jul; 58 (1)

 xxxd2000xxx : a review

furthermore, a mean increase in the auc of the
motor unified parkinson’s disease rating scale
(updrs) scores with a single 200mg dose of  xxxd2000xxx  significantly and positively correlated
with a mean increase in the auc for plasma levodopa in patients with parkinson’s disease (r = 0.5;
p = 0.04).[45]
4. therapeutic efficacy
all published studies that have assessed the efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with parkinson’s
disease have been conducted in patients with an
end-of-dose deterioration in the response to levodopa (the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon).
two multicentre double-blind randomised
placebo-controlled studies, conducted in north
america (n = 205) [46] and scandinavia (n =
171),[47] are the largest trials to have assessed the
efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with parkinson’s
disease. most of the efficacy data discussed below
relates to these studies.  xxxd2000xxx  was administered for 6 months with standard (not controlled
release) preparations of levodopa/carbidopa or
levodopa/benserazide in the scandinavian study,[47]
and levodopa/carbidopa in the north american
study.[46] patients’ mean age was 63 years and
symptoms of parkinson’s disease had been present
for a mean of 11 years (study entry hoehn and yahr
stage 1.5 to 4.0). continuation of pre-existing antiparkinsonian therapy (i.e. amantadine, selegiline,
anticholinergics or dopamine receptor agonists)
was allowed.
the primary efficacy variables in the trials were
the duration of daily ‘on’ time (mobile or able to
move with relative independence)[47] or the proportion of awake time spent ‘on’,[46] as determined
from patients’ diaries. secondary efficacy parameters included the daily ‘off’ time (immobile or
unable to move with ease),[47] the total daily levodopa dosage,[46] patients’ and investigators global
evaluations and updrs scores.[46,47] the levodopa dosage could be adjusted up or down in both
the north american and scandinavian studies, depending on clinical response, for the first 8 weeks
of therapy. intention-to-treat analyses were per© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

formed using the last observation carried forward
method.[46,47]
a number of smaller studies (n = 9 to 23) have
assessed the efficacy of 7 days’ to 2 months’  xxxd2000xxx  treatment with an  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor and
standard levodopa preparations,[29,30,37,38,48,49] controlled release levodopa[42,43] or levodopa combined with selegiline[50] in patients with parkinson’s disease.
in all studies,  xxxd2000xxx  200mg was taken with
each dose of levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor. levodopa
preparations were generally taken 3 or 4 times
daily, although the range in all studies was 3 to 10
doses per day.  xxxd2000xxx  200mg has been shown
to be the most effective dose for administration
with levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor on the basis of
pharmacokinetic and clinical data in patients with
parkinson’s disease who were experiencing ‘wearing off’ phenomenon (section 3.2).[29]
4.1 changes in ‘on’ and ‘off’ time

large well controlled[46,47] and smaller doubleblind or nonblinded[30,37] studies have shown that
oral  xxxd2000xxx  generally improves the duration of
daily ‘on’ time by 30 to 60 minutes versus placebo
or baseline when the drug is administered with
levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor for 1 to 6 months. a
mean improvement in daily ‘on’ time of up to 2.1
hours versus placebo was achieved in 23 patients
with 1 months’  xxxd2000xxx  therapy.[37]  xxxd2000xxx 
has shown to be effective after the first dose.[29,48]
in both the scandinavian[47] and north american [46] studies described above,  xxxd2000xxx  was
associated with significantly greater improvements in daily ‘on’ time than placebo at weeks 8,
16 and 24 (p < 0.005), as shown in figures 2 and 3.
at week 24, mean daily ‘on’ time was increased in
 xxxd2000xxx  recipients by 1.2[47] or 1[46] hour versus
placebo. in 1 study,[46]  xxxd2000xxx  had a significant
treatment effect (‘on’ time increased by 10.3%) in
patients who had a low proportion of ‘on’ time at
baseline (<55% of the awake day), but not in those
who spent ≥55% of their awake day ‘on’. the benefits of the drug were noted to increase over the
day, becoming significant in the afternoon and

given with each dose of levodopa/carbidopa or levodopa/
benserazide (4 to 10 times daily) in this multicentre double-blind
randomised trial.  xxxd2000xxx  therapy had been withdrawn for

placebo, † p < 0.001 vs week 24.

peaking in the evening. patients’ daily ‘off’ time
was assessed in the scandinavian study[47] and was
found to be reduced to a significantly greater extent
in  xxxd2000xxx  (1.3 hours) than placebo (0.1 hours)
recipients during treatment (p < 0.001).
the beneficial effects of  xxxd2000xxx  are reversed rapidly after therapy withdrawal: 2 weeks
after the withdrawal of  xxxd2000xxx , daily ‘on’ time
significantly decreased (fig. 2) and ‘off’ time increased to values similar to those at baseline in the
scandinavian study. [47] similarly, the percentage
of awake time spent ‘on’ rapidly decreased (by an
average of 7.3%; p = 0.003) over the first 2 days
after  xxxd2000xxx  withdrawal in the north american
study.[46]
 xxxd2000xxx  also increased the duration of daily
‘on’ time from baseline when the drug was administered with controlled release levodopa/carbidopa
in patients with parkinson’s disease.[42,43] in a non© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

changes in updrs scores concurred with
changes in ‘on’ and ‘off’ times, and there were significant improvements in scores when  xxxd2000xxx 
was administered with levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor
versus placebo or baseline.[38,43,46,47,50]
in the north american and scandinavian trials,
total updrs scores during patients’ ‘on’ time were
significantly (p < 0.05) better with  xxxd2000xxx  than
with placebo at week 24.[46,47] the effect of  xxxd2000xxx  on updrs scores in the scandinavian

change in updrs subscales and total score from baseline

favour of  xxxd2000xxx  versus placebo were observed for the updrs subscales ii (activities of
daily living) and iii (motor function) at week 24 in
both studies (all p < 0.05).[46,47]  xxxd2000xxx  had no
effect on scores for the updrs subscale i (behaviour, mentation and mood) in either study.[46,47]
updrs scores worsened rapidly after the withdrawal of  xxxd2000xxx , as was the case with ‘on’
times.[46,47]
quantitative assessment, using computerised
technology, of the motor response to levodopa after
4 weeks’  xxxd2000xxx  administration corresponded
with results using the motor part of the updrs in
a double-blind crossover study (reported as an
abstract) in 12 patients with parkinson’s disease.
the duration of motor response increased by 45
minutes versus placebo when the parameter was
assessed quantitatively (p < 0.001) and by 30 minutes when the motor part of the updrs was used
(p value not documented).[49]
 xxxd2000xxx  significantly improved modified
updrs iii (motor function) scores to a similar extent from baseline in nonblinded studies when the
drug was administered for 10 days with controlled
release levodopa/carbidopa or standard levodopa/
carbidopa in 12 patients (p < 0.001)[43] or for 7 days
with standard levodopa/benserazide in 9 patients.[38]
the effects of adding selegiline 10 mg/day to
therapy with  xxxd2000xxx  and levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor for 14 days were assessed in a double-blind
placebo-controlled crossover study in 12 patients
with parkinson’s disease.[50] (selegiline inhibits
the central metabolism of dopamine and prolongs
the duration of response to levodopa.[51]) mean
values of the modified updrs iii subscale scores
were significantly more improved from baseline
when  xxxd2000xxx  was administered with both
levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor and selegiline than
when  xxxd2000xxx  plus placebo was given with
levodopa preparations (p < 0.01). however, the
best response to treatment (mean of the lowest
daily motor scores) did not differ appreciably between groups: the motor score was 21.4 at baseline
and improved to 17.4 after  xxxd2000xxx /selegiline

in the 6-month north american study,[46] investigators’ global assessments of patients became
more positive over time in the  xxxd2000xxx  group
and more negative over time in the placebo group.
at week 24, between-group differences were statistically significant (p = 0.002).[46] investigators’

icantly in favour of  xxxd2000xxx  in the 6-month
scandinavian study,[47] and patients’ global assessments were more favourable with  xxxd2000xxx  than
with placebo in both 6-month studies.[46,47]
the mean daily levodopa dosage was reduced
from baseline by 11 to 16% in studies of 1 months’
duration[30,37] and by 12% in the scandinavian
study of 6 months’ duration.[47] in the 6-month
north american study, the mean daily dosage of
levodopa was 12% lower with  xxxd2000xxx  than with
placebo.[46] the difference in levodopa dosages
between  xxxd2000xxx  and placebo recipients was
approximately 100mg in both 6-month studies (p <
0.01).[46,47] the levodopa dosage was often reduced in studies because of dyskinesia (section 5).
the starting time of the motor response (onset
latency) and the time to reach the lowest score
during the levodopa test (peak latency) were generally not affected when repeated doses of  xxxd2000xxx  were administered with standard levodopa/
carbidopa or benserazide[30,37] or controlled release
levodopa/carbidopa.[42,43]
5. tolerability
most of the tolerability data discussed below are
from the 2 large well conducted studies in patients
with parkinson’s disease and the ‘wearing off’
phenomenon that were conducted in north america (n = 205) and scandinavia (n = 171) and were
discussed in detail in section 4.[46,47] patients received  xxxd2000xxx  concomitantly with each dose
of levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor to a total dose of 800
to 2000 mg/day in these studies. overall, dyskinesia and diarrhoea appear to be the most common
reasons for study withdrawal in patients receiving
 xxxd2000xxx  for 6 to 12 months.[46,47,52] however,
the overall frequency of patient withdrawal because of adverse events was low and was similar in
 xxxd2000xxx  and placebo recipients (5 to 7%).[46,47]
adverse events with  xxxd2000xxx  for 10 days to 1
month were reported to be transient and mild to
moderate in intensity in small double-blind randomised or nonblinded studies in 12 to 23 patients
with parkinson’s disease and the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon.[30,37,43,50]

5.1 dopaminergic adverse events

dopaminergic adverse events, including dyskinesia, nausea, dizziness, hallucinations, vomiting
and insomnia, were reported during  xxxd2000xxx 
therapy in the north american and scandinavian
trials.[46,47] the increase in dopaminergic events
probably occurs because of increased plasma and
brain levodopa levels.
dopaminergic adverse events were significantly
more common with  xxxd2000xxx  (n = 4/218) than
with placebo (n = 0/108) [24% of patients vs 8%,
p < 0.01] in a large 12-month randomised doubleblind trial, reported as an abstract, that specifically
assessed the tolerability of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients
with either the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon or stable
disease.[52] dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, dizziness
and insomnia were also reported in one or more
small double-blind randomised or nonblinded studies (10 days’ to 1 months’ duration), although no
significant differences between  xxxd2000xxx  and
placebo were detected.[30,37,43,50]
5.1.1 dyskinesia

dyskinesia was among the most frequent adverse events in  xxxd2000xxx  recipients in the large
north american and scandinavian studies, and was
significantly more common with  xxxd2000xxx  than
with placebo (p < 0.01).[46,47] 53% of  xxxd2000xxx 
recipients and 32% of placebo recipients participating in the north american trial experienced
dyskinesia,[46] and 8.2 and 1.2% of entacaponeand placebo-treated patients, respectively, experienced worsening of dyskinesia in the scandinavian
study.[47]
the overall incidence of dyskinesia at end-point
was reduced to baseline levels after reduction of
levodopa dosages over 24 weeks in 1 trial[47] and
dyskinesia was resolved in one-third of  xxxd2000xxx 
recipients after 8 weeks of dosage adjustment in the
other trial.[46] dyskinesia almost always arose during the first 8 weeks of  xxxd2000xxx  treatment in 1
study.[46]  xxxd2000xxx  significantly increased the
mean duration, but not the magnitude, of dyskinesia in double-blind randomised trials in patients
with parkinson’s disease. this effect is in accord

 xxxd2000xxx : a review

with more sustained plasma levels of levodopa and
unchanged cmax or tmax values of levodopa with
 xxxd2000xxx  administration (section 3.2).[29,37]
the duration of dyskinesia was significantly
and positively correlated with the change in daily
‘on’ time achieved after a single 200mg dose of
 xxxd2000xxx  in a study reported as an abstract in
patients with parkinson’s disease and the ‘wearing
off’ phenomenon (r = 0.5, p < 0.05).[45]
5.1.2 other dopaminergic adverse events

nausea was significantly more common in patients receiving  xxxd2000xxx  than in those receiving
placebo in both the north american[46] (16 vs 5%,
p = 0.01) and scandinavian[47] (20 vs 8.1%, p <
0.05) studies. however, nausea resulted in the
withdrawal of only 1  xxxd2000xxx  recipient from
one of these trials.[47]  xxxd2000xxx  patients in the
12-month tolerability study experienced nausea only
slightly more often than placebo recipients.[52]
dizziness, hallucinations and vomiting were
experienced by 5 to 24% of  xxxd2000xxx  recipients
and up to 14% of placebo patients in the north
american trial, but only the difference in the incidence of vomiting was significant between groups
(p < 0.05).[46] insomnia was experienced by similar
proportions of  xxxd2000xxx  and placebo patients
(≈8%) in the scandinavian trial.[47]
the incidence of orthostatic hypotension, a dopaminergic adverse event, is not significantly different between  xxxd2000xxx  and placebo recipients.
however, 16% of patients receiving  xxxd2000xxx 
and 10% of placebo recipients in the north american study reported experiencing falls, although
these were not confirmed to be a result of orthostatic hypotension.[46] orthostatic hypotension was
also reported in 3 and worsened in 1 entacaponetreated patients with advanced parkinson’s disease
(hoehn and yahr stage 2 to 4) in a 1-month nonblinded trial (n = 12).[30]
5.2 nondopaminergic adverse events

diarrhoea, abdominal pain, urine discolouration and constipation were reported by  xxxd2000xxx 
recipients from the north american and scandinavian studies.[46,47] the difference in the frequency

of events was significant versus placebo for urine
discolouration (11 to 37% vs 0 to 1.2%) in both
studies[46,47] and diarrhoea (20 vs 7%)[47] and constipation (14 vs 5%)[46] in 1 study each (all p <
0.05).
in common with  xxxd3395xxx , discolouration of
urine to a yellow/orange colour is ascribed to the
colour of the drug and its metabolite and is considered to be benign.[53]
in general, diarrhoea and abdominal pain were
also the most common adverse events in small
nonblinded and double-blind randomised studies
of <1 months’ duration.[30,37,38,43,50] diarrhoea was
significantly more common with  xxxd2000xxx  (8%)
than with placebo (1%) [p < 0.01], resulting in 4
versus 0 study withdrawals, respectively, in the
preliminary report of a tolerability study in 326
patients with end-of-dose deterioration or stable disease. between-group differences for other nondopaminergic adverse events were not documented.[52]
5.3 effects on laboratory parameters

no significant changes in haematological or
biochemical parameters were reported in patients
with parkinson’s disease and the ‘wearing off’
phenomenon in the clinical studies of up to 6
months’ duration that discussed these parameters,[29,30,38,43,46,47,50] or in a 12-month trial in 326
patients with end-of-dose deterioration or stable
parkinson’s disease (reported as an abstract).[52]
phase iii studies assessed liver enzyme levels with
 xxxd2000xxx  (administered for 6 to 12 months) and
no association between the drug and liver toxicity
was shown. the incidence of significant liver enzyme abnormalities (elevated  xxxg941xxx  or aspartate aminotransferase) was 0.8% in
both  xxxd2000xxx  and placebo recipients (n ≈ 1000).[54]
data from larger patient numbers are required to
confirm these findings, and such studies are ongoing.
there were no differences between  xxxd2000xxx 
and placebo groups in patients’ vital signs or ecg
results in the 2 large clinical trials discussed in section 4.[46,47]  xxxd2000xxx  has not been shown to
have any significant haemodynamic effects in padrugs 1999 jul; 58 (1)

tients with parkinson’s disease and in healthy volunteers in studies specifically assessing the cardiovascular changes with the drug (see section 2.4). in
addition, the administration of  xxxd2000xxx  and
levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor with the mao-b inhibitor selegiline did not affect various ecg parameters or vital signs in 16 patients with parkinson’s
disease in a double-blind placebo-controlled study
(reported as an abstract).[55]

holm & spencer

kinson’s disease did not affect mean values for
blood pressure or heart rate or cause ecg abnormalities.[50]
single dose  xxxd2000xxx  100 or 200mg did not
alter the pharmacokinetics of carbidopa, but higher
 xxxd2000xxx  doses of 400 and 800mg significantly
reduced the auc of the  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor in 1 study.[32] carbidopa was administered to healthy volunteers as controlled release levodopa/carbidopa
200/50mg.

6. drug interactions
7. dosage and administration
in addition to the beneficial pharmacokinetic
interaction between  xxxd2000xxx  and levodopa, inhibition of comt has the potential to affect the
metabolism of other exogenously administered
catecholamines (see section 2.3 for effects on endogenous catecholamines). additionally, when
administered with other agents that alter the metabolism of catecholamines, cardiovascular effects
could result.
 xxxd2000xxx  had no significant effect on plasma
concentrations or the elimination of epinephrine or
 xxxd2398xxx  when a 400mg dose of the comt
inhibitor was administered before each catecholamine in healthy volunteers.[28] however, heart
rate increases after  xxxd2398xxx  were significantly
greater (p < 0.05) when the drug was infused after
 xxxd2000xxx  than after placebo. differences in
epinephrine-induced tachycardia with versus without  xxxd2000xxx  were not significant.
coadministration of a single dose of  xxxd2000xxx 
200mg and the mao-a inhibitor moclobemide
150mg did not significantly alter the haemodynamic effects or plasma levels of unconjugated epinephrine or norepinephrine compared with placebo
or administration of each drug alone in healthy
volunteers.[27] similarly, no interaction occurred
between  xxxd2000xxx  200mg and imipramine 75mg
when the drugs were given together as a single dose
to healthy female volunteers. increases in heart
rate with the combination were similar to changes
observed after imipramine alone.[56] the concomitant use of  xxxd2000xxx  600 to 800 mg/day and the
mao-b inhibitor selegiline 10 mg/day for 14 days

 xxxd2000xxx  is indicated for the treatment of patients with parkinson’s disease and the ‘wearing
off’ phenomenon and it is recommended that the
drug is given at a dose of 200mg with each daily
dose of levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor.[31] the maximum recommended daily dosage of  xxxd2000xxx  is
2000 mg/day.[31] in clinical trials,  xxxd2000xxx  was
given with standard or controlled release formulations of levodopa plus an  xxxg618xxx  inhibitor, or with
levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor plus selegiline 10 mg/day,
and patients were generally allowed to continue
taking other antiparkinsonian drugs (dopamine
agonists, amantadine, anticholinergics and selegiline).
8. place of  xxxd2000xxx  in the
management of parkinson’s disease
levodopa is the most effective treatment for
parkinson’s disease, although this therapy is often
associated with a fluctuating response. in addition, there is currently debate as to how early in
the disease process levodopa therapy should be
initiated.[51] strategies to improve the benefits of
standard formulations of levodopa include using
controlled release formulations of the drug or dopamine receptor agonists, such as bromocriptine,
pergolide, pramipexole, cabergoline and  xxxd3145xxx . in addition, levodopa can be coadministered
with the mao-b inhibitor selegiline.[57] however,
each of these strategies is associated with disadvantages, and the addition of a comt inhibitor such
as  xxxd2000xxx  to levodopa therapy has a number of
potential benefits, as discussed in section 1.
drugs 1999 jul; 58 (1)

 xxxd2000xxx : a review

 xxxd2000xxx  is a potent, specific and reversible
comt inhibitor. the drug has been shown to act
peripherally, but not centrally, when given at clinically effective doses. the auc and t1⁄2 of levodopa are increased after  xxxd2000xxx  administration,
whereas cmax and tmax are generally not affected.
these effects contrast with those of controlled release levodopa, which delays the onset of action of
levodopa in addition to prolonging its duration of
action.[43]  xxxd2000xxx  is taken with each daily dose
of levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor, rather than being
given as a certain number of doses per day regardless of levodopa dosing, and therefore, in theory,
compliance with  xxxd2000xxx  therapy is likely to be
good.
the addition of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg to each
dose of levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor (up to 10 doses
per day) was shown to be effective for the treatment of patients with parkinson’s disease experiencing the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon. efficacy
and tolerability data are available from 2 large well
conducted studies of 6 months’ duration in a total
of 376 patients with parkinson’s disease, and also
from smaller short term trials, some of which
were blinded. the efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  has not
been assessed in patients with stable parkinson’s
disease.
daily ‘on’ time was increased by 1 to 1.2 hours
with 6 months’  xxxd2000xxx  therapy compared with
placebo, and in 1 trial daily ‘off’ time was decreased by 1.2 hours versus placebo. these improvements concurred with most changes in updrs scores after the same treatment period; the
total score and updrs subscales ii (activities of
daily living) and iii (motor function) scores, but
not subscale i (mentation, behaviour and mood),
favoured  xxxd2000xxx  at week 24.  xxxd2000xxx  also
reduced the mean daily levodopa dosage compared
with placebo, and investigators’ global assessments were better for  xxxd2000xxx  than placebo recipients. the beneficial effects of  xxxd2000xxx  were
also observed when the drug was administered for
short term periods (up to 14 days) with controlled
release formulations of levodopa plus an  xxxg618xxx

inhibitor or with standard levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor in addition to selegiline in small samples.
the most common adverse events of comt
inhibitors are dopaminergic events, which are related to their ability to potentiate the effects of
levodopa.[51] indeed, dyskinesia and nausea were
among the most common adverse events with  xxxd2000xxx  in studies of 6 months’ duration, and in
the preliminary report of a 12-month study in 326
patients with parkinson’s disease. clinical trials
suggest that lowering the levodopa dosage by approximately 10 to 20% may reduce the frequency
of dyskinesia. diarrhoea, constipation, abdominal
pain and urine discolouration are the most common
nondopaminergic events, although the latter event
is the only one to be consistently more common
with  xxxd2000xxx  than with placebo. adverse events
infrequently led to study discontinuation, with the
incidence being 5 to 7% in both  xxxd2000xxx  and
placebo groups in the 2 large clinical trials.
the comt inhibitor  xxxd3395xxx  has been associated with serious hepatic reactions, including
fulminant hepatitis, that may not be predictable
from liver function monitoring.[58]  xxxd2000xxx  did
not cause significant changes in biochemical or
haematological parameters in clinical studies of up
to 6 months’ duration or in the preliminary report
of a 12-month tolerability study. furthermore, no
association between  xxxd2000xxx  and liver toxicity
was shown in phase iii studies that assessed liver
enzyme levels in patients who were given the drug
for 6 to 12 months. however, data from larger patient numbers are required to confirm these findings: such studies are ongoing.
no significant changes in patients’ vital signs or
ecg results were reported with  xxxd2000xxx  in clinical trials of up to 6 months’ duration. pharmacodynamic data in patients with parkinson’s disease
and in volunteers at rest and performing exercise
confirm the lack of significant haemodynamic effects with  xxxd2000xxx . drug interaction data currently available demonstrated that  xxxd2000xxx 
generally did not affect the metabolism of exogenously administered catecholamines. furthermore,
drugs 1999 jul; 58 (1)

176

holm & spencer

the drug did not interact with moclobemide, imipramine or selegiline.
thus,  xxxd2000xxx  is a potent, specific, orally
acting comt inhibitor that can be administered
simultaneously with each dose of patients’ levodopa/ xxxg618xxx  inhibitor. the efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd2000xxx  administered with levodopa/
 xxxg618xxx  inhibitor have not yet been compared with
those of other strategies for the treatment of parkinson’s disease. however, once the decision to
initiate levodopa therapy has been made, studies
generally support the use of  xxxd2000xxx  as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with parkinson’s disease and the ‘wearing off’ phenomenon.
