background. apc8015 ( xxxd3205xxx ) is a cellular prostate cancer vaccine containing autologous antigen-presenting cells (apc) loaded with pa2024, a recombinant  xxxg46xxx /granulocyte-macrophage– colony-stimulating
factor fusion protein, as the immunogen. bevacizumab is a recombinant antibody
against  xxxg2413xxx , a proangiogenic protein with inhibitory
effects on apc. a clinical trial was conducted to determine the prostate-speciﬁc
antigen (psa) and immunomodulatory effects of this combination immunotherapy.
methods. patients with androgen-dependent prostate cancer who had received
prior deﬁnitive therapy with nonmetastatic, recurrent disease as manifested by a
rising psa of between 0.4 ng/ml and 6.0 ng/ml were enrolled. apc8015 was given
intravenously(i.v.) on weeks 0, 2, and 4. bevacizumab was given at a dose of 10
mg/kg i.v. on weeks 0, 2, 4, and every 2 weeks thereafter until toxicity or disease
progression. psa changes were recorded and the psa doubling time (psadt) was
calculated. immune response versus pa2024 was measured at baseline and after
treatment by t-cell proliferation and interferon-␥ enzyme-linked immunospot
(elispot) assays.
results. twenty-two patients were treated. one patient achieved a ⱖ50% decrease in psa. nine patients exhibited some decrease in psa from baseline, ranging
from 6% to 72%, with the psa of 3 patients decreasing at least 25%. the median
pretreatment psadt for the 20 evaluable patients was 6.9 months and the median
posttreatment psadt was 12.7 months (p ⫽ .01). all patients demonstrated induction of an immune response against pa2024.
conclusions. the combination of apc8015 and bevacizumab induces an immune
response and modulates psa in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate
cancer. cancer 2006;107:67–74. © 2006 american cancer society.

p

atients with recurrent prostate cancer after deﬁnitive local therapy
are often asymptomatic, with rising prostate-speciﬁc antigen
(psa) values as the sole manifestation of recurrence. although androgen deprivation is a treatment option, the associated sequelae, including loss of libido, fatigue, anemia, and osteoporosis, make this
therapy unacceptable to some patients. a window of opportunity
exists in these patients with biochemically recurrent disease to investigate novel therapeutics before the initiation of hormone therapy.

immune-based treatments may ideally be applied in
these otherwise healthy patients with intact immune
function and minimal disease burden.
apc8015 ( xxxd3205xxx ; provenge威; dendreon
corporation, seattle, wa) is a cellular vaccine containing autologous antigen-presenting cells (apc) loaded
with pa2024, a recombinant  xxxg46xxx  (pap)/granulocyte-macrophage–  xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf) fusion protein, as the immunogen. clinical trials of apc8015 in patients with
androgen-independent prostate cancer have demonstrated safety and clinical activity consisting of psa
declines, an objective response, and prolongation of
overall survival versus placebo.1,2 in addition, induction of t-cell responses against pa2024 or native pap
have been demonstrated. although further investigation is required to provide a causal link between these
immune responses and the clinical beneﬁt, the results
provide a foundation on which to build immunotherapeutic approaches in prostate cancer.
a greater understanding of the factors limiting
dendritic cell (dc)-based immunotherapy such as
apc8015 would allow for rational combinations to
improve the antitumor immune response and ultimately enhance the clinical effect. in animal models,
inadequate dc differentiation caused by tumor-derived factors, including vascular endothelial growth
factor (vegf), may contribute to defective dc function in tumor-bearing hosts.3,4 in this model, infusion
of vegf resulted in decreased dc production. furthermore, neutralizing  xxxd328xxx  antibody abrogated
the inhibition of dc differentiation that was caused by
tumor cell supernatant ﬂuids.5 therefore, tumor-produced vegf may contribute to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and limit the generation of an antitumor immune response. in this same
model, when tumor-bearing mice that had been immunized with peptide-pulsed dc were treated with an
 xxxd328xxx  antibody, a more pronounced and longerlasting antitumor immune response was observed
compared with mice treated with peptide-pulsed dc
alone. these data suggest that the inhibition of vegf
may augment the antitumor effect of dc-based immunotherapy.
based on these data, it was hypothesized that
inhibition of vegf by bevacizumab could augment
the immunostimulatory and antitumor effects of
ap8015. neutralization of vegf could lead to augmentation of antitumor immune responses generated
by apc8015, and therefore an enhanced clinical effect.
therefore, a phase ii trial was undertaken to determine the safety and psa modulating effects of this
combination therapy.

materials and methods
patients with histologically diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the prostate who had undergone prior deﬁnitive therapy for prostate cancer consisting of external
beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, or radical prostatectomy and who had experienced subsequent disease
progression were eligible. patients treated with adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy after radical prostatectomy were eligible provided the postprostatectomy
psa level was never ⬎6.0 ng/ml. progressive disease,
deﬁned as 2 climbing psa values between 0.4 ng/ml
and 6.0 ng/ml measured at least 2 weeks apart, was
required. patients with a local recurrence or evidence
of metastases on bone scan or computed tomography
(ct) scan were excluded. an eastern cooperative oncology group performance status of 0 or 1 was required. adequate renal, hepatic, and bone marrow
function (deﬁned as blood urea nitrogen and serum
creatinine ⬍2.0 ⫻ the upper limit of normal, total
bilirubin and serum aspartate aminotransferase ⬍2.0
⫻ the upper limit of normal, a white blood cell count
ⱖ2500/␮l, an absolute neutrophil count ⱖ1000/␮l,
and a platelet count ⱖ100,000/␮l) were required. all
patients provided signed, informed consent approved
by the university of california san francisco committee on human research.
prior hormonal therapy of any type for the treatment of progressive disease was not permitted (up to
6 months of prior hormonal therapy used in an adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting was permitted, but the last
day of effective androgen deprivation must have been
at least 3 months before study entry). prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or vegf-targeted therapy
for prostate cancer was not permitted. patients with a
history of deep venous thrombosis, bleeding disorder,
or active autoimmune disease were excluded. use of
therapeutic oral or parenteral anticoagulants within
10 days preceding the ﬁrst bevacizumab infusion was
prohibited. patients with clinically signiﬁcant cardiac
or pulmonary disease, uncontrolled infection, a history of surgery within the prior 4 weeks, central nervous system disease, active second malignancy,
known human immunodeﬁciency virus (hiv) infection, or hepatitis, or who were receivin current systemic steroid therapy were excluded.

treatment
treatment was administered on an outpatient basis
(fig. 1). on weeks 0, 2, and 4, apc8015 was prepared
and administered as previously described.1 patients
received the maximum manufacturable dose of
apc8015, an estimated 12 ⫻ 109 nucleated cells/m2,
with a minimum dose of 3 ⫻ 106 dcs for all patients.

the exception of grade 3 hypertension that was well
controlled with oral medication, grade 3 nausea and
vomiting that was controlled by antiemetics, and
grade 4 hematologic toxicities.

figure 1. on weeks 0, 2, and 4, apc8015 was infused 48 hours after each
leukapheresis procedure was completed. bevacizumab (at a dose of 10 mg/kg
intravenously) was administered on weeks 0, 2, and 4 after apc8015 infusion
and continued every 2 weeks thereafter until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. psa indicates prostate-speciﬁc antigen; rp, radical prostatectomy, xrt, radiation therapy, pd, progressive disease; dc, dendritic cells, apc,

immune monitoring
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were
isolated from each patient’s leukapheresis at week 0
(pct-cell processing center, mountain view, ca), frozen in media/serum containing  xxxd1896xxx 
(dmso), and stored in liquid nitrogen. follow-up
pbmc samples (week 8 and/or week 12) were isolated
from whole blood at the university of california at san
francisco, frozen in media/serum containing dmso,
and stored in liquid nitrogen. all samples were
shipped overnight on dry ice to dendreon corporation (seattle, wa) for testing.
all assay setup and pbmc preparation was performed under sterile conditions. subject samples from
all timepoints available were thawed and assayed on
the same day. samples were thawed and counted and
viability was calculated using trypan blue exclusion.

patients received 3 total doses of apc8015. patients
were premedicated 30 minutes before apc8015 infusion with acetaminophen at a dose of 650 mg given
orally and diphenhydramine at a dose of 50 mg given
orally. bevacizumab (at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously) was administered on weeks 0, 2, and 4 after
apc8015 infusion and continued every 2 weeks thereafter. the initial bevacizumab dose was administered
over a minimum of 90 minutes. if no adverse reactions
occurred, the second dose was administered over a
minimum of 60 minutes. again, if no adverse reactions
occurred, the third and subsequent doses were administered over a minimum of 30 minutes. treatment
with bevacizumab was continued every 2 weeks until
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
psa was assessed at baseline and every 4 weeks.
treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or
disease progression, deﬁned as a doubling of the nadir
or pretreatment psa value (whichever was lowest) to
at least 4 ng/ml maintained for at least 2 measurements that were at least 2 weeks apart, or the development of distant metastases. patients underwent a
repeat bone scan and ct scan of the abdomen and
pelvis at the time of disease progression by psa criteria or as clinically indicated.

proliferation assays were set up in triplicate in a 96well u-bottom plate. pbmcs (1 ⫻ 105 cells/well) were
incubated with the indicated ﬁnal concentration of
pa2024. control wells contained media only. assays
were incubated for 6 days, pulsed with 3h-thymidine
(amersham, piscataway, nj) for the last 18 hours of
incubation, and then harvested to ﬁlter mats using a
tomtec plate harvester. after the addition of scintillation cocktail (perkin elmer/wallac, norwalk, ct), assays were counted using a wallac beta scintillation
counter. readout was reported in counts per minute
(cpm). a stimulation index (si) was calculated using
the median cpm experimental/median cpm control
ratio for each patient at each timepoint with an evaluable blood sample (week 0/baseline, week 8, and
week 12).

criteria (version 3.0) were utilized to assess toxicity.
assessment of urinary protein by dipstick was performed before each dose of bevacizumab. if protein
was found at a level of 2⫹ on dipstick, a 24-hour urine
collection was performed. for a 24-hour urine excretion of ⬎2000 mg or ⱖ3⫹ on dipstick, bevacizumab
was held until protein was ⬍1⫹. if protein remained
ⱖ1⫹ for ⱖ6 weeks patients were removed from therapy. patients were removed from therapy for grade 2

wells of multiscreen-ha plates (millipore, bedford,
ma) were coated overnight at 4°c with 100 ␮l of
antihuman interferon-␥ (ifn-␥) antibody (clone
1-dik; mabtech, nacka, sweden) at 15 ␮g/ml in dulbecco-phosphate-buffered saline (d-pbs) (life technologies, baltimore, md). after coating, plates were

media alone. assays were incubated at 37°c for 40-48
hours. after 2 days cells and antigen were washed
from the plate using pbst. the detection antibody,
100 ␮l of biotinylated antihuman ifn-␥ (mabtech,
clone 7-b6-1), was added to wells at 1 ␮g/ml in pbst.
assays were incubated for 2.5 hours at room temperature. plates were washed 6 times with pbst and 100
␮l of streptavidin alkaline phosphatase (mabtech) diluted 1:1000 in pbst was added to assay wells. assays
were incubated for 1.5 hours and then washed 6 times
with pbst. then, 1-step bcip/nbt solution (pierce,
rockford, il) was added at 100 ␮l per well and incubated for 12 minutes to develop spots. to stop color
development, wells were rinsed with sterile water.
plates were scanned and spots counted using an immunospot analyzer and software (cellular technology, cleveland, oh). results are reported as spots per
3 ⫻ 105 pbmc minus control spots for each timepoint.

statistical analysis
the primary study endpoint for determining the sample size was the proportion of patients achieving a
ⱖ50% psa decline compared with baseline. the sample size for accrual utilized a 2-stage design. treatment of 43 patients would be sufﬁcient to determine if
at least 30% of patients demonstrated psa declines of
ⱖ50% compared with a null hypothesis of 15% of
patients. for the interim analysis, if ⱕ 2 patients experienced a psa decline of ⱖ50% among the ﬁrst 20
patients treated, then accrual would stop. the probability of stopping accrual if the null hypothesis was
true was 40% and 4% if the alternative was true. if
accrual continued to 43, then the null hypothesis
would be rejected if ⱖ11 responses were observed.
the overall level of signiﬁcance was .05 and power was
0.78. accrual was not stopped to perform the interim
analysis for efﬁcacy.
for analysis of the data, the linear rate of increase
of the psa on the natural log (ln) scale over time
before entry on protocol as well as the change in ln
psa calculated from the start of treatment were each
estimated by the slope. the psa doubling time both
pretreatment and posttreatment were estimated using
the relation of ln 2 divided by the slope. if a continuous decline in the rate of psa with treatment was
observed, this then resulted in a negative slope, and a
doubling time could not be estimated. if the patient
initially experienced a decline in psa, then the posttreatment slope was calculated starting from the psa
nadir. time to disease progression was deﬁned as the
time from the initiation of therapy to the ﬁrst psa

opment of objective disease progression, whichever
came ﬁrst. the probability of remaining free of progressive disease and time to psa nadir were estimated
using the kaplan–meier product limit method. the
wilcoxon matched pairs test was used to compare the
distributions for the pre- and posttreatment doubling
times.

results
patient characteristics
twenty-two patients were enrolled from october 2001
to november 2003. further accrual was suspended
based on the results of the interim analysis. patients
were typical of those with biochemical recurrence of
prostate cancer (table 1). the median age of patients
was 70 years. primary therapy included radiation
(xrt) in 3 patients, radical prostatectomy (rp) in 5
patients, or rp followed by adjuvant xrt in 14 patients. six patients (3 who received prior xrt, 1 who
received rp, and 2 who received rp followed by xrt)
had received neoadjuvant or adjuvant hormonal therapy. these patients received a median of 4.5 months
of hormone therapy (range, 3-6 months) that was discontinued for a median of 49 months (range, 18-60
months) before protocol treatment. the median maximum pretreatment psa was 2.3 ng/ml (range, 0.5-5.1
ng/ml). fourteen patients (64%) had a gleason score
of ⱖ7.

observed until the achievement of a psa nadir at the cessation of therapy
(week 72). a rising psa was noted on week 108, 7 months after protocol
therapy was discontinued. up arrow indicates the initiation of protocol therapy;
down arrow, end of protocol therapy.

psa changes
twenty-one patients were evaluable for assessment of
posttreatment psa changes with a median follow-up
of 11.4 months. one patient was not evaluable because of withdrawal of consent before repeat psa
measurement. this patient was included in the toxicity analysis. a psa decline of ⱖ50% was observed in 1
patient (5%; 95% conﬁdence interval, 0-24%). this
patient had a gleason 3 ⫹ 4 adenocarcinoma status
after rp and adjuvant xrt. he had not received hormonal therapy at any time before protocol enrollment.
figure 2 depicts the ln psa over time for this patient.
an initial increase in psa from a baseline value of 2.7
ng/ml to 5.6 ng/ml at week 12 was followed by a
subsequent decrease in psa to a nadir value of 0.78
ng/ml at week 72. this patient came off study with a
psa of 0.84 ng/ml due to toxicity (proteinuria) at
week 88 after initiation of protocol therapy. this patient remained off all therapy with a stable psa until 7
months after the last bevacizumab infusion (week
108), at which time a rising psa was noted. nine
patients exhibited some decrease in psa from baseline
ranging from 6% to 72% with 3 patients decreasing at
least 25% (table 2). for these 9 patients, the median
time to psa nadir was 5.8 months (range, 1.8-17.2

twelve patients developed progressive disease by
psa criteria, including 1 patient with only a single psa
value reaching the deﬁnition for progessive disease
but who refused further psa evaluation. nine of these
patients had a follow-up bone scan and ct scan, and
none developed metastatic disease. four patients
were removed from study for toxicity (vide infra). five
patients remained on study at the time of last followup with treatment durations ranging from 18 months
to 28 months.

toxicity
the majority of side effects were grade 1 or 2 including fatigue and infusion-related chills, myalgias, and
fever (table 3). a total of 6 grade 3 toxicities were
observed leading to the discontinuation of therapy in
4 patients (congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal
hemorrhage, cerebrovascular ischemia, and proteinuria). there were no grade 4 toxicities.
grade 3 congestive heart failure was observed in a

gram revealed a dilated left ventricle with an ejection
fraction of 23%. no ischemia was noted on electrocardiogram and coronary catheterization revealed normal coronary arteries. symptoms resolved and ejection fraction improved to 45% with supportive
medication 2 months after discontinuation of protocol
therapy.
a grade 3 gastrointestinal bleed was experienced
by a 74-year-old man with a history of salvage radiation after prostatectomy and nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory (nsaid) use for gout who presented with guaiac-positive stools requiring blood transfusion. lower
bowel endoscopy did not reveal an active bleeding
source and the event was felt likely related to nsaid
use, but a contribution of bevacizumab could not be
entirely ruled out. concurrently, the patient demonstrated psa progression and was taken off study.
a grade 3 cerebrovascular ischemia was observed
in a 60-year-old man with a history of atrial ﬁbrillation
who had undergone cardioversion to normal sinus
rhythm 2 years prior. the patient then represented in
atrial ﬁbrillation after 10 months of therapy requiring
repeat cardioversion. there was no evidence of ischemia or cardiac thrombus at that time, and the patient
was placed on coumadin. the atrial ﬁbrillation was
believed to be unlikely related to protocol therapy.

three days after this episode, the patient presented
with expressive aphasia and right arm weakness.
there was no radiographic evidence of cerebrovascular ischemia or bleeding on ct scan and the symptoms resolved spontaneously. this event was believed
to possibly be related to protocol therapy and the
patient was removed from study.
the patient who exhibited a ⱖ50% psa decline
developed proteinuria 22 months after the initiation of
protocol therapy, which remained ⱖ1⫹ for ⬎6 weeks
and therefore, per prespeciﬁed protocol criteria, was
removed from therapy. urinalysis performed 9
months after cessation of bevacizumab therapy demonstrated resolution of proteinuria.
two additional grade 3 events were observed. a
patient with baseline hypertension requiring 3 medicines developed grade 3 hypertension after cycle 3
controlled with adjustment of existing antihypertension medications. although blood pressure was controlled, the patient decided to withdraw consent at
cycle 5. blood pressure returned to baseline status
within 2 weeks after discontinuation of bevacizumab.
another patient demonstrated grade 3 facial angioedema at cycle 58 of therapy, which was believed to
most likely be related to food allergies or recently
started lisinopril that resolved with prednisone and
diphenhydramine. the patient received 2 subsequent
doses of bevacizumab without incident before being
taken off study for progressive disease.

immune monitoring
t-cell proliferation
nine patients had pre- and posttreatment blood samples evaluable for measurement of t-cell proliferation.
stimulation indices (si) using a 50 ␮g/ml concentration of pa2024 versus control are reported for baseline
and highest posttreatment timepoint. the posttreatment timepoint utilized was dependent on availability
of samples for analysis and was week 8 in 6 patients
and week 12 in 3 patients. all 9 patients demonstrated
increased t-cell proliferation versus antigen posttreatment compared with baseline. the median si at week
0 was 2.3 (range, 0.4-4.0) and the median posttreatment si was 25.9 (range, 5.2-308.4). due to the different follow-up observation times for a limited number
of patients, estimating the correlation of t-cell proliferation and psa modulation was precluded. of note,
however, the patient with the 50% psa decline demonstrated the greatest increase in t-cell proliferation
from an si of 2.3 at baseline to 308.4 at week 8. figure

six patients had pre- and posttreatment blood samples evaluable for measurement of ifn-␥ production
via elispot. all 6 patients demonstrated increased
ifn-␥ producing t-cells versus pa2024 posttreatment
compared with baseline. the median number of spots
(minus control spots) for 3 ⫻ 105 pbmcs at a pa2024
concentration of 50 mg/␮l was 1 (range, 0-3) at baseline and the median number of spots posttreatment
was 87 (range, 13-493).

discussion
apc8015 treatment in combination with bevacizumab
in patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer patients resulted in psa modulation as demonstrated by psa declines and alterations in psa doubling time. furthermore, immunomodulation was
demonstrated by induction of an immune response
against pa2024.
despite these encouraging observations, the current study must be interpreted as hypothesis-generating due to several limitations. this small, single-arm
study without a concurrent control arm of either
apc8015 or bevacizumab monotherapy did not allow
estimation of the potential additive or synergistic clinical or immune effects of this combination. nevertheless, a study of apc8015 monotherapy in this group of
patients appeared to have less psa-modulating effects, with no psa declines ⬎50% and no signiﬁcant
difference between pre- and posttreatment psadt.6
in addition, a study of bevacizumab monotherapy in
patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer

failed to demonstrate objective responses or psa declines ⬎50%.7 direct comparison among these trials is
not possible, however, and no immune parameters
were measured in the monotherapy trials. furthermore, prospective investigation in a randomized setting is needed for a more precise estimation of the
potential additive or synergistic immunomodulatory
or clinical beneﬁt of this combination therapy.
the serious cardiac and bleeding toxicities potentially related to therapy require close monitoring with
further investigation of this combination. although
each agent has demonstrated acceptable safety as
monotherapy in large populations of patients, the
combination of therapy and/or patient population
may result in increased or unique toxicity.
induction of an immune response versus pa2024
was demonstrated in the current study. although the
clinical relevance of this effect in prostate cancer is
unknown, the patient with the greatest psa effect from
therapy also demonstrated the greatest induction of
an immune response. in addition, the magnitude of
the pa2024-speciﬁc t-cell immune response noted in
this study is consistent with that seen in other studies
with apc8015.1,2 the immunologic assays performed
in the current study were limited to a small number of
patients, precluding statistical correlation of induced
immune response and psa modulation. no functional
testing of induced immune cells (e.g., cytotoxic effect
against prostate cancer cells) was undertaken to investigate the relevance of the immune cells generated.
furthermore, as noted earlier, the putative mechanism of effect of apc8015 and potential enhancement
from vegf blockade is through the dc component.
no direct assay of dc type, quantity, or function was
undertaken in this study. availability of adequate
numbers of cells for assays was limited, and therefore
assays to measure t-cell activity against the vaccine
immunogen were employed because ultimately it is
cytotoxic t-cells that are believed to exert the antitumor effect of immunotherapy. last, the posttreatment
immune assays were performed at limited timepoints.
the timing of induction of an immune response from
this therapy is unknown, and collection of blood at
additional timepoints could have allowed for further
characterization of the immune response. such insight could also assist in the design of future clinical
trials of this approach in determining the need for
booster apc8015 treatments in the case of an insufﬁcient or waning immune response. therefore, although the observation of an induced immune response against the immunogen is encouraging,
further investigation in a larger number of patients is
needed to more deﬁnitively characterize the immune
response generated by this combination. in addition,

deﬁning the precise correlation between immune and
clinical endpoints remains a signiﬁcant challenge in
trials of novel immunotherapies.
absolute psa declines are delayed and often limited after immunotherapy, further compounding interpretation of the clinical activity of a given approach
in a single-arm study.1 indeed, the most dramatic psa
effect observed in the current study occurred only
after a signiﬁcant psa rise. therefore, absolute psa
changes may be of limited value and alternative measures of psa modulation are more frequently being
employed. the relevance of psadt modulation in this
disease state is not yet established to our knowledge,
and placebo-controlled randomized studies in this
setting lend caution to overinterpretation of differences in pretreatment and posttreatment psadt.8 the
use of a limited number of psa values and a short
duration of collection limits the precision of psadt
estimation. additional investigation to validate intermediate endpoints (e.g., immune parameters or psa
modulation) is needed for immunotherapy trials in
this population of patients.
despite these limitations, the preclinical data suggesting that vegf blockade may enhance immune
function and the psa modulating and immune effects
observed in this study warrant further investigation. a
randomized trial of apc8015 with or without bevacizumab in patients with hormon-refractory prostate
cancer is being considered to further investigate the
clinical and immunologic effects achieved with the
addition of vegf blockade to apc8015.
