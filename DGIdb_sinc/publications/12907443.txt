effects of  xxxd1823xxx  on fetal hemoglobin levels, red cell adhesion, and hematopoietic differentiation in patients with sickle cell dis...  fetal hemoglobin (hbf) decreases polymerization of sickle hemoglobin (hbs) and improves outcomes in sickle cell disease (ssd). therefore, a therapeutic goal in ssd is pharmacologic reactivation of hbf. silencing of the gamma-globin (hbf) gene is associated with dna methylation. the cytosine analog  xxxd1823xxx  ( xxxd1823xxx ) hypomethylates dna by inhibiting dna methyltransferase. we examined if subcutaneous  xxxd1823xxx  could increase hbf levels and improve ssd pathophysiology without cytotoxicity. eight symptomatic ssd patients resistant or intolerant of standard treatment with hydroxyurea received  xxxd1823xxx  0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously 1 to 3 times per week in 2 cycles of 6-week duration. treatment decreased neutrophils and increased mean hbf (6.5% to 20.4%, p <.0001) and mean total hemoglobin (76 to 96 g/l [7.6 to 9.6 g/dl], p <.001). features of vaso-occlusive crisis pathophysiology such as red cell adhesion, endothelial damage, and coagulation pathway activity significantly improved. gamma-globin gene promoter methylation decreased, and platelets and the proportion of megakaryocytes and erythroid cells in the marrow increased without a decrease in marrow cellularity, consistent with a dna hypomethylating, noncytotoxic mechanism of action. weekly subcutaneous  xxxd1823xxx  produces cumulative increases in hbf and total hemoglobin through a noncytotoxic mechanism of action. chronic dosing and sustained increases in hemoglobin f and total hemoglobin levels may be possible. further studies in ssd and thalassemia are indicated.
