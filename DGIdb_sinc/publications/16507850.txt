differences in the glucocorticoid to
 xxxg1737xxx  selectivity of inhaled
glucocorticoids
m. issar*, s. sahasranaman*, p. buchwald# and g. hochhaus*

abstract: due to the high affinity of new inhaled corticosteroids (ics) towards the
 xxxg1601xxx  (gr), and because of the similarities between the binding domains of
the gr and the  xxxg1737xxx  (pr), the present study focused on assessing the relative
binding affinities (rba) of glucocorticoids (systemic and ics) to pr (rbapr). by comparison with
the affinities towards the gr (rbagr) the binding selectivities were also assessed.
in general, the selectivity of the investigated glucocorticoids showed a decreasing trend with
increasing lipophilicity. when orally administered, less lipophilic glucocorticoids showed the
highest selectivity, with rbagr/rbapr ratios of 1,375, 760 and 476 for betamethasone,
 xxxd294xxx  and dexamethasone, respectively.
for ics,  xxxd2665xxx , the most lipophilic steroid, was the least selective (1.1), followed
by  xxxd294xxx  monopropionate (9),  xxxd2145xxx  (12),  xxxd3418xxx 
(18), mometasone (25) and budesonide (44), which shows the highest selectivity among inhaled
glucocorticoids.
in conclusion, the present study revealed that there are differences in selectivity among
commercially available glucocorticoids. future clinical studies are needed to investigate whether
the high affinity of some of the investigated glucocorticoids to the  xxxg1737xxx  is of
clinical relevance.

of the present study to assess the selectivity
of currently used inhaled and systemic glucocorticoids towards the gr, by comparing
their relative receptor affinities at the gr and
the pr.

nhaled corticosteroids (ics) are the drugs of
choice in the treatment of allergy and asthma.
the newer ics show high potencies with
several-fold greater affinities to the  xxxg1601xxx  (gr) than the corticosteroids used
for systemic therapy. however, side-effects of
ics can be induced after absorption into the
systemic circulatory system when they interact
with systemic or peripheral grs. also, some of
the endogenous glucocorticoids, such as corticosterone and deoxycorticosterone, have been
reported to bind to the  xxxg1737xxx 
(pr) [1]. progesterone (prog), in turn, has been
shown to bind to the gr nonselectively [2]. this
cross-reactivity of ligands between different
nuclear receptors is suggestive of a close homology in binding domains between the grs and
the other members of the steroid receptor family,
such as the pr [3]. recently, functional assays
conducted by austin et al. [4] have demonstrated
that the glucocorticoid  xxxd2665xxx  (mf)
lacks gr selectivity. as potential systemic sideeffects of other inhaled glucocorticoids could
be related to the binding to the pr, it was the aim

solvents were obtained from sigma chemicals co. and fisher
scientific co. (cincinnati, oh, usa).
gr binding in rat lung cytosol
solutions
the various dilutions for dex (0.001–1.0 mm), fp, mf and mo
(0.01–100 mm) were prepared in methanol.
preparation of cytosol
the animal protocol was approved by the local institutional
animal care and use committee (iacuc) at the university
of florida (gainesville, fl, usa). sprague dawley rats
(250¡25 g) were obtained from harlan (indianapolis, in,
usa). the rats were anaesthetised using a mixture of
ketamine, xylazine and  xxxd60xxx  (3:3:1 v/v) and were
then decapitated. the lungs were removed and homogenised
in eight volumes of ice-cold incubation buffer (10 mm tris/
hcl, 10 mm  xxxd3216xxx , 2 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol).
the homogenate was incubated with 5% w/v charcoal
suspension in deionised water for 10 min. the homogenate
was then centrifuged for 20 min at 40,0006g in a j2 rotor of a
beckman centrifuge to obtain the cytosol. fresh cytosol was
prepared and used for all the individual experiments.
competitive gr assay
a 20 ml quantity of the drug solution in methanol was added
to pre-chilled tubes. blank methanol was used for the
determination of total binding. nonspecific binding was
determined after the addition of 20 ml of 100 mm unlabelled
taa (10 mm in the final incubation mixture). subsequently,
20 ml of 100 nm 3h-taa solution (10 nm in final incubation
mixture) was then added to all tubes. the tubes were
immediately vortexed after the addition of 160 ml of the lung
cytosol was added followed by incubation at 4uc for 24 h.
after incubation, 200 ml of 5% w/v charcoal suspension (in
water) was added to the tubes to remove the excess unbound
radioactivity. the tubes were vortexed and 300 ml of the
supernatant was transferred to the scintillation vials. a 5-ml
quantity of the scintillation cocktail was added and the
scintillation vials were read in a liquid scintillation counter
(ls 5000 td; beckman instruments inc., palo alto, ca, usa).
for some glucocorticoids, previously determined relative
binding affinity (rba)gr values for the human gr were used
because the rbagr values for rats correlate well with humans
[5] and the experimental conditions for the binding experiments were identical.
pr binding assay experiments in sheep uterus
cytosol
solutions
the various dilutions for the steroids used were prepared in
methanol and were as follows: prog (0.01–100 mm); dex
(0.03–10000 mm); bet (0.3–10000 mm); mf (0.01–100 mm); fp
(0.01–100 mm); mo (0.01–100 mm); bmp (0.01–100 mm);
beclo (0.03–1000 mm); bud (0.01–100 mm); and taa (0.03–
100 mm).
preparation of cytosol
a uterus from a pregnant sheep was used as the source for the
pr, as this tissue provided sufficient prs with low nonspecific
binding. the animal protocol was approved by the local
512

volume 27 number 3

m. issar et al.

iacuc at the university of florida. the personnel handling
the tissue were equipped with personal protective equipment
to prevent an exposure to coxiella burnetii, which is normally
present in sheep. all procedures involved in the homogenisation of the tissue were conducted under a hooded environment. the sheep uterus tissue was obtained from a pregnant
sheep, which had been sacrificed for another experimental setup. the tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
-80uc for no more than 4 days. on the day of the experiment,
the tissues were dipped in liquid nitrogen for 1 min and then
pulverised. the tissue was homogenised further after the
addition of four volumes of ice-cold incubation buffer (10 mm
tris/hcl, 10 mm  xxxd3216xxx , 2 mm 1,4-dithioerythritol) using a bio homogeniser (5 s, low speed, with 30-s cooldown period between each step). the homogenate was
incubated with 5% w/v charcoal suspension (in deionised
water) for 10 min to remove the endogenous progestins. the
homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 40,0006g in a beckman
high-speed centrifuge using a ja-20 fixed angle rotor. the
resulting aqueous supernatant (cytosol) was used on the same
day of the experiment. fresh cytosol was prepared and used
for all the individual experiments.
competitive pr assay
competitive binding experiments were performed with the
prog ligand [6,7-3h]-org-2058 as tracer. this ligand has
previously been shown to bind specifically to the pr, allowing
selective assessment of the pr binding for the competitors of
interests. displacement of this tracer from the pr by unlabelled
glucocorticoids was assessed in sheep uterus cytosol. portions
of the cytosol (160 ml) were incubated with 20 ml of 20 nm
tritium-labelled [6,7-3h]-org-2058 solution (final concentration in the incubation mixture of 2 nm) and the same volume
of varying concentrations of the competitor (prepared in
incubation buffer containing 50% ethanol). after 24-h incubation time, the unbound ligand was removed by the addition of
200 ml of activated charcoal suspension (5% w/v in deionised
water). the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 0–4uc and
then centrifuged for 5 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm. the radioactivity
in 300 ml of the supernatant was determined using liquid
scintillation counting (beckman instruments inc.). nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 2610-5 m
of unlabelled prog. nonspecific binding was always ,15% of
the total binding. all determinations were performed in
duplicate and the entire experiment was repeated on three
different occasions.
data analysis
the concentration of test drug necessary to reduce specific
binding of tracer by 50% (ic50) of the investigated steroids
(competitor concentration necessary to displace 50% of the
specific 3h-org-2058 or 3h-taa from the receptor site) and
the slope factors of the resulting competition curves were
determined by the nonlinear curve-fitting procedure using
scientist1 (micromath, salt lake city, ut, usa). the data was
fitted to the following maximum tracer binding (emax) model
to obtain the estimates of the specific binding by the ligand in
the absence of competitor (bmax) and ic50. the emax model is
generally used to describe competition experiments in which
the receptor is in equilibrium between a constant concentration
of radioactive tracer and unlabelled test substance. increasing

molecular modelling
log octanol–water partition coefficients (logp, a measure of the
lipophilicity of a molecule) were calculated as described
previously [6]. calculated values represent the average of
three computed values: clogp (from chemdraw ultra 7.0),
acd/logp, and qlogp [7]. values calculated by this procedure were found to be in very good agreement with
experimental logp values, where available. structures  xxxd3023xxx 
(for the human pr complexed with prog) [8], 1e3k (for the
human pr complexed with  xxxd2631xxx ) [9] and 1m2z (for
the human gr complexed with dex) [10] were obtained from
the protein data bank, and are displayed using ds viewerpro
5.0 (accelrys inc., san diego, ca, usa). corticosteroid
structures (bud, bmp, fp and mf) were individually, fully
geometry-optimised using am1 semi-empirical quantum
chemical calculations [11] in cache 5.0 (fujitsu, ltd, chiba,
japan). they were then superimposed with the receptor-bound
ligands by discovery studio’s (accelrys inc.) molecular overlay algorithm within viewerpro 5.0 (accelrys inc.) using a
targeted root mean square deviation-minimising alignment on
the ring-fusion atoms of the steroid structure (c5, c8, c9, c10,
c14 and c13).
results
the rbas of the investigated glucocorticoids to the pr and gr
were determined by competition binding experiments in
cytosol of sheep uterus and rat lung, respectively. the rbas
of bmp, beclo, bet, taa and prog to the gr were taken
from previous studies for the human gr for calculation of gr
selectivity [12]. this was reasonable because the binding
properties of the rat and human receptors for commercially
available glucocorticoids are the same [13]. the binding curves
resulting from a typical set of experiments conducted with
sheep uterus and rat lung cytosol are shown in figures 1 and 2,

the concentration of test substance (c) will displace the tracer
from the receptor and result in the tracer being bound only to
nonspecific binding elements (e.g. albumin). the concentration
needed to displace 50% of the tracer from the receptor binding
site can be used to describe the affinity of the test substance to
the receptor. the total tracer binding obtained at any given
competitor concentration (desintegrations per min; dpm) is
given by the following equation:

resulting selectivities are shown in tables 1 and 2 and figure 3.
figure 4 shows the relationship between the logarithm of gr
versus pr selectivity and logp values with a correlation
coefficient of 0.7499 for the different glucocorticoids (n59).
results of molecular models superimposing different ligands

dex, bmp and fp (data not shown).
discussion
some of the endogenous glucocorticoids have been reported to
be nonselective towards the gr by binding to the pr. raynaud
and coworkers [1, 14] showed that synthetic glucocorticoids,
such as taa and  xxxd2128xxx , have the ability to
bind to the pr indicating low gr selectivity. recently, cellbased functional assays conducted by austin et al. [4] have
shown that mf interacts with the pr as an agonist, with much

higher activity than fp. the present study investigated a wide
range of clinically employed glucocorticoids for their binding to the gr and pr and assessed their selectivity. gr
affinities determined in the current study were in agreement
with previously published work for the human and rat gr [1,
5, 13–17].
it has been previously established that the binding forces that
are responsible for interaction of steroidal ligands with the gr
are hydrophobic in nature, and a good correlation between the
lipophilicity of the ligand and the gr rba exists [6, 12, 13].
interestingly, the current data (fig. 3) suggest that lipophilicity
of the tested steroids also correlates with gr selectivity, with

lower selectivity associated with higher logp values of the
steroid.
the data obtained in the present study showed that some of
the inhaled glucocorticoids displayed reduced gr selectivity.
mcguire et al. [18] have shown that the presence of a free oh
group at the c17a position of the steroid dramatically reduces
the ability of the steroid to bind to the pr compared with the
corresponding substituted esters at c17a. similarly, the current
experiments with c17a-oh-containing glucocorticoids, such
as dex, bet, mo (a minor metabolite of mf) and beclo, also
showed decreased affinities towards the pr, while c17asubstituted lipophilic derivatives showed reduced selectivity.
the present results indicate that presence of a b-ch3 group, as
in bet, increased gr selectivity over dex. the difference in
the orientation of c16 methyl group between dex and bet
indicates that a methyl group in the b plane at c16 position of
the steroid might sterically hinder favourable van der waals
interaction with the surrounding hydrophobic residues at the
pr. similarly, greater gr selectivity of beclo compared with
mo could be due to the differences in the b orientation of the
c16 methyl group, but also the c21 substitute in beclo. the
effect of b-alkyl substitution on the relative receptor affinity of
steroids at the pr, as observed from the present experiment,
were in agreement with the previous observations by mcguire
et al. [18].
esterification of the c17a oh group in bmp and mf
significantly increased the pr binding affinities and contributed to an overall decrease in the gr selectivities. the current
data suggest that the furoate ester decreased gr selectivity
much more than the propionate ester (as in bmp or fp).
the increase in affinity for lipophilic 16, 17-substituted
glucocorticoids to gr has been related to the specific
interaction of these derivatives with residues of the ‘‘lipophilic

side pocket’’ of the gr [10]. the extra binding pocket present
in the gr is absent in the pr. therefore, the present authors
were somewhat surprised that with increasing size (and
lipophilicity), these derivatives showed a steeper increase in
receptor affinity towards pr than towards gr. the am1optimised structure (structure with optimised geometry) of mf
was superimposed on the receptor-bound conformation of the
original prog ligand in its receptor as determined in the
crystal structure [8]. figure 4 indicates that the c17a side chain
of mf can easily fit within the ligand-binding domain of pr,
where it is mainly surrounded by hydrophobic residues (e.g.
leu715, leu718, phe794, leu797 and tyr890). the side chain
encounters only some minimal structural hindrance from these
residues, which could easily rearrange into a more convenient
conformation as there is sufficient space and the receptor itself
is also somewhat flexible [19]. the van der waals interactions
between the lipophilic c17a ester substitution (as in mf) and
the surrounding hydrophobic residues may, therefore, result in
sufficiently favourable interactions to justify an increased
binding affinity towards the pr. possibly, a greater lipophilicity of the furoate substitution compared with the propionate
might favour greater van der waals interactions with

surrounding hydrophobic residues and a higher affinity. a
recent paper by maddaus et al. [20] confirmed that the pr can
indeed easily accommodate the larger side chain of mf and
similar drugs by shifting the hydrophobic residues (e.g. leu715,
leu718, phe794, leu797 and tyr890) outward and increasing
the binding pocket volume from 565 å3 for prog to 730 å3
for mf.
the present data indicate that reduced size and lipophilicity in
the 16, 17 region of the molecule reduces the interaction with
surrounding hydrophobic residues (e.g. leu715, leu718, phe794,
leu797 and tyr890) and reduces affinity toward pr. the

also shown as ball-and-stick structures that can provide favourable van der waals

the side chains, the hydrophilic c16a-o and c21-oh groups
experience minor hindrance from the surrounding hydrophobic residues phe905 and leu797, respectively. these unfavourable interactions at the c21 and c16a side chains might also
contribute to the worsening of the overall receptor fit of
steroids with such side chains (e.g. bud, taa) at pr, resulting
in a greater selectivity for bud compared with mf and the
propionate esters bmp and fp.
in conclusion, the present results indicate that the inhaled
glucocorticoid  xxxd2665xxx  is the least specific
followed by  xxxd294xxx -17-monopropionate, flucticasone
propionate,  xxxd3418xxx , mometasone and budesonide, which shows the highest  xxxg1601xxx  versus
 xxxg1737xxx  selectivity among inhaled corticosteroids. less lipophilic glucocorticoids, substituted in position 16
with small methyl groups (dexamethasone, betamethasone,
 xxxd294xxx ), showed higher selectivity. however, these
systemically given drugs are used at much higher concentrations and, therefore, should not represent an advantage.
systemic side-effects associated with high systemic levels are
also a major concern during high dose inhaled corticosteroid
therapy. steroids, such as  xxxd2665xxx , that show
sufficient cross-reactivity with progesterone receptors [4],
could aggravate these systemic side-effects. whether the
systemic drug concentrations achieved among patients would
be sufficient enough to identify any clinically relevant
differences in selectivity among inhaled glucocorticoids
remains to be shown in a therapeutic trial setting.
