one of the most widely distributed inhibitory neurotransmitters, and  xxxd2431xxx , an excitatory neurotransmitter (1).
the concentration of gaba is regulated by two pyridoxal 5⬘phosphate (plp)-dependent enzymes,  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase, which catalyzes the conversion of l-glutamate to
gaba, and  xxxg8xxx  ( xxxg8xxx ,  xxxg8xxx ),
which degrades gaba to succinic semialdehyde (2).  xxxg8xxx 
is a homodimer with each subunit containing an active-site
plp covalently bound to lys-329 via a schiff base. the primary
sequence of  xxxg8xxx  has been deduced from the cdna of pig
brain (3) and from peptide fragments of the pig liver enzyme
(4). together with the structurally well characterized enzymes
 xxxg1621xxx  (oat) and dialkylglycine decarboxylase (dgd),  xxxg8xxx  belongs to the subfamily ii of the
␣-family of plp-dependent enzymes (5). in 1999, the x-ray
crystal structure of pig liver  xxxg8xxx  was reported at 3.0-å
resolution (6), which elucidated the active-site geometry and
allowed conclusions to be drawn with respect to its specificity.
the mechanism for  xxxg8xxx  is well known (7). gaba is
transaminated to succinic semialdehyde, thereby converting
the pyridoxal 5⬘-phosphate (plp) cofactor to its pyridoxamine
5⬘-phosphate (pmp) form. in the reverse half-reaction the enzyme is regenerated by conversion of ␣-ketoglutarate to
glutamate.
when the concentration of gaba diminishes below a threshold level in the brain, convulsions result (8), raising the brain
gaba levels terminates the seizure (9). the incidence of seizure activity is very prevalent in the world. in fact, when
epilepsy is defined broadly as any disease characterized by
recurring convulsive seizures, then almost 1% of the entire
world population can be classified as having epilepsy (10).
consequently, anticonvulsant agents have been sought for centuries. not until  xxxd2924xxx  (dilantin) was introduced
onto the drug market over 65 years ago was any particular
anticonvulsant drug widely used (11). however, this drug is not
generally applicable. in fact, about one-quarter of epileptic
patients worldwide (about 12 million people) do not respond to
any marketed anticonvulsant drug. therefore, the need for new
anticonvulsant drugs is great (10).
a reduction in the concentrations of gaba has been implicated not only in the symptoms associated with epilepsy (12,

␥- xxxd2177xxx  aminotransferase ( xxxg8xxx ) is a
pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate-dependent enzyme responsible
for the degradation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter
gaba.  xxxg8xxx  is a validated target for antiepilepsy
drugs because its selective inhibition raises gaba concentrations in brain. the antiepilepsy drug, ␥-vinyl-gaba
(vigabatrin) has been investigated in the past by various
biochemical methods and resulted in several proposals
for its mechanisms of inactivation. in this study we solved
and compared the crystal structures of pig liver  xxxg8xxx 
in its native form (to 2.3-å resolution) and in complex with
vigabatrin as well as with the close analogue ␥-ethynylgaba (to 2.3 and 2.8 å, respectively). both inactivators
form a covalent ternary adduct with the active site lys329 and the pyridoxal 5ⴕ-phosphate (plp) cofactor. the
crystal structures provide direct support for specific inactivation mechanisms proposed earlier on the basis of radiolabeling experiments. the reactivity of  xxxg8xxx  crystals
with the two gaba analogues was also investigated by
polarized absorption microspectrophotometry. the spectral data are discussed in relation to the proposed mechanism. intriguingly, all three structures revealed a [2fe-2s]
cluster of yet unknown function at the center of the dimeric
molecule in the vicinity of the plp cofactors.

overall structure—the quality of the native  xxxg8xxx  data
(2.3 å) has been considerably improved since the previous
study (6) due to better crystal order, use of flash-cooled crystals, and data acquisition at a synchrotron radiation source.
crystallographic details are given in table i. the new structure confirms the previous model. the asymmetric unit contains two physiological dimers (ab and cd) with c2 symmetry.
the two dimers superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.23 å, and the
four subunits show pairwise r.m.s.d. values between 0.18 and
0.30 å. this indicates that, within the limits of error, there is
no structural asymmetry between the four different copies in
the crystallographic asymmetric unit. also, considering the

13) but also with several other neurological diseases such as
huntington’s chorea (14), parkinson’s disease (15), alzheimer’s
disease (16), and tardive dyskinesia (17). administration of
gaba peripherally is not effective, because gaba, under normal conditions, cannot cross the blood-brain barrier; however,
several other approaches have been taken to increase the brain
concentrations of gaba. one approach is the use of a compound that crosses the blood-brain barrier and then selectively
inhibits or inactivates  xxxg8xxx , thereby causing a buildup of
gaba. numerous competitive inhibitors of  xxxg8xxx , particularly compounds having a backbone structure similar to
gaba (18 –23), and a variety of mechanism-based inactivators
(24) of  xxxg8xxx  (25) show anticonvulsant activity. the earliest analog reported was 4-amino-5-hexynoic acid (1, ␥-ethynyl
gaba, geg), which did not become a clinical candidate (25).
the corresponding alkene,  xxxd3508xxx  (2, ␥-vinyl
gaba, vigabatrin) (26), was the most effective of these mechanism-based inactivators as an anticonvulsant agent.
vigabatrin (2), which has high potency (27), has been shown
to be an effective treatment for epilepsies that are resistant to
other anticonvulsant drugs (28) and currently is used in over 60
countries worldwide (but not in the u. s., where it is presently
at the pre-registration status for treatment of infantile
spasms). however, about 0.5 g of this drug has to be taken daily
to be efficacious. as with all psychotropic drugs, there are a
variety of side effects, most severe in this case is a visual field
defect (29), which restricts the monotherapy of vigabatrin to
refractory epilepsy. the drug is sold as a racemic mixture, and
it is not known how many of the side effects arise from the
administration of the inactive enantiomer (r-isomer). other
mechanism-based inactivators of  xxxg8xxx , such as  xxxd2169xxx  (30, 31) and ethanolamine-o-sulfate (32), are generally
toxic, nonspecific, and/or cross the blood-brain barrier poorly.
recently, it was found that vigabatrin possesses another
remarkable activity: it prevents addiction to various abusive
substances in rats and baboons (33). the mechanism was determined to be the same as that for epilepsy, namely increasing
the gaba concentration in the brain by inactivating gabaat. increased gaba levels antagonize the extracellular dopamine levels responsible for drug addiction. new inhibitors
that are in particular more potent and lipophilic, that is so they
can more easily cross the blood-brain barrier, are needed.
two mechanisms were proposed for inactivation of  xxxg8xxx 
by geg (34); these are shown in schemes 1 and 2. for inactivation by vigabatrin, three different potential mechanisms
(shown in schemes 3 and 4) were suggested, based on spectroscopic and radiolabeling evidence (35), chemical intuition (26,
36), and extensive radiochemical experiments (37). the controversy regarding the inactivation mechanisms and structures of
the covalent adducts could be settled with crystal structures of
these inactivators bound to  xxxg8xxx .
here, we have been able to use crystallography and polarized
absorption microspectrophotometry to differentiate the inactivation mechanisms and adduct structures for the two mechanism-based inactivators of  xxxg8xxx , geg (1), and vigabatrin
(2). moreover, we report the presence of a [2fe-2s] cluster at
the center of the dimer, observed in the complex structures as
well as in the native enzyme at 2.3-å resolution.

crystallography—pig liver  xxxg8xxx  was purified as described previously (35). crystals of native enzyme were grown at room temperature in sitting drops by vapor diffusion and microseeding. the protein
solution (10 –14 mg/ml in 40 mm sodium acetate, ph 5.4) was mixed in
a 1:1 ratio with precipitant solution containing 16 –18% polyethylene
glycol4000, 0 –10% glycerol, and 50 mm sodium cacodylate, ph 6.0, and
1 mm dithiothreitol.
the geg-inactivated  xxxg8xxx  crystals were obtained by overnight
soaking of native crystals in a solution containing 10 mm geg. vigabatrin-inactivated  xxxg8xxx  crystals were obtained by pre-treatment
of native  xxxg8xxx  with 10 mm vigabatrin for 1 h prior to crystallization. each data set was obtained from a single flash-cooled crystal using
either 10% ethylene glycol or panjellytm (jena bioscience) as cryoprotectants. only a few cycles of crystal annealing were performed to
improve crystal mosaicity. data were collected on mar image plates,
processed with mosflm, and scaled with scala from the ccp4 suite
(38). the models were refined with refmac5, including tls refinement (39). strong non-crystallographic symmetry restraints were imposed on the positional and thermal parameters of the four monomers
in the asymmetric unit. in the initial rounds of refinement, the cofactor
and lys-329 were set as dummy values. this was followed by cyclic
averaging using dm (40) to obtain the best unbiased map for interpretation of the adducts. after model building, refinement of the final
model was performed without torsional angle restraints on the linkages
between lys-329, cofactor, and the inhibitor moiety. planarity was
imposed on the atoms of the pyridine ring, the carboxylate group, and,
in case of the geg complex, on the atoms belonging to the planar
system of the ca⫽c double bond.
chemical analysis of iron and sulfur content—the amount of iron
bound to  xxxg8xxx  was determined colorimetrically, by using the iron
chelator ferrozine (41).  xxxg8xxx  (5–10 ␮m, 460 ␮l) was mixed with
ultrapure concentrated hcl (100 ␮l) and was incubated at 80 °c for 20
min with periodic vortexing. following centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for
5 min to pellet the denatured protein, the supernatant (510 ␮l) was
mixed with 10 mm ferrozine (20 ␮l) and 75 mm  xxxd228xxx  (20 ␮l). to
allow ferrozine chelation, the mixture was neutralized with saturated
ammonium acetate and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. the
absorbance at 562 nm of the newly formed magenta fe(ligand)32⫹ species was determined, and the iron concentration was calculated using
the extinction coefficient for ferrozine, ⑀ ⫽ 27,900 m⫺1 cm⫺1 (41). acidlabile inorganic sulfide was determined by the method of king and
morris (42).
crystal microspectrometry—crystals of  xxxg8xxx  were stored at
15 °c in a stabilizing solution containing 22% (w/v)  xxxd2982xxx 
4000, 50 mm sodium citrate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at ph 5.6. the
 xxxg8xxx  complexes were produced by soaking single crystals in the
stabilizing solution containing 100 mm geg or 10 mm vigabatrin, respectively. crystals were loaded in a quartz flow cell that was mounted
on the thermostated stage of a zeiss mpm03 microspectrophotometer,
equipped with a ⫻10 uv-visible ultrafluar objective. single crystal
absorption spectra were collected in the range 300 –700 nm with the
electric vector of the linearly polarized light parallel and perpendicular
to the extinction directions, as previously described (43, 44). the isotropic crystal spectrum ai of  xxxg8xxx  was calculated according to ai ⫽
1/3(ax ⫹ ay ⫹ az), where ax, ay, and az are the spectra recorded along
the three perpendicular extinction directions (45).
coordinates—the coordinates for native  xxxg8xxx , and its complex
structures with geg and vigabatrin, have been deposited in the rutgers protein data bank (accession codes 1ohv, 1ohy, and 1ohw,
respectively).

good quality of the overall crystallographic parameters (table
i), it appears unlikely that asymmetric dimers have been incorporated stochastically into the crystal lattice. refinement of
global temperature factors (tls refinement), however, revealed that ab is the more mobile dimer within the crystal
lattice. after tls refinement, the remaining (intrinsic) b-factors of the subunits were virtually identical. this allowed the
imposition of strong ncs constraints not only on the positional
parameters but also on the individual b-factors.
the native cofactor: structure and absorption spectrum—
all four copies of the plp cofactor in the asymmetric unit form
a schiff base linkage with lys-329 (fig. 1) and exhibit similar
b-factors (between 15 and 20 å2) after tls refinement. with a
torsional angle ␬ (for torsion angle definition and atom nomenclature see fig. 4c) of 23° ⫾ 3° the schiff’s base nitrogen is
roughly in the plane of the pyridine ring and forms a short
h-bond with the pyridine oxygen (o3) indicative of a protonated aldimine. the torsional angle around the formal c4⬘⫽n
double bond is 140° ⫾ 2°. thus, the conformation appears to be
rather strained.
single crystal polarized absorption spectra of  xxxg8xxx , recorded along three perpendicular directions (fig. 2), exhibit an
intense band centered at 412 nm. this band is usually attrib-

uted to the ketoenamine tautomer of the protonated internal
aldimine (i.e. with the proton on the aldimine nitrogen). however, there is a second band centered between 333 and 338 nm.
a band at a similar position has been found in several plp-dependent enzymes (43, 46) and has been attributed to the enolimine tautomer of the internal aldimine (with the proton on
the pyridine oxygen), a species stabilized by a more hydrophobic environment (47). noteworthy, the position of the minor
band changes with the polarization direction, which suggests
that this band does not originate from a single electronic transition, but results from overlapping bands. the reconstructed
isotropic spectrum of the crystal (fig. 2, inset) is similar to the
spectrum of the enzyme in solution (35) with respect to both the
peak positions and relative intensities, indicating that crystallization did not perturb the coenzyme environment or the tautomeric equilibrium.
[2fe-2s] cluster—unexpectedly, a [2fe-2s] cluster was
identified on the molecular 2-fold symmetry axis at the center
of the dimer in all structures investigated (fig. 3, a and b).
previously, it was not possible to resolve this feature because of
poor resolution (3 å) (6). fig. 3b shows that cysteines 135 and
138 at the n-terminal end of helix 5 together with their symmetry related mates chelate the cluster. each of the iron atoms

is coordinated tetrahedrally by two cysteines of one subunit
and the two free sulfur atoms, which lie on the molecular 2-fold
axis and cross-link to the symmetry related second iron atom.
the fe–s distances are 2.2–2.3 å. the b-factors of the cluster
atoms and the cysteines match well (differences ⬍ 4 å2).
a 2.3-å anomalous difference density map computed with
data collected at a wavelength of 0.98 å (vigabatrin complex,
cluster atoms omitted for phasing) shows peaks with a height ⬎
5 ␴ (fig. 3c). the peaks are even more pronounced (⬎8 ␴) in a
map computed with data collected to the same resolution with
cuk␣ radiation at a home source (data not shown). this is to be
expected for iron with its absorption edge at 1.7 å and rules out
the presence of zinc or other lighter elements.

chemical analysis of the iron and acid-labile sulfide content
of freshly purified  xxxg8xxx  corroborated the crystallographic
interpretation. in four independent experiments, a content of
0.9 –1.2 iron atoms per enzyme subunit was determined. the
sulfide content was 0.8 and 0.9 (two experiments). in proteins,
[2fe-2s] clusters typically show absorption in the visible range
of the spectrum with peaks around 330 nm, 420 – 460 nm, and
a broad shoulder centered at 550 nm (48). thus, in  xxxg8xxx ,
any iron-sulfur cluster absorption will be largely concealed by
the cofactor. a shoulder around 550 – 600 nm, however, is
clearly visible in the crystal absorption spectrum (fig. 2) as in
solution (49). this is absent in the homologous oat (49) that
contains no fes cluster.

fig. 1. stereographic projection of
the active site of  xxxg8xxx . the final
model is shown together with the 2fo ⫺ fc
map (contour level, 1.2 ␴). an acetate molecule is found close to arg-192, i.e. at a
position where the carboxylate moiety of
the natural substrate gaba is expected
to bind (6).

 xxxg8xxx  in complex with geg—the electron density map
of  xxxg8xxx  obtained upon soaking of crystals with geg,
clearly shows a covalent modification at the active site (fig.
4a). the internal aldimine linkage between lys-329 and plp of
the native enzyme (fig. 1) has been broken. instead, a covalent
ternary adduct is formed among the cofactor, the inhibitor, and
the lysine residue. fig. 4c demonstrates that the pyridine ring
is only slightly tilted (about 5°) with respect to its native
orientation. in accord with this, phe-189 has moved by 0.6 å.
as anticipated earlier (6), the carboxylate group of the inhibitor
forms a salt bridge with the guanidinium group of arg-192,
which is found pushed outwards by 0.7 å when compared with
the native enzyme.
the density shows that the distance between the two nitrogens (nz and n) of the plp-lysine linkage is spanned by three
and not four bonds, thus indicating that the reaction has proceeded according to the mechanism depicted in scheme 2 and
not by the mechanism in scheme 1. in fact, the map was best
modeled with tautomer 10 of scheme 2 (fig. 4a), yielding a flat
residual difference map. missing density for the branching c⬘
atom in the unbiased map is probably the result of its modest
resolution (2.8 å) or some heterogeneity, i.e. the presence of
some of the other tautomers shown in scheme 2 (see “discussion”). the distance of the branching methyl group to the ile-72
side chain is rather short ranging from 3.0 to 3.3 å in the
individual active sites. the plane of the pyridine ring is roughly

perpendicular to the plane defined by the ca⫽c double bond.
the (unconstrained) c4 –c4⬘–n–ca torsional angle around the
formal c4⬘⫽n double bond is 155°. both nitrogen atoms of the
linkage (n and nz) are in h-bonding distance to the pyridine o3.
the reaction of geg with  xxxg8xxx  crystals was monitored
by measuring polarized absorption spectra as a function of
crystal-soaking time (fig. 5a). a slow decrease of the band at
412 nm was observed with a concomitant increase of the band
at 337 nm with an isosbestic point at about 370 nm, indicating
the formation of an inhibitor䡠enzyme complex. the complex
was found to be very stable (fig. 5a, inset), as observed in
solution,2 suggesting an irreversible covalent linkage between
geg and the enzyme.
 xxxg8xxx  in complex with vigabatrin—soaking of
 xxxg8xxx  crystals in vigabatrin solution did not yield interpretable electron density for the adduct (see also below). cocrystallization, however, yielded the structure depicted in fig.
4b. again, a ternary adduct among lys-329, the cofactor, and
the inhibitor has formed, but this time the electron density
indicates the presence of four bonds joining n with nz. therefore, it can be ruled out that intermediates of the alternative
michael addition pathway and the enamine pathway (scheme
4) are present in significant amounts. instead, a model of the

arg-192, probably representing the carboxylate group of the
inhibitor. addition of ␣-ketoglutarate did not alter the results
significantly.
discussion

external aldimine 15 that can occur after michael addition at
the terminal carbon of the vinyl group by the active site lysine
(scheme 3) fits the electron density best and yields a flat
difference map. the adduct model is well accommodated in the
active site of the enzyme with the nz amino group forming an
h-bond with the main-chain carbonyl of residue 72 and the
aldimine nh, which lies in the plane of the pyridine ring
forming an h-bond with o3. the adduct appears to be in a
rather relaxed conformation with an (unconstrained) torsion
angle around the c4⬘–n aldimine linkage of ⫺169°.
to monitor the kinetics of the reaction in the crystal, polarized absorption spectra were acquired of  xxxg8xxx  crystals
that were soaked in a vigabatrin solution (fig. 5b). a gradual
decrease in the band at 412 nm with a concomitant increase of
the band at 337 nm was observed with an isosbestic point at
365 nm. the spectral changes were complete in about 3 h (fig.
5b, inset). at longer times, a decrease of both band intensities
was apparent, whereas their intensity ratio remained constant,
probably indicating release of a modified cofactor from the
crystal. the reaction appears to be irreversible, because the
removal of the reagent after 9 h of incubation did not lead to a
reversal of the spectral changes. when the reaction of the
enzyme with vigabatrin is carried out in the presence of 10 mm
␣-ketoglutarate (to convert any pmp form back to the competent plp form), the same spectral changes were observed,
although at a slower rate (data not shown).
an attempt was made to follow these changes structurally by
incubating  xxxg8xxx  crystals for a defined length of time before flash cooling and data acquisition. several data sets were
collected after incubation with vigabatrin for 3–24 h (data not
shown). in all cases it was evident that a reaction had occurred
as judged by the absence of a covalent aldimine linkage between c4⬘ of the cofactor and nz of lys-329 due to a motion of
the tip of the lysine side-chain and a slight though significant
tilt of the cofactor ring. coarse modeling gave a c4⬘ to nz
distance of 2.5–3 å, somewhat smaller than the corresponding
distance (4.0 å) in the vigabatrin co-crystallization complex

the [2fe-2s] cluster—an unexpected finding of the current
study is the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster at the center of
the  xxxg8xxx  dimer that is clearly resolved (fig. 3). the presence of metals in mammalian  xxxg8xxx , although suspected,
was never reported in previous biochemical studies. the complexity of the visible absorption spectrum of  xxxg8xxx  was
initially assigned to anomalous binding of plp (50). iron-sulfur
clusters are well known in enzymology for their important
functions in electron transfer processes, but they also are now
known to catalyze dehydration reactions, to stabilize protein
structure, to regulate metabolic pathways, to act as biological
sensors of iron, molecular oxygen, and superoxide,  xxxd2738xxx 
and are involved in the formation of protein-bound radicals
(51). in  xxxg8xxx  the [2fe-2s] cluster cross-links the subunits
of the physiological dimer. it appears unlikely that this is its
only role, because structurally homologous proteins such as
human oat (52) and bacterial dgd (53) exhibit the same
subunit organization, but lack a cross-linker at the dimer interface. the same is true for all other aminotransferases of
known structure. to the best of our knowledge, there are no
other iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes that have a cluster exclusively for subunit cross-linking. iron-sulfur clusters
can be destroyed by oxidation (for a review see ref. 54) and can
exert in this way a redox state sensing function. because the
iron-sulfur cluster of  xxxg8xxx  is observed without resorting to
anaerobic conditions, its stability does not seem to be exquisitely sensitive to oxidation.
interestingly, cysteines 135 and 138, which chelate the cluster, are conserved in the  xxxg8xxx  sequences of higher organisms, including drosophila, but are not present in bacteria
and yeast, with the exception of the basidiomycete ustilago
maydis. it is conceivable that during biogenesis the iron-sulfur
cluster is needed for the proper association of  xxxg8xxx  subunits to form the functional dimer. this then may happen only
in the strongly reducing environment of the mitochondria and
would ensure that the enzyme becomes active only at its
destination.
alternatively, the redox state of the cluster may regulate
indirectly the activity of the enzyme as suggested by the relatively short distance between the cluster and the two active
sites (fig. 3b). most interestingly, a direct influence of nitric
oxide (which is known to modulate the redox state of ironsulfur clusters) on  xxxg8xxx  activity in rat brains has recently
been reported (55). the presence of an iron-sulfur cluster in
plp enzymes has been recently observed in biotin synthase
(56) and lysine 2,3-aminomutase (57). in these cases, the ironsulfur cluster is directly involved in catalysis, which is not the
case for  xxxg8xxx . clearly, in vitro studies have to be performed to characterize and to clarify the role of the [2fe-2s]
cluster in mammalian  xxxg8xxx .
native structure and cofactor spectrum—in the native enzyme, the plp cofactor is bound to lys-329 via a schiff base
linkage, and there is no evidence for a structural asymmetry
between the active sites of the dimer as previously reported
(50). the short distance between the aldimine n and the pyridine o3⬘ indicates that the cofactor is protonated. the aldimine
linkage appears strained, because the conjugated systems of
the cofactor ring and the linkage are not coplanar (with the
aldimine n having a distance of 0.6 å to the cofactor plane, fig.
1). this strained conformation is observed in several plp enzymes, e.g. in tryptophan synthase (58) (pdb code 1qop, struc-

to catalysis by raising the ground state energy of the aldimine

it is known that the  xxxg8xxx  cofactor does not titrate
between ph 5.5 and 9 (60), i.e. the aldimine n has a pka above
9. in aspartate aminotransferase (aat), which titrates in the

neutral ph range, the deprotonated aldimine double bond is
rotated out of the ring plane (␬ about 80° (61)). a similar
rotation is prevented by the presence of val-300 (which corresponds to ala-224 in aat), and this may explain the high pka
value of the cofactor. the absence of an equivalent of aat

on the pyridine o3 in aat, offers another possible explanation.
the visible absorption spectrum (fig. 2) shows two peaks as
have also been observed for the plp forms of aat at low ph
(62) and of tryptophan synthase (43). these can tentatively be
assigned to the protonated aldimine in the ketoenamine
(␭max ⫽ 412 nm) and enolimine (␭max ⬃ 335 nm) form. another
interpretation would be that the non-coplanarity of the plp
ring and the aldimine linkage can cause the occurrence of two

electronic transitions for the ketoenamine form, as has been
demonstrated by clark et al. (62). their semiempirical calculations showed that the positions of the absorption bands vary
with the torsional angle ␬ and can fall in a range that is
observed for  xxxg8xxx  (and other plp enzymes). in the crystal
spectrum (fig. 2), the polarization ratios differ for the two
bands, which is consistent with a different orientation of the
coenzyme in the ketoenamine and enolimine tautomers and/or

crystal structures of inactivated  xxxg8xxx 

different directions of the dipole transition moments. the variability of the position of the peak assigned to the enolimine
tautomer with polarization direction suggests that this band
does not originate from a single electronic transition. whether
this results from a contribution of the iron-sulfur cluster has
yet to be investigated.
inactivation by geg—this study is part of a project to unravel the structure and function of  xxxg8xxx  for the development of inhibitory drugs to control gaba levels in the brain. a
first result in this direction has been published recently (63).
geg (1), one of the first rationally designed mechanism-based
inactivators, was shown to be a potent inactivator of  xxxg8xxx 
(30, 64, 65). in vivo, geg causes a long-lasting decrease in
mouse brain  xxxg8xxx  activity in a dose-dependent manner
when administered peripherally and has been shown to increase synaptosomal gaba levels (66, 67).
two inactivation mechanisms for geg have been reported
(34). in scheme 1, following schiff base formation with the
active site plp, ␥-(ca)-proton removal and tautomerization
into the cofactor gives the ␣,␤-ethynyliminium complex (5), a
highly electrophilic species, which would undergo reaction at
the terminal carbon atom of the ethynyl group (36) with lys329. scheme 2 is similar to scheme 1 except after ␥-(ca)-proton
removal, tautomerization occurs with the ethynyl group to give
6, a conjugated allene, which can undergo reaction at the penultimate carbon with the active site lysine residue (34, 36, 64)
(at the time of publication it was not known that the nucleophile is lys-329, as shown in schemes 1 and 2).

these two mechanisms, which differ in the point of attachment of lys-329 to the inactivator, have now been differentiated by crystallography (fig. 4a). lys-329 was found to be
attached to the penultimate carbon, thereby supporting the
overall mechanism in scheme 2. attack of 6 by lys-329 can
lead to four different tautomers (7-10). following inactivation
of [7-3h]plp-reconstituted  xxxg8xxx  by geg and denaturation, plp was released, which is consistent only with 7, 9,
and 10 (34).
on steric grounds, as well as the [7-3h]plp experiment
described above, structure 8 is highly unlikely, because it is not
possible to bring the c4⬘ of the coenzyme into the plane defined
by the ketimine double bond. modeling of the remaining tautomers (7, 9, and 10) and subsequent refinement yielded comparable fits with the density. the well defined positions of the
plp cofactor, the lysine side chain, and the inhibitor cofactor
(fig. 4a) impose strong constraints on the geometry of the
linkage. for adducts 7 and 9, the distance between nz and c4⬘
is 2.1–2.4 å (depending on the subunit), which is unreasonably
close. this distance is increased to 2.5–2.6 å for adduct 10.
although still rather strained, this tautomer clearly represents
the best fit of the structural data. credence to this interpretation is given also by the close to planar torsional angle around
the aldimine double bond. the crystal structure, therefore,
clearly confirms the mechanism proposed based on radiolabeling experiments (34). the crystal absorption spectrum of
 xxxg8xxx  after incubation with geg (fig. 5a) shows the two
bands of the native spectrum (fig. 2), although with a change
in relative height. thus, the spectrum is compatible with the
aldimine 10, with a shifted ketoenamine/enolimine equilibrium
compared with the native structure. the ca⫽cb double bond
probably does not contribute to the visible spectrum, because
its orientation is roughly perpendicular to the pyridine plane.
the presence of other ternary adducts of scheme 2, however,
cannot be ruled out. the reaction proceeds more slowly than
that with vigabatrin (see below), leading to the formation of a
stable complex, as observed in solution. this is consistent with
the observed covalent link between the inhibitor, the plp, and
the protein.
inactivation by vigabatrin—three different inactivation
mechanisms for  xxxg8xxx  by vigabatrin (2) have been reported
(schemes 3 and 4). one mechanism (scheme 3) involves azallylic isomerization followed by ␥-proton removal as in the normal catalytic mechanism with substrate. unlike gaba, vigabatrin is converted into an electrophilic species (12), which
could undergo michael addition at the terminal carbon of the
vinyl group by the active site lys-329 to give 13. adduct 13 can
easily be tautomerized to 14 or 15. an alternative michael
addition pathway (scheme 4) requires allylic isomerization
through the vinyl double bond to give 16, which also is a
michael acceptor. this can be attacked by lys-329 to give
attachment of the nucleophile at the penultimate carbon of the
former vinyl group to yield 17 and 18 (path a). or, alternatively, lys-329 can attack the plp imine carbon rather than
undergoing michael addition, leading to enamine 19, which can
condense with the plp imine to give adduct 20 (path b).
lippert et al. (26) proposed the mechanism in scheme 3 up to
intermediate 13. metcalf (36) suggested two possibilities:
scheme 3 up to intermediate 13 and the mechanism in scheme
4 to give 17. on the basis of [14c]vigabatrin labeling experiments and mass spectrometry on the radiolabeled peptide, de
biase et al. (35) ruled out the enamine mechanism (scheme 4,
path b), because no coenzyme was detected in the peptideinhibitor adduct. they suggested that their data were consistent with the formation of either 14 or 17. nanavati and silverman (37) used [7-3h]plp-reconstituted  xxxg8xxx  and

crystal structures of inactivated  xxxg8xxx 
in summary, we have obtained high resolution crystal structures of  xxxg8xxx  inactivated by geg and vigabatrin. each of
these structures has clarified the products of inactivation,
which then allowed for the elucidation of the major mechanisms of inactivation. this approach does not require the tedious and time-consuming synthesis of radiolabeled compounds
and structure elucidation by peptide mapping. although peptide mapping and mass spectrometry are important tools to
identify sites of modification, they do not provide precise adduct structure information of crystallography needed to aid in
the elucidation of reasonable inactivation mechanisms. however, as a note of caution, had the inactivation mechanism for
vigabatrin been based solely on the crystal structure, the minor
enamine inactivation pathway would have been overlooked.
the adduct structures described here will serve as a starting
point for the development of mechanism-based inactivators and
reversible inhibitors to target specifically  xxxg8xxx . the
native structure has already led to the design of a vigabatrin analog that is converted exclusively by the enamine
mechanism (63).

[6-14c]vigabatrin and showed that denaturation of the inactivated enzyme releases pmp and the enamine adduct from 20 in
a 75:25 ratio, thereby supporting the enamine mechanism as a
minor pathway and either 14 (scheme 3) or 17 (scheme 4), both
of which would release pmp upon denaturation, as the major
pathway. further studies on the reactivity and reactions of the
major adduct (37) led to the conclusion that 14 was the actual
inactivation adduct.
the crystal structure of vigabatrin bound to  xxxg8xxx  (fig.
4, b and c) elucidates the structure of the covalent adduct as
one in which lys-329 is attached to the terminal carbon of the
vinyl group as proposed in scheme 3, effectively ruling out the
mechanisms shown in scheme 4. it is not possible to differentiate between the ternary adducts 13-15 based on the electron
density (fig. 4b) alone, and there may be even more than one
tautomer present in the crystal. the geometry appears most
relaxed for tautomer 15 with an (unconstrained) torsion angle
around the n–ca aldimine linkage of ⫺169° and a ␬ torsion
angle of 1° resulting in coplanarity of the aldimine linkage with
the pyridine ring and a favorable h-bond between the ionized
nh⫹ and o3⫺. structure 15 is not consistent with the biochemical result that after denaturation pmp is formed; instead the
release of plp would be predicted. tautomerization from 15 to
14, however, would lead to the observed release of pmp under
the conditions of the denaturation, but it is not clear why that
tautomerization should occur.
the crystal spectrum of  xxxg8xxx  after treatment with vigabatrin (fig. 5b) is compatible with the presence of the less
conjugated system of ketimine 14, the aldimine 15 with a
shifted ketoenamine/enolimine equilibrium, the aldimine species 12, or species 11. because the cofactor is gradually released from the crystal (fig. 5b, inset), one can conclude that
there is no covalent linkage between the cofactor and the protein, which is in disagreement with the crystal structure. apparently, the different ways the vigabatrin complex had to be
produced for structure determination (complex formation in
solution and subsequent crystallization) and for spectroscopic
analysis (crystal soaking) are relevant for resolving this issue.
we suggest that, in the soaked crystal, the reaction does not
progress efficiently beyond the formation of the external aldimine (12), which would be the species that gets released with
time. the next step (scheme 3) would require rotation of the
vinyl group toward the active site lysine, which may well be
hindered by a reduced conformational flexibility of the active
site due to crystal lattice constraints. for the reaction with
geg, such a conformational change is not required, and the
reaction can proceed to form a stable ternary complex. overall,
these findings point out that crystalline proteins might not
behave as in the soluble form, because small, but functionally
essential conformational changes may be prevented or the
equilibrium distribution of species may be perturbed, causing
unanticipated reactivity (44, 68).
why is only the michael addition adduct (14) observed in the
vigabatrin structure and not the enamine adduct (20)? possibly, the michael addition complex is thermodynamically more
stable than the enamine adduct, which would thus have been
lost over the time needed for crystallization. as a result, a
partially occupied michael complex would be left in the crystal.
indeed, test refinement of the model with a partially occupied
adduct showed that the occupancy can be set as low as 75%
without getting unreasonable b-values. this is consistent with
the 75:25 ratio of michael addition to enamine addition adducts
previously observed (37). alternatively, a small fraction of active sites containing the enamine adduct (20) would not contribute significantly to the observed density (which is the average over all active sites).
