central pain syndrome (cps) is defined as pain associated with a lesion of the cns and is a common consequence of spinal cord injuries.
we generated a rodent model of cps by making unilateral electrolytic or demyelinating lesions centered on the spinothalamic tract in
rats. thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia occurred in both hind paws and forepaws by 7 d postlesion and were maintained
⬎31 d. field potentials in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (vpl) in thalamic brain slices from lesioned animals displayed an
increased probability of burst responses.  xxxd2056xxx , a t-type calcium channel blocker, eliminated busting in lesioned thalamic slices
and attenuated lesion-induced hyperalgesia and allodynia. we conclude that cps in this model results from an increase in the excitability
of thalamic nuclei that have lost normal ascending inputs as the result of a spinal cord injury and suggest that  xxxd2056xxx  will relieve
human cps by restoring normal thalamic excitability.

introduction
central pain syndrome (cps) is defined as pain resulting from a
lesion or pathology of the cns. the majority of patients with cps
have suffered a spinal cord injury, and as many as 80% of spinal
injury patients go on to develop cps (bonica, 1991; yezierski,
2000; cannavero and bonicalzi, 2007), including some with complete transection. cps is also a significant complication for almost half of patients with multiple sclerosis (bonica, 1991), particularly those with spinal involvement. stroke survivors also
develop cps, typically if the thalamus is affected. the cause of
cps remains unknown.
cps patients experience severe and excruciating pain originating from areas in and around the primary sensory loss produced by the lesion (tasker et al., 1992). many patients also suffer
from allodynia, a perception that a normally nonpainful stimulus
is painful, and hyperalgesia, an increased sensitivity to weakly
painful stimuli (greenspan et al., 2004). the onset of cps is
usually delayed weeks or months from the original injury (tasker
et al., 1991). cps patients are highly resistant to opioid analgesia
and other pharmaceutical or surgical therapies. the severity of
the pain and the lack of effective treatments are demonstrated by

the very high incidence of suicide among cps sufferers (gonzales, 1995).
cps has long been thought to originate in the thalamus (dejerine and roussy, 1906). electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that the behavior of thalamic cells and circuits is pathologically altered in cps. in human cps patients, the receptive
fields of thalamic relay cells in the ventral posterior lateral thalamus (vpl) are absent in regions representing the areas of sensory
loss, but are greatly expanded in nearby regions or remapped to
distant and unexpected body surfaces (lenz et al., 1987, 1989).
sensory modalities are also reorganized such that a weak peripheral stimulus that would normally produce a thermal sensation
now induces pain (lenz et al., 1998). eeg recordings reveal a
slowing of normal thalamic rhythms (gücer et al., 1978), not
unlike the altered eeg seen in childhood absence epilepsy. more
strikingly, whereas neurons in the vpl display regular 10 hz
action potential discharge in non-cps patients, neurons in cps
patients fire brief bursts of high frequency action potentials (lenz
et al., 1987, 1989; jeanmonod et al., 1993). this abnormal burst
discharge is particularly prominent in regions corresponding to
the parts of the patient’s body with pain and loss of sensation.
finally, weak microstimulation in the thalamus is capable of eliciting painful sensations in cps patients, particularly when the
stimulation is delivered in regions in which excessive bursting is
observed, but not in non-cps patients (lenz et al., 1987, 1998;
davis et al., 1996; dostrovsky, 2000).
we produced lesions of the ventrolateral spinal white matter
centered on the spinothalamic tract (stt), demonstrated pain
hypersensitivity, and used this model to test the hypothesis that
partial deafferentation of relay cells in the vpl, and subsequently
a delayed increase in their excitability, accounts for the altered

pain sensation. in addition, we tested the
hypothesis that  xxxd2056xxx , an antiepileptic drug used successfully to treat childhood absence epilepsy, would restore normal thalamic excitability and alleviate the
altered pain sensation in these rats.

guidelines for use of experimental animals published by the international association for the
study of pain. rats were kept on a 12 h light/
dark cycle, housed 2–3/cage, and received food
and water ad libitum. a total of 200 animals
were used for all experiments: 102 for behavior,
52 for electrophysiology, 46 for anterograde labeling and degeneration visualization.

in some cases (8 rats) two lesion sites were
made at 0.6 mm lateral, 1.8 mm deep and 0.8

sion (fig. 2 a, b). for all paws, the hyperalgesia persisted for ⬎31
d after the lesion.
we next assayed nociception using a graded series of mechanical
forces delivered to the dorsal surface of the hind and forepaws with
von frey’s filaments. for each paw, we prepared a stimulus-response
function with the frequency of paw withdrawal plotted as a function
of the force used. data were fit with a sigmoid function, and the
threshold paw withdrawal force was defined as the force necessary to
produce paw withdrawal in 50% of trials, according to the fit. in
sham control animals, there was a small and transient decrease in the
threshold withdrawal force for both hind and forepaws at 3 d postsurgery that recovered to control values by 7 d after the surgery. in
lesioned animals in contrast, we observed that ⬃80% less force was
required to induce paw withdrawal for both ipsilateral and contralateral hind and forepaws, apparent as a leftward shift in the stimulusresponse curves, by ⬎3 d postlesion (fig. 2c,d). withdrawal thresholds remained decreased for ⬎31 d after the lesion (fig. 2e,f). we
conclude that a physical transaction of the spinothalamic tract induces the delayed development of chronic alterations in objective
pain sensation in rats.
demyelinating lesions of the spinothalamic tract alter
pain perception
cps is also a complication of many demyelinating diseases, such
as transverse myelitis (bonica, 1991; cannavero and bonicalzi,
2007). to determine whether only physical interruption of spinothalamic tract axons can alter pain sensation, we triggered an
autoimmune demyelinating lesion of the spinothalamic tract and
action potential conduction failures by injecting lysophosphatidylcholine (lpc) into the right ventrolateral thoracic spinal cord
(t8 or t9 level) (foster et al., 1980). lpc injection induced longlasting demyelination in spinothalamic tract, as apparent from
the loss of normal dark-staining myelin (fig. 1 b). neurofilaments in the demyelination site remained intact (fig. 1 b), however, indicating that the injection did not physically damage the
spinothalamic tract axons themselves. as with the electrolytic
lesions, demyelinating spinothalamic tract lesions (msttx) resulted in both mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and allodynia bilaterally in both hind paws and forepaws, beginning three
to 14 d postlesion and lasting for ⬎31 d (fig. 3). we conclude that
altered input activity, rather than an interruption in the spinothalamic connection per se, is sufficient to alter pain sensation
chronically.
unilateral spinothalamic tract lesions induce subjective
pain behavior
thermal and mechanically induced responses provide objective
measures of pain sensation in response to acute stimuli. we next
wished to determine whether the lesioned rats experienced ongoing, spontaneous subjective pain. we therefore examined spontaneous locomotor activity with an open field test (hasnie et al., 2007;
suzuki et al., 2007). rats in which the spinothalamic tract had been
electrolytically lesioned 14 d earlier displayed 57% less spontaneous
locomotion in the outer quadrants of an open field arena than sham
operated control rats (fig. 4a). this difference could not be attributed to locomotor deficits, because lesioned rats displayed no change
in walking or rearing behavior, such as limping, foot dragging or
uneven gait, nor did it result from anxiety, because there was no
significant difference in the fraction of the crossings made by the
lesioned and sham-operated animals from outer to inner quadrants
(fig. 4b).
we conclude that interruption of the normal ascending activity carried by the spinothalamic tract leads to altered pain sensa-

tion, characterized by hypersensitivity, and reduced spontaneous
locomotor activity. these changes were bilateral, occurred only
after a delay of several days, and persisted for many weeks. these
features resemble the allodynia and hyperalgesia experienced by
humans suffering from central pain syndrome after spinal cord
injury, suggesting that it may provide useful insights into the
underlying biological mechanisms.
spinothalamic tract lesions induce burst discharges in the
vpl nucleus of the thalamus
we hypothesized that altered pain sensation might result from
alterations in neuronal excitability in either neuronal populations in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, giving rise to untransected ascending projections, or in the target neurons of the
lesioned spinothalamic tract axons in the vpl thalamus. furthermore, we predicted that if the intrinsic firing behavior of either
population of cells was altered in response to lesions centered on
the spinothalamic tract, then the pathological activity would be
maintained in acutely prepared brain slices. we therefore recorded extracellular field potentials, to sample activity from a
population of cells near the recording electrode, in the contralat-

⬃100 –200 ␮m from the recording electrode were characterized
by one or two negative-going deflections of 2– 4 ms in duration at
a latency of 3–5 ms from the stimulus, consistent with the discharge of one or two action potentials in nearby neurons. field
potentials in slices taken from lesioned animals, however, displayed numerous negative deflections at intervals of 10 –20 ms,
consistent with the discharge of bursts of action potentials at high

frequency in the partially denervated vpl
neurons (fig. 5a). bursting responses (⬎1
population spike) were elicited in 68% of
slices from lesioned animals, but only 28%
and 25% of slices from sham and intact
animals (␹ 2 ⫽ 8.86, p ⬍ 0.05; n ⫽ 12 lesioned, 5 sham, 5 intact). for those slices
displaying bursts, there was a significantly
higher average number of population
spikes per trial in lesioned slices than in
slices from sham or intact animals (fig.
5b). we quantified the degree of bursting
activity using a modified version of the
coastline index (korn et al., 1987) and observed a three-fold increase in slices from
lesioned animals (fig. 5c). similar bursting discharges were observed in the vpl in
contralateral thalamic slices (n ⫽ 3), but
not in the ipsilateral medial geniculate nucleus (n ⫽ 2). there was no difference in the
amplitude of the first field potential between
slices from lesioned, sham, and intact animals, indicating that the intensity of stimulation was comparable in all experiments
(fig. 5d). we conclude that neurons in the
vpl exhibit hyperexcitability after spinothalamic tract lesion that is strikingly similar to
the altered discharge displayed by neurons in
the thalamus of human patients with central
pain syndromes (lenz et al., 1987, 1989;
jeanmonod et al., 1993). this altered excitability is intrinsic to the vpl because it is
apparent in acutely isolated brain slices.
in spinal cord slices from lumbar levels,
in contrast, field potentials recorded in
laminas iii-v in response to single stimuli
delivered at the dorsal root entry zone displayed single negative going deflections of
2–3 ms in duration at a latency of 2–3 ms
after stimulation, consistent with the firing
of single action potentials by neurons in
the vicinity of the recording electrode. in
all cases, the field potentials were eliminated by the ampa-type  xxxg981xxx  antagonist  xxxd1918xxx  (40 ␮m), indicating
that they were the result of monosynaptic
glutamatergic excitation (fig. 5e). there
was no significant difference in the amplitude of these field potentials in slices taken
from lesioned, sham or intact animals (fig.
5f ).

and are known to underlie bursting discharge in these neurons
during sleep spindles and spike-and-wave discharges of childhood absence epilepsy (mccormick and bal, 1997; crunelli and
leresche, 2002; steriade, 2005). we therefore tested the hypothesis that the irregular bursts observed in vpl neurons after spinothalamic tract lesions also require t-type calcium channels for

their generation. we applied the widely
used anti-absence epilepsy drug  xxxd2056xxx , which is known to be a selective
blocker of t-type calcium channels
(coulter et al., 1989). we observed that
burst firing was abolished when  xxxd2056xxx  (0.7 mm) was applied to slices from
lesioned animals, apparent as a 36 ⫾ 3%
decrease in the coastline index (fig. 6 a, b),
so that responses in slices from lesioned
animals were identical to those in slices
from intact or sham operated control animals. in slices from control and sham operated rats, in contrast,  xxxd2056xxx  had
no significant effect on the coastline index.
 xxxd2056xxx  had no effect on the amplitude of the first population spike in slices
from control, sham or lesioned rats (fig.
6c). furthermore,  xxxd2056xxx  had no
effect on the amplitude of field potentials
in laminas iii-v of spinal cord slices from
control, sham or lesioned animals (fig.
5e). we conclude that bursting discharges
in thalamic neurons experiencing chronic
partial denervation after spinothalamic
tract lesions require the participation of
t-type voltage-dependent calcium channels and that  xxxd2056xxx  can be used to
restore normal physiological responses to
the denervated cells.
 xxxd2056xxx  alleviates lesion-induced
hyperalgesia and allodynia
because  xxxd2056xxx  alleviated the hyperexcitability of the thalamic neurons in
lesioned animals, without affecting spinal
cord responses, we next tested the hypothesis that this thalamic bursting activity underlies the altered pain sensation in these
animals. we therefore determined the effects of an intraperitoneal injection of
 xxxd2056xxx  at a range of concentrations
on paw withdrawal in response to thermal figure 7. a– e,  xxxd2056xxx  eliminates hyperalgesia and allodynia induced by spinothalamic tract lesion. contralateral hind

too,  xxxd2056xxx  (50 mg/kg) restored the level of locomotor
activity displayed by the lesioned rats to levels that were not different from sham controls (fig. 4 a), but did not effect on the
percentage of crossings into the inner zone (fig. 4 b). the ability
of  xxxd2056xxx  to reduce both pathological thalamic bursting
activity and allodynia and hyperalgesia in animals subjected to
spinothalamic tract lesions leads us to conclude that altered pain
sensation after spinal cord injury results from a lesion-induced
hyperexcitability of thalamic neurons.

discussion
this study was designed to develop a rat model of central pain
syndrome to reveal the biological bases of the condition, and
to test novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cps.
the pain experienced by cps patients is varied, but the most
typical symptoms are hyperalgesia for evoked pain and allodynia, and this hyperesthesia is always delayed in onset

j. neurosci., november 12, 2008 • 28(46):11959 –11969 • 11967

(nasreddine and saver, 1997; finnerup et al., 2004). we have
observed several forms of altered pain sensation after unilateral lesions involving the ascending spinothalamic tract in
rats, confirming previous observations in cats and primates
(vierck et al., 1990; koyama et al., 1993; weng et al., 2003).
spinal cord injury in rats induced hypersensitivity to thermal
and mechanical stimuli delivered bilaterally at both aboveand below-level sites, as well as a decrease in spontaneous
locomotor activity in a novel environment. changes in painrelated behaviors were apparent as early  xxxd79xxx   xxxd1710xxx  d after the injury
and persisted for longer than 1 month. furthermore, heightened pain sensitivity resulted from both electrolytic lesions, in
which the ascending stt axons degenerate, and demyelinating lesions, in which the axons remain intact but their information transmitting properties are impaired.
there is considerable evidence that cats, primates, and humans experience central pain syndromes in response to lesions
that involves the spinothalamic tract (berić et al., 1988; vierck et
al., 1990; koyama et al., 1993; weng et al., 2003). surgical interruption of the spinothalamic tract has been used for control of
intractable pain in humans (white and sweet, 1969), but the
procedure induced the delayed occurrence of allodynia and cps
in many patients (walker, 1943; king et al., 1957; triggs and
beric, 1992). our observations in rat thus seem applicable to the
response of the human nervous system to injury. altered painrelated behaviors in rats has been described after mechanical contusion (hulsebosch et al., 2000) or local ischemia (hao and xu,
1996). unfortunately, because degeneration is more widespread
in those forms of injury, it is difficult to determine with these rat
models, whether the pain symptoms result from interruption of
ascending spinothalamic afferent pathways or rather from the
severing of descending pathways that activate inhibitory intraspinal circuitry.
we observed that lesion-induced alterations in pain sensitivity were accompanied by abnormal neuronal excitability in populations of thalamic relay neurons in brain slices prepared 2
weeks after injury, without any evidence of altered excitability in
the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. furthermore, the maintenance
of this pathological activity in acutely prepared brain slices indicates that the alterations are intrinsic to the thalamus and not
projected on it from other afferent nuclei. there is abundant
evidence of altered excitability of neurons in vpl of thalamus in
human cps (lenz et al., 1987, 1989, 1993; jeanmonod et al.,
1993) (but see radhakrishnan et al., 1999) and in primate cps
models (weng et al., 2000, 2003), in the form of increased spontaneous activity, altered receptive field properties, and spike
bursts in areas innervated by the spinothalamic tract. we demonstrated that the thalamic hyperexcitability in the denervated
rat thalamus was due to an increase in bursting discharges in
response to local stimuli mediated by t-type, low-threshold,
voltage-dependent calcium channels, because it was eliminated
by the t-type calcium channel blocker,  xxxd2056xxx .
we hypothesized that this alteration in thalamic excitability
underlies the alteration in pain perception. consistent with our
hypothesis, treatment of lesioned rats with  xxxd2056xxx  restored normal pain sensation in response to thermal and mechanical stimuli, as well as normal open field exploratory behavior. we suggest that  xxxd2056xxx  may offer a simple and readily
tested therapeutic approach for the treatment of human cps.
 xxxd2056xxx  is widely used to treat childhood absence epilepsy,
and is safe and well tolerated in humans. it has not yet been tested
in human cps to our knowledge.
the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased bursting

in denervated thalamic relay cells remain unknown and may be
numerous. thalamocortical oscillations are driven by reciprocal
connections between excitatory relay neurons and inhibitory
neurons in the reticular nucleus (huguenard and mccormick,
2007) and zona incerta (trageser et al., 2006). the t-type calcium channel  xxxg307xxx  is the key component of this oscillation in
relay neurons, whereas  xxxg308xxx  and  xxxg309xxx  predominate in reticular neurons (talley, 1999). altered channel expression levels or
voltage dependence in either nuclei would increase bursting in
relay cells, as would changes in the strength of gabaergic inhibition (kim and mccormick, 1998a,b). changes in the biophysical properties of voltage-dependent sodium channels, particularly  xxxg2024xxx , in vpl have also been implicated (hains et al.,
2003, 2006). our results do not exclude the possibility of additional changes contributing to cps, such as alterations in downstream pain-gating mechanisms.
altered pain sensation has also been demonstrated previously
in rodents after spinal hemisection or large contusions (hulsebosch et al., 2000; hains et al., 2003; waxman and hains, 2006).
in these models, however, it is difficult to distinguish alterations
in the descending control of spinal circuits from alterations in the
sensory processing in the forebrain. for example, hains et al.
(2005, 2006) have suggested that contusion-induced potentiation of dorsal horn neuronal responsivity produces an increased
afferent activation of vpl neurons, leading to upregulation of
 xxxg2024xxx . our finding that lesions involving primarily the spinothalamic tract are sufficient to induce abnormal thalamic burst
discharges allows us to suggest an alternative model. we propose
that it is a decrease in the level of afferent activation of vpl neurons that triggers an increase in their excitability. in this regard,
the altered pain perception in cps represents a form of maladaptive homeostatic plasticity, in which cells in the thalamus compensate for the loss of activity by increasing their excitability. we
suggest that the increased gain of somasthetic sensory relay functions leads to an increase in the input received in primary sensory
cortices in response to the uninjured peripheral inputs (fig. 8),
where it is mistakenly perceived as a painful peripheral stimulus.
