abstract: reactivation of organophosphate (op)-inhibited acetylcholinesterase (ache) is a key objective
in the treatment of op poisoning. this study with native, wild-type, and mutant recombinant dnaexpressed aches, each inhibited by representative op compounds, establishes a relationship between
 xxxd1968xxx  acceleration of oxime-induced reactivation of op-ache conjugates and phosphoryl oxime
inhibition of the reactivated enzyme that occurs during reactivation by pyridinium oximes lüh6 and
tmb4. no such recurring inhibition could be observed with hi-6 as the reactivator due to the extreme
lability of the phosphoryl oximes formed by this oxime. phosphoryl oximes formed during reactivation
of the ethoxy methylphosphonyl-ache conjugate by lüh6 and tmb4 were isolated for the first time
and their structures confirmed by 31p nmr. however, phosphoryl oximes formed during the reactivation
of the diethylphosphoryl-ache conjugate were not sufficiently stable to be detected by 31p nmr. the
purified ethoxy methylphosphonyl oximes formed during the reactivation of ethoxy methylphosphonylache conjugate with lüh6 and tmb4 are 10- to 22-fold more potent than mepq as inhibitors of ache
and stable for several hours at ph 7.2 in hepes buffer. reactivation of both ethoxy methylphosphonyland diethylphosphoryl-ache by these two oximes was accelerated in the presence of rabbit serum
paraoxonase, suggesting that organophosphorus hydrolase can hydrolyze phosphoryl oxime formed during
the reactivation. our results emphasize that certain oximes, such as lüh6 and tmb4, if used in the
treatment of op pesticide poisoning may cause prolonged inhibition of ache due to formation of
phosphoryl oximes.

acetylcholinesterase (ache,1  xxxg38xxx ) catalyzes the
hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and terminates impulse transmission at cholinergic synapses. upon
inhibition of ache by organophosphorus (op) esters, a
conjugate between the gamma-oxygen of the active-site serine and
the op is formed, and the enzyme recovers activity by itself
very slowly. this may result in severe intoxication and death
of the exposed individual within a very short period of time.

during the past several decades, effective therapeutic measures
(antidotes) for op poisoning have been actively sought. some
nucleophilic oxime compounds, including the monopyridinium compound 2-pam and the bispyridinium compounds
tmb4, lüh6, and hi-6, were shown to reactivate opinhibited ache and greatly attenuate the toxicity of many
op compounds (1-5) (chart 1). however, in many cases,
little or no reactivation of the op-enzyme conjugate could
be achieved by these oximes, therein limiting their efficacy
as antidotes (6-8).
one factor responsible for retarding the oxime-induced
reactivation of op-inhibited ache is aging (dealkylation)
of the enzyme (9). aging is responsible for the rapid loss of
reactivatability of the op-enzyme conjugate under certain
situations. with certain types of ops, such as nerve agent
soman, the t1/2 of aging of enzyme varies from a few minutes
to half an hour, depending on the source of the enzyme (10,
11). in other cases, poor reactivation by oxime cannot be
attributed to aging and may be due to poor orientation or
inaccessibility of the attacking group of oxime to the ache
active center, as indicated in recent site-specific mutagenesis
studies (12, 13). another factor which can also affect the
reactivation of op-inhibited ache is the possibility that a
putative phosphoryl oxime (pox, including both phosphorylated and phosphonylated oxime) may be formed during

the reactivation and may inhibit the reactivated enzyme (1420). pox is believed to be an unstable intermediate, and its
presence in the reactivation medium has not yet been
confirmed.
in our previous study with oxime-induced reactivation of
emp-ache from fetal bovine serum (fbs ache), protection of the reactivated enzyme from pox reinhibition by
some quaternary ligands, such as  xxxd1968xxx , was proposed
(21). in the study presented here, we have attempted to
establish a relationship between  xxxd1968xxx -induced acceleration of reactivation and pox inhibition of the reactivated enzyme using fbs ache, wild-type mouse ache
(moache), and d74n moache expressed from recombinant dna, all inhibited with mepq and depq. our results
with three oximes, tmb4, lüh6, and hi-6, confirm that
acceleration of oxime-induced reactivation of ache by
 xxxd1968xxx  is due to the prevention of pox inhibition of
the reactivated enzyme. the two poxs formed during the
reactivation of the emp-ache conjugate by lüh6 and
tmb4 were isolated and characterized using 31p nmr. the
poxs were purified using hplc, and their stability and their
potency as inhibitors of ache were studied. the results
highlight the importance of pox inhibition of the reactivated
enzyme during oxime reactivation both in vitro and in vivo.
materials and methods
materials. mepq (racemic) and depq were provided by
y. ashani and h. leader (israel institute for biological
research, ness ziona, israel). the oximes lüh6, tmb4,
and hi-6 were obtained from the division of experimental
therapeutics, walter reed army institute of research.
hepes [n-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-n′-2-ethanesulfonic
acid] and mops [3-(n-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid]
were from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo). recom-

binant wild-type and d74n moaches were prepared as
described previously (22, 23). large quantities of native fbs
ache were purified as described previously (24). procainamide sepharose 4b affinity gel with a specific activity of
27 µm procainamide/ml was obtained from the israel
institute for biological research.
all solvents that were used were hplc grade. other
chemicals were analytical grade and purchased from commercial sources. rabbit serum paraoxonase (pon) was
purified by modification of the method used by gan et al.
(25) with  xxxd1689xxx -agarose chromatography
(sigma) followed by deae-sephacel chromatography
(pharmacia, uppsala, sweden) in the presence of a nonionic
detergent, tergitol np-10. sds-page showed that the
purified enzyme migrated as two bands with molecular
weights of about 41 000 and 44 000, in agreement with a
previous report (26). the activity of rabbit serum pon was
assayed using 1 mm paraoxon as a substrate in 25 mm trishcl buffer (ph 8.0) containing 1 mm cacl2.
ache assay. ache activity was determined spectrophotometrically by the method of ellman et al. (27). the assay
mixture contained 1 mm atc (or 5 mm for d74n
moache) as the substrate and 0.5 mm dtnb in 50 mm
napo4 buffer (ph 8.0). all measurements were taken at 25
°c.
titration of ache active sites with depq. increasing
amounts of depq (1-20 µl) were added to 0.5-2 units/
ml ache [60-100 µl of 50 mm napo4 buffer (ph 8.0)
containing with 0.1% bsa]. the mixture was incubated at
25 °c for 1 h. titration curves were constructed by plotting
residual enzyme activity against the amount of depq added
to the mixture. the enzyme active-site concentration was
calculated by extrapolation of the curve to zero activity.

phosphoryl oxime and reactivation of acetylcholinesterase
effect of  xxxd1968xxx  on the reactivation of emp- and
dep-fbs ache and moache. stoichiometric amounts of
mepq or depq were added to 2 units of fbs ache or
1.15 units of moache (0.005 nmol, each) in 50 mm napo4
buffer (ph 8.0) containing 0.1% bsa, in a total volume of
25 µl, and incubated at room temperature for 60 min to
inhibit enzyme activity. oxime (0.1 mm) in the absence or
presence of different concentrations of  xxxd1968xxx  was
added to the mixture in a total volume of 50 µl. after a
fixed time, the mixture was diluted 200-fold with 50 mm
napo4 buffer (ph 8.0) containing 0.1% bsa. a 100 µl
aliquot of the reactivation mixture was assayed for ache
activity using 3.2 ml of assay buffer. the percent reactivation was calculated as described previously (21).
influence of  xxxd1968xxx  on the reactivation kinetics
of emp- and dep-wild-type and d74n moache. the
time courses of the reactivation were monitored in the
absence and presence of 10 µm  xxxd1968xxx  using procedures reported previously (12, 21). to analyze pox inhibition under comparable conditions, the enzyme conjugate
concentration was fixed at 1.25 nm in all kinetic studies.
due to the nonequivalent reactivation rate of the two
diastereomers of emp-ache conjugates, an equation for
the two-component first-order approach to equilibrium was
used to fit the data, assuming an equal distribution of the
two species under the experimental conditions (12). since
only one species was created when ache was inhibited with
depq, a one-component equation was used to fit the
reactivation data.
31p nmr of poxs formed by reaction of mepq with
oximes. 31p nmr spectroscopy of poxs formed by reaction
of mepq with lüh6, tmb4, and hi-6 was performed using
a method similar to that reported for the measurement of
pox formed by mixing sarin with lüh6 (28). a mixture of
1 mg of mepq and 0.5 ml of 50 mm oximes in 300 mm
mops buffer (ph 7.7) in d2o (equal to ph 7.4 in h2o)
was incubated for 3 min at room temperature. the ph was
then lowered to 3.5 using 0.2 ml of 2 m  xxxd1710xxx /sodium
citrate buffer (ph 3.0) in d2o. the 31p nmr spectra were
recorded at 121.4 mhz in 5 mm tubes on a varian inova300 spectrometer at ambient probe temperature. all spectra
were recorded h-decoupled and referenced to (external) 85%
phosphoric acid (0 ppm). the spectra were measured under
the following conditions: spectral width, 8500 hz; acquisition time, 1.6 s; and pulse delay, 0. the total acquisition
time was 30 min.
hplc purification of poxs formed by the chemical
reactions. since poxs prepared by mixing oximes with
mepq contained excess oxime, and hydrolytic products of
mepq and poxs, they were purified by ion-pair reverse
phase high-performance liquid chromatography (rp-hplc).
aliquots of the mixture were injected into a vydac narrow
bore c18 column (2.1 mm × 25 cm, 5 µm, 300 d) attached
to a beckman model 126 pump and a model 168 diode array
detector controlled by beckman gold nouveau version 6.1
software. pox separations were accomplished by isocratic
elution using a solvent system of 0.005 m 1-heptanesulfonic
acid (pic-7; waters), 20% acetonitirile, and 0.5% acetic acid
in water (ph 3.8) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml min-1 at ambient
temperature. the samples were maintained at 4 °c prior to
injection, and peak fractions were collected on ice. the eluate
was monitored at 284 and 354 nm for the maximum

sensitivity for oximes and mepq, respectively. oximes and
mepq were identified by comparison of retention times and
absorbance spectra with those of standard solutions examined
from identical rp-hplc runs. the pox peak in the sample
of the mepq and lüh6 mixture was initially identified by
the hypsochromic shift (286 to 276 nm) of the lüh6 spectra,
as described by waser et al. (28). a hypsochromic shift from
284 to 274 nm was also found for the pox peak in the
mixture of mepq and tmb4. large-scale isolation of poxs
was accomplished as described above except that a waters
µbondapak analytical c18 column (3.9 mm × 30 cm) was
used. pox peaks from eight runs were pooled, concentrated
by lyophilization, and equilibrated in d2o for 31p nmr
measurements.
determination of hydrolysis rate constants (kh) of poxs.
the concentrations of purified poxs in solution were
determined by titration with fbs ache at a defined
concentration. for the determination of kh, 500 µl of 0.1
µm pox in different buffers was incubated at 25 °c. at
specified time intervals, 5 µl was transferred to tubes
containing 45 µl of 10 nm fbs ache and the mixture
incubated for 30 min and assayed for enzyme activity. the
kh values were calculated by fitting the inhibition data to
the following one-phase exponential decay equation:

(ei)t ) (ei)0e-kht

(1)

where (ei)t and (ei)0 are the concentration of fbs ache at
time t and prior to reaction, respectively.
determination of bimolecular rate constants (ki) of poxs
for the inhibition of aches. an initial trial of sample removal
for determination of the ki of poxs indicated that the
inhibition rate was too fast to be measured by this method.
thus, a continuous monitoring method was used to determine
the ki values (29). in this method, 5 µl of approximately
5-30 nm enzyme was added to a cuvette with 1 ml of assay
mixture, containing 0.15 mm dtnb, 0.075 mm atc, 0.1%
bsa, and different concentrations of pox in 20 mm hepes
buffer (ph 7.2). changes in absorbance at 412 nm were
monitored at 6-9 s intervals. pseudo-first-order inhibition
constants (kobs) were obtained by fitting data to the following
equation:

a ) a0 + (v0 - vss)/(1 - e-kobst)kobs + vsst

(2)

where a and a0 are absorbances at times t and 0, respectively,
vss is the slope of the steady-state phase, v0 is the initial
velocity of the time course for inhibition, and kobs is the
observed pseudo-first-order rate constant. replots of kobs
versus pox concentration yielded second-order inhibition
constants in the presence of substrate, which were then
converted to the second-order constants (ki) in the absence
of substrate by multiplying by a factor of (1 + [a]/km).
when the plot was linear, ki was estimated from the slope
of the line, assuming that the concentration of pox is far
below the dissociation constant of the pox-ache complex.
to ensure the accuracy of this determination, measurements
were taken in the linear range of substrate hydrolysis over
the entire reaction course.

wild-type moache was inhibited with a stoichiometric

amount of racemic, hplc-purified pox (>93% pure), and
reactivation with hi-6 was performed exactly as described
above for the reactivation of the mepq-inhibited enzyme.
31p nmr spectroscopy of isolated poxs formed during
the reactivation of the emp-fbs ache conjugate. isolation of pox formed during the reactivation of the empfbs ache conjugate was performed at 4 °c. approximately
80 000 units of fbs ache was adsorbed to a column
containing approximately 3 ml of procainamide-sepharose
4b affinity gel (0.6 cm × 3 cm). mepq (1 mm) in 4 ml of
6 mm mops buffer (ph 7.4) was used to inhibit ache on
the column for 30 min. excess mepq was removed by
washing the column with 6 mm mops buffer. reactivation
of the enzyme conjugate in the column was carried out using
4 ml of 6 mm mops buffer (ph 7.4) containing 1 mm
oxime and 0.5 mm  xxxd1968xxx .  xxxd1891xxx  min intervals, fresh
reactivation buffer was added to the column and the eluate
was collected. the ph of the eluate was immediately lowered
to 3.5 by adding 0.4 ml of 40 mm  xxxd1710xxx /sodium citrate
buffer (ph 2.9) to 1 ml of eluate. reactivation was nearly
complete after 40 min. the procedure was repeated five times
so a sufficient sample for each 31p nmr measurement could
be collected. the eluate (about 110 ml) was lyophilized to
less than 1 ml, and the h2o in the buffer was replaced with
d2o. 31p nmr spectra of the pox isolated from the enzyme
conjugate were measured using the same procedure as
described for pox formed from the direct mixing of mepq
and oxime, but overnight signal accumulation was required
to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio.

results
concentration-dependent enhancement of oxime-induced
reactivation of emp- and dep-fbs ache and wild-type
moache by  xxxd1968xxx . in our previous study, we
examined ligand-induced acceleration of reactivation of the
fbs ache-mepq conjugate with  xxxd1968xxx ,  xxxd1820xxx , and  xxxd3027xxx , and showed that  xxxd1968xxx 
significantly enhanced reactivation when lüh6 and tmb4,
but not hi-6, were used as reactivators (21). in the study
presented here, we examined the concentration dependencies
of  xxxd1968xxx -induced acceleration of reactivation using
both fbs ache and moache inhibited with mepq and
depq. the effect of oxime and  xxxd1968xxx  on ache
activity measurements in the assay was minimized by diluting
the reactivation mixture 200-fold with 50 mm napo4 buffer
(ph 8.0) containing 0.1% bsa. as shown in figure 1, the
concentration dependencies of  xxxd1968xxx -induced acceleration of reactivation of emp- and dep-ache were
similar for both enzymes. with emp-ache, significant
increases in the extent of reactivation were observed in the
presence of 100 µm and 1 mm  xxxd1968xxx  when lüh6
and tmb4 were used as reactivators (figure 1a,b). by
contrast,  xxxd1968xxx  did not accelerate hi-6-induced
reactivation. in fact, the level of reactivation was reduced
considerably in the presence of 1 mm  xxxd1968xxx . a
significantly higher level of reactivation was observed with
emp-moache than with emp-fbs ache with hi-6 as
the reactivator (figure 1c). similar results were observed
with dep-ache (figure 1d-f). however, the acceleration

removed by dialysis overnight at 4 °c against 50 mm napo4 buffer
at ph 8.0. reactivation was carried out in 50 mm napo4 buffer at

by 0.5 mm tmb4. data were fit to the one-phase exponential

was evident at lower  xxxd1968xxx  concentrations with
dep-ache than with emp-ache (figure 1d,e). these
results demonstrate that ligand-induced acceleration of
reactivation is dependent primarily on the reactivating oximes
and inhibiting ops.
effect of  xxxd1968xxx  on the reactivation kinetics of
emp- and dep-wild-type and d74n moache. reactivation kinetic curves of emp- and dep-wild-type moache
in the absence and presence of  xxxd1968xxx  are shown in
figure 2. in the presence of  xxxd1968xxx , an increased level
of reactivation was always observed for both emp- and
dep-ache when lüh6 and tmb4 were used as reactivators, but the curves for the time courses of reactivation
were biphasic instead of the theoretical monophasic curves
(figure 2a-d). biphasic kinetics observed with depache were obvious both in the absence and in the presence
of  xxxd1968xxx  but were not so apparent with emp-ache
due to complication of the two-component kinetic model in
the analysis. in the presence of 10 µm  xxxd1968xxx ,
significant increases in reactivation were observed. this
suggests formation of a putative pox in the reactivation
medium, since  xxxd1968xxx  as a reversible inhibitor of the
enzyme could protect the reactivated enzyme from inhibition
by accumulating pox. with hi-6, the data for the reactivation time courses of both emp- and dep-ache fit
monophasic reactivation well, and the presence of  xxxd1968xxx  did not affect the reactivation kinetics, indicating that
pox, if it accumulated, did not influence the reactivation
kinetics (figure 2e,f).
since putative poxs are cationic ops and it has been
shown that  xxxd74xxx  is a primary determinant for the specificity

of the enzyme for positively charged ops (31), we conducted
reactivation studies with d74n moache inhibited by depq
to show that this mutant was less sensitive to inhibition by
pox than the wild-type enzyme. the time courses for
reactivation of d74n moache shown in figure 3 support
this hypothesis since the reactivation data fit a monophasic
kinetic model well and no acceleration of lüh6- or tmb4induced reactivation was observed in the presence of
 xxxd1968xxx . these results further support pox accumulation and inhibition of reactivated enzyme during reactivation
with lüh6 and tmb4, and  xxxd1968xxx  accelerates reactivation by preventing pox inhibition of the reactivated
enzyme.
31p nmr spectroscopy of poxs formed by the chemical
reaction of mepq with oximes and purification of poxs
by hplc. a pox generated by mixing lüh6 with sarin with
a t1/2 of 13.3 min was readily detected by 31p nmr
spectroscopy (28). therefore, we measured the 31p nmr
spectra of mixtures of mepq with oximes. when mepq
and lüh6 were mixed at a ratio of 1:10, the mepq 31p
resonance signal completely disappeared within 3 min, and
a new resonance signal appeared downfield at about 41.6
ppm (pox) in addition to the organophosphoric acid signal
(27.6 ppm) (figure 4c). the 31p nmr spectrum of the
mixture of mepq and tmb4 also exhibited pox resonance
at about the same position (41.4 ppm), but the organophosphoric acid signal was much smaller, suggesting that the
decomposition of this pox is slower than that of the pox
formed between mepq and lüh6 (figure 4d). when mepq
was mixed with hi-6, no signal with a frequency close to
the pox position was observed; only the organophosphoric
acid signal appeared on the 31p nmr spectrum (figure 4e).
at neutral ph, the new signals at 41.6 ppm disappeared
within 1 h at room temperature. however, when the ph of
the mixtures was lowered to 3.5, resonances with amplitudes
of at least half of the original value were evident even after
26 h at room temperature (not shown). this result further
supports the fact that the new compounds that are stable at
low ph are indeed poxs formed by reaction of mepq with
lüh6 and tmb4 (named emp-lüh6 and emp-tmb4,
respectively).

pox formed by direct chemical reaction was examined by rphplc as described in materials and methods. the major peak at
a retention time of 9 min was identified as the original lüh6 by
comparing it with a standard sample. the new peak at a retention
time of 13 min was identified as emp-lüh6 by examining the
spectrum of the peak. mepq and 7-hq did not exhibit any
appreciable absorbance at 280 nm. the inset shows a comparison
of the spectra of lüh6 and emp-lüh6 showing the hypsochromic

all mepq was converted to the organophosphoric acid. (f) a signal
appeared for hplc-purified emp-lüh6, showing the disappearance of the organophosphoric acid signal (27.6 ppm).

hplc analysis of the mixture of mepq and lüh6 showed
the appearance of a peak with a retention time of 13 min
behind the major oxime peak (retention time of 9 min) at
280 nm (figure 5). the new peak at 13 min showed a slight
shift in the absorption spectra compared to lüh6 (figure 5,
inset), corresponding to the spectrum change reported
previously for pox formed between sarin and lüh6 (28).
the 31p nmr spectrum of this peak from hplc exhibited
only a single resonance signal at 41.6 ppm (figure 4f),
demonstrating that hplc separated the pox from the
reactants and hydrolysis products. similar results were
observed with hplc analysis of the mepq and tmb4
mixture, indicating a common pox structure (not shown).
31p nmr spectra of the mixture of these two oximes and
depq or paraoxon (an analogue of depq also yielding a
diethyl phosphoryl enzyme or phosphoryl oxime) did not

reveal resonances characteristic of diethyl phosphoryl lüh6
or diethyl phosphoryl tmb4, suggesting that these poxs,
if formed, were not stable. therefore, no attempt was made
to isolate poxs formed in the mixtures of depq with
oximes.
stability of poxs and the bimolecular rate constants for
the inhibition of aches by emp-lüh6 and emp-tmb4.
hplc-purified emp-lüh6 and emp-tmb4 were used
to determine their hydrolysis rate constants (kh) in different
buffers and the second-order inhibition constants (ki) for the
aches. the hydrolysis rate constant, kh, of mepq in 50
mm napo4 buffer (ph 8.0) was 0.0078 min-1 (table 1),
which is close to the value (0.01 min-1) reported previously
at this ph (31). lowering the ph of napo4 buffer to 7.2
significantly stabilized mepq where the t1/2 increased by
3.2-fold. some differences were noticed in hepes buffer.
in 20 mm hepes buffer (ph 7.2), emp-lüh6 and emptmb4 were very stable with t1/2 values of 169 and 315 min,
respectively. but in 50 mm hepes buffer (ph 8.0), they
are even less stable than in 50 mm napo4 buffer at the same
ph. the ki values of these two poxs for fbs ache and
wild-type and d74n moache were about 10-22-fold
higher than that of the parent compound mepq. mutation
of  xxxd74xxx  to n in moache yielded ki values 44- and 60-fold
lower than that of the wild-type enzyme (table 2).

the absence of hi-6, the emp-tmb4-inhibited enzyme did
not recover significant activity over 36 h, suggesting that
the binding of pox to ache is not reversible.
formation of poxs during the oxime-induced reactivation of emp-fbs ache. since emp-lüh6 and emptmb4 are stable even at neutral ph, we attempted to isolate
poxs from the reactivation of the fbs ache-mepq
conjugate by oximes and confirm their structures using 31p
nmr spectroscopy. in the reactivation medium, free pox
interacts with the reactivated enzyme to form inhibited
enzyme.  xxxd1968xxx , a reversible inhibitor, was added to
the reactivation medium to promote the accumulation of free
pox. the procainamide affinity gel column-adsorbed fbs
ache enabled the separation of reactivation medium from
the column in less than 2 min. after overnight scanning of
the concentrated sample from the reactivation of the empache conjugate by lüh6 and tmb4, the 31p nmr spectra
exhibited signals of emp-lüh6 and emp-tmb4 at about
41.6 ppm and a smaller signal at 27.6 ppm (organophosphoric
acid) (figure 7b,d). an additional 24 h after the first
overnight scan, the emp-lüh6 signal diminished and the
organophosphoric acid signal increased, confirming the
gradual decomposition of pox even at low ph (figure 7c).
when the same procedure was used for the 31p nmr
measurement of pox from the reactivation medium of
enzyme conjugate with hi-6 as the reactivator, there was

effect of pon on the oxime-induced reactivation kinetics
of emp- and dep-moache. organophosphate hydrolases
(oph) have been shown to be able to hydrolyze charged
op depq (32). if oph can catalyze pox hydrolysis, then
reactivation by oxime may be accelerated in its presence due
to the continuous elimination of pox. therefore, the effects
of rabbit serum pon (one of the enzymes that hydrolyze
ops) on oxime-induced reactivation of emp- and depmoache were examined. the reactivation kinetics showed
that reactivation rates of lüh6 and tmb4 for reactivation
of emp-moache were increased in the presence of 0.01
unit/ml rabbit serum pon (figure 8a,c). increases in the
extent of reactivation were more pronounced for dep-ache
when the same concentration of pon was present (figure
8b,d). this may be due to the possibility that pon
hydrolyzes only one of the two diastereomers of the pox

formed by emp-ache. in fact, acceleration of reactivation
by pon was evident only when more than 50% of the empmoache was reactivated, suggesting that only the pox
formed by the slow reactivation component of the enzyme
conjugate could be hydrolyzed by rabbit serum pon. when
hi-6 was used as the reactivator, no change in reactivation
rate was observed in the presence of pon for reactivation
of both emp- and dep-moache (figure 8e,f). these
results further support the conclusion from acceleration of
reactivation by  xxxd1968xxx  that pox inhibition occurs only
during reactivation with lüh6 and tmb4, but not with hi6.
discussion
oximes have been used in the treatment of op poisoning
for several decades to reactivate op-inhibited ache. although in vitro reactivation studies indicated that oximes,
such as lüh6, tmb4, 2-pam, and mmb4, might form
unstable poxs with op-ache conjugates and cause inhibition of the newly reactivated enzyme, the presence of pox
in the reactivation medium had not been confirmed (1420). in our previous study with emp-ache, ligand-induced
accelerations of reactivation were shown to be due to the
protection of the reactivated enzyme from pox inhibition.
because of the complication arising from the formation of
two reactivatable species of emp-ache from the chiral
(r,s)-mepq, the biphasic nature of the reactivation kinetics
with oximes was not identified (21). however, greater
increases in the second-order reactivation rate constants were
observed in the presence of these ligands with the slow

luo et al.
reactivation component than with the fast-reactivation component. in this study using both emp- and dep-wild-type
and d74n moache, we have established the relationship
between ligand-induced acceleration of reactivation and pox
inhibition of the reactivated enzyme. we also provide here
the first characterization of pox formed during the reactivation of emp-fbs ache by lüh6 and tmb4.
the concentration dependence of  xxxd1968xxx  on reactivation of emp- and dep-fbs ache and moache
showed that  xxxd1968xxx  accelerated lüh6 and tmb4
reactivation. however, when hi-6 was used as the reactivator,  xxxd1968xxx  did not accelerate reactivation. the
reduced reactivation at an  xxxd1968xxx  concentration of 1
mm reflects competition between  xxxd1968xxx  and hi-6 for
the active-site gorge of the enzyme conjugate, in agreement
with the 1000-fold higher ki value of  xxxd1968xxx  for
phosphonylated ache compared to that for the free enzyme
(33). the significantly lower extent of reactivation of empand dep-fbs ache compared with those of the corresponding moache conjugates by hi-6 may reflect species
differences for hi-6 binding (figure 1e,f). a study by
grosfeld et al. (34) showed that the binding affinity of hi-6
is 50-fold lower than that of tmb4 for dep-wild-type
human ache, which indicated that hi-6 has a low affinity
for certain mammalian ache-op conjugates.
there are three possible explanations for the lack of pox
inhibition observed when hi-6 was used as the reactivator:
(1) no pox was formed; (2) pox was formed, but it was
not sufficiently stable to accumulate and inhibit the enzyme
during reactivation; and (3) stable pox was formed, but it
is a poor inhibitor of ache. to delineate these possibilities,
we compared the 31p nmr spectra of mixtures of mepq
with the three oximes. mepq mixed with lüh6 or tmb4
showed that the main 31p resonance signals were due to
poxs, but the mixture of mepq and hi-6 exhibited no pox
signal, indicating that this pox was unstable, if it formed.
due to the structural similarity and the capacity for reactivation of hi-6 with lüh6 and tmb4, they should undergo a
similar reaction with the same op. therefore, a possible
answer is that the pox formed by this oxime is too labile to
allow it to accumulate and inhibit the reactivated enzyme.
determination of the inhibition constants of emp-lüh6 and
emp-tmb4 showed that they are very powerful inhibitors
of moache with ki values of approximately 1010 m-1 min-1.
this indicates that, at the conjugate concentration of 1.25
nm used in the reactivation study, if 20% of the conjugate
generated pox, half of the reactivated enzyme would be
inhibited by pox within 10-20 s. if it is assumed that the
pox formed during reactivation by hi-6 was as potent as
the two poxs described above in inhibiting ache, it is
estimated that this pox decomposed in less than 1 s, since
no pox inhibition was observed.
a study by hosea et al. (30) showed that d74n moache
was 2-3 orders of magnitude less sensitive to inhibition by
charged ops than the wild-type enzyme. since poxs are
also positively charged ops with a bulky cationic moiety,
they are expected to exhibit similar behavior. reactivation
studies of dep-d74n moache with lüh6 and tmb4
showed that the reactivation curves were monophasic in all
cases, and  xxxd1968xxx  did not affect the reactivation
kinetics, further substantiating the involvement of pox
inhibition in  xxxd1968xxx  acceleration of reactivation ob-

decomposed products of pox

formed during the reactivation of dep-ache by lüh6 or
tmb4 are much less stable than emp-lüh6 and emptmb4. therefore, even if these poxs are as potent as emplüh6 and emp-tmb4 in inhibiting d74n moache, their
short lifetime precludes them from inhibiting the reactivated
enzyme. mepq is a phosphonate, and the poxs it forms
with lüh6 and tmb4 (emp-lüh6 and emp-tmb4) are
stable. however, the poxs formed by the same oximes with
depq (a phosphorate) are less stable. these results suggest
that nerve agents such as sarin, soman, and vx, which are
all phosphonates, are likely to form stable poxs with lüh6
and tmb4 and inhibit the reactivated enzyme. this provide
an explanation for why reversible ligands,  xxxd1820xxx 
and sad 128, accelerate reactivation of sarin-inhibited ache
when present in the reactivation medium (35).
the results with wild-type and d74n moache suggest
that  xxxd1968xxx  acceleration is due to the prevention of
pox inhibition of the reactivated enzyme when lüh6 and
tmb4 were used as reactivators. when hi-6 was used as
the reactivator, no evidence of pox inhibition during the
reactivation was observed either from the kinetic curves or
from  xxxd1968xxx  acceleration. 31p nmr measurement of
pox signals in the mixture of mepq with these three oximes
showed that only lüh6 and tmb4 formed stable poxs, a
finding that supports results from the enzyme studies. most
importantly, poxs formed during the reactivation of empache by lüh6 and tmb4 were isolated from the concentrated reactivation medium, and shown to be identical to the
pox signals in the mepq-oxime mixtures by 31p nmr
spectroscopy. attempts were made to determine the structure
of poxs by electron-spray mass spectrometry analysis, and
it was found that they decomposed during evaporation even
when the lowest temperature was used. however, the
structure of emp-tmb4 formed from the mepq-tmb4
reaction mixture was determined by 1h nmr spectrometry
(manuscript in preparation) and is shown below:

according to the scheme, as reactivation proceeds, it results
in the accumulation of pox in the reactivation medium such
that a steady state is established between the reactants
(enzyme conjugate, e-op, and oxime) and the products (free
enzyme, e, and pox). once this steady state is established,
reactivation of the enzyme conjugate will not be evident until
appreciable pox decomposes and shifts the steady state to
drive the reactivation reaction. therefore, the formation of
stable pox results in the deceleration of the reactivation
process due to the inhibition of the reactivated enzyme by
pox.
measurements of the kh values of emp-lüh6 and emptmb4 showed that their decomposition rates differ with the
buffer. in hepes buffer (ph 7.2), they have t1/2 values of 3
and 5 h; this stability was surprising since poxs were
believed to be unstable intermediates formed during reactivation. at higher ph or in napo4 buffer, the stability of emplüh6 and emp-tmb4 decreased significantly (table 1).
although the inhibition potency of emp-lüh6 and emptmb4 for d74n moache was decreased considerably
compared with that of the wild-type enzyme, the ki values
for this mutant are still very high (>2.0 × 108 m-1 min-1).
at the conjugate concentration of 1.25 nm, inhibition of the
reactivated d74n moache is still possible, since the halflife of poxs is greater than 20 min. on the other hand, poxs

this is the structure expected for monophosphonylated
tmb4. on the basis of the initial 1h nmr observations and
the 31p nmr data, the structure of emp-lüh6 from the
mepq-lüh6 mixture and enzyme-generated poxs should
also correspond to monophosphonylated oximes. this provides the first direct identification of pox in the reactivation
medium of ache, though its existence was predicted more
than 40 years ago by wilson et al. (14) and hackley et al.
(15) using different ops and 2-pam. the resistance of pox
formation with hi-6 might arise from the oxime being ortho
to the pyridinium nitrogen. a near neighbor attack through

served with the wild-type enzyme. the lack of  xxxd1968xxx 
acceleration and pox inhibition during the reactivation of
dep-d74n moache is not due to the absence of pox
but rather to the decreased sensitivity of the mutant enzyme
to inhibition by pox.
inhibition constants determined with purified emp-lüh6
and emp-tmb4 showed that the two poxs are 10-22
times more potent than the parent op (mepq) in inhibiting
moache or fbs ache. the results support the contention
from reactivation kinetic studies that poxs are 10-100 times
more potent inhibitors of ache than parent ops (16-19).
the 44-60-fold decrease in ki values of emp-lüh6 and
emp-tmb4 for d74n moache compared to that of the
wild-type enzyme is smaller than the 100-1000-fold decreases which were observed by hosea et al. (30) using ops
with a thiocholine leaving group. the bis-pyridinium rings
of emp-lüh6 and emp-tmb4 exhibit enhanced charge
delocalization and accordingly would be less sensitive to
removal of a single negative charge. similarly, the potency
of mepq, a cationic op with a quinolinium leaving group,
was decreased only 54-fold after the d74n mutation.
if the inhibition of ache by pox results in the formation
of covalent complex like with other ops, then the conjugate
formed by interaction of pox with ache should have the
same reactivation kinetics as the mepq-inhibited enzyme.
examination of the reactivation kinetics of emp-tmb4inhibited moache using hi-6 as a reactivator that does not
form a stable pox showed that the reactivation kinetics of
this conjugate were identical to those of the mepq-inhibited
enzyme, suggesting that pox inhibits the enzyme by
covalently bonding to the active-site serine. therefore, the
following mechanism describes the role of pox in controlling oxime-induced reactivation of the ache conjugate:

9946 biochemistry, vol. 38, no. 31, 1999
formation of a six-membered ring may contribute to the
instability. one, however, would also predict instability of
pox formed by 2-pam.
the role of pox accumulation and inhibition in vivo is
not clear yet. however, results of this study showed that
poxs formed by lüh6 and tmb4 should be extremely toxic
if they are not removed and allowed to accumulate. the
finding that rabbit serum pon catalyzes the hydrolysis of
pox suggests that other factors may affect pox disposition
in vivo. pon activity is high in serum or liver in most
mammals, including humans (36, 37). although highly toxic
poxs may be produced in vivo when certain oximes, such
as lüh6 and tmb4, are administered to the body, hydrolysis
catalyzed by pon will eliminate these poxs. in addition,
poor penetration of oxime into the brain will also reduce
the toxic effect of pox, since pox should only be formed
outside the central nervous system and will not cross the
blood-brain barrier. therefore, if pox was to inhibit ache,
it would be formed at local sites not accessible to pon in
the plasma. hence, it is extremely unlikely that poxs would
survive after entry into the circulation.
when large amounts of op are present in vivo (such as
in a megadose pesticide suicide), the pox formed by direct
reaction of op with oxime may accumulate fast enough to
saturate pon activity and manifest its toxic effect. this may
be the reason for the unexplained peripheral paralysis of
respiratory muscle, the primary cause of death in the
intermediate syndrome (ims) observed during the treatment
of poisoning by some op pesticides and often correlated with
a sharp drop of cholinesterase activity in the blood when it
occurred (38-41). therefore, oximes, such as lüh6 and
tmb4, that may form relatively stable poxs and produce
inhibition of reactivated enzyme during reactivation in vitro
as confirmed by this study, or 2-pam and mmb4, as
indicated by several former studies (15-18, 20, 21), should
be used with caution during the treatment of op pesticide
poisoning. on the other hand, oximes that do not form stable
poxs, such as hi-6, may be good candidates in these
situations. the formation of pox during reactivation by some
oximes poses a very important consideration both in vitro
for comparing the reactivation potency of different oximes
and in vivo in choosing a proper oxime for the treatment of
op pesticide poisoning.
