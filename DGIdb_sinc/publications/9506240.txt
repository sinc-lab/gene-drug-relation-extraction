in the mid-1980s it was discovered that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5ht) was at least partially responsible for producing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. it was therefore realised that serotonin receptor blockade with
serotonin  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists could inhibit chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting.
5-ht3 antagonists have different chemical structures and receptor binding
affinity. granisetron,  xxxd1924xxx  and its major metabolite are pure 5-ht3 antag-

onists, while ondansetron and  xxxd3451xxx  are weak antagonists at the 5-ht 4 receptor. ondansetron has also been demonstrated to bind at other serotonin receptors and to the opioid  xxxg1635xxx .
the half-lives of granisetron,  xxxd3451xxx  and the active metabolite of  xxxd1924xxx  are 2 to 3 times longer than that of ondansetron. these observations initially
suggested that more frequent ondansetron administration would be required;
however, it has now been shown that receptor blockade does not correlate with
elimination half-life and all 5-ht3 antagonists can be effectively administered
once daily.
clinical trials have been conducted that directly compare the 5-ht3 antagonists. to compare these studies, it is necessary to assess trial design, including
known risk factors for the development of chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting, and response criteria. stratification for risk factors, use of strict efficacy
criteria and randomisation to a blinded trial using an appropriate comparative
regimen are essential for a well designed antiemetic trial.
comparative clinical trials using various doses, routes and regimens of administration have been conducted with 5-ht3 antagonists. despite some trial design
shortcomings, most of the studies show equal efficacy between the agents, especially in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and mild, infrequently occurring
adverse effects. the addition of steroids also appears to improve outcome. however, since many doses and regimens of ondansetron were used, further study is
needed to determine the optimal regimen.
the efficacy of 5-ht3 antagonists in controlling delayed nausea and vomiting
from chemotherapy is less well studied. further, there is no good scientific rationale for the use of 5-ht3 antagonists in controlling delayed nausea and vomiting
since serotonin has not been shown to be released during the delayed phase. in
fact, most studies show no benefit or modest benefit of 5-ht3 antagonists over
placebo.
because the 5-ht3 antagonists perform similarly in the clinical setting, pharmacological differences do not seem to translate into therapeutic differences.
there is also no appreciable difference in the incidence or severity of adverse
effects among the 5-ht3 antagonists. determination of clinical use may then be
driven by cost.

until the introduction of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht)  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists,
control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting was either inadequate or produced unacceptable adverse effects. 5-ht3 antagonists have improved the control of nausea and vomiting without
producing concomitant unacceptable adverse effects. there are currently four of these agents available worldwide and all four are deemed effective
and safe, but each has different characteristics and
has been studied under different clinical conditions. this report reviews the pharmacological differences and the comparative clinical trials with

these 5-ht3 antagonists to highlight their differences and clinical efficacy.
1. pathophysiology of chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting
in order to understand the antiemetic pharmacology of 5-ht3 antagonists, it is necessary to understand the pathophysiology of chemotherapyinduced nausea and vomiting. while the events
leading to vomiting have been elucidated, the
mechanisms that trigger nausea are less well understood.
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists

1.1 the mechanisms of the
emetic response

vomiting results from an intricate series of
physiological events mediated by humoral factors
and afferent fibres and both inhibition and excitation of somatic visceral musculature that are ultimately coordinated by the vomiting centre.[1,2] the
emetic centre is a nucleus of cells located in the
medulla and is the motor centre responsible for the
coordination of emesis. afferent input to the
emetic centre originates from at least 4 sources; the
chemoreceptor trigger zone (ctz), the cortex, the
vestibular apparatus and the gastrointestinal tract.
vomiting occurs when efferent impulses are sent
from the emetic centre to the salivation centre, abdominal muscles, respiratory centre and cranial
nerves.
with respect to chemotherapy and radiation
therapy, the ctz, the gastrointestinal tract and the
cerebral cortex have been identified as sources of
afferent input to the emetic centre.[1,2] the cerebral
cortex does not appear to provide input to the ctz
in acute chemotherapy-induced vomiting, but may
stimulate the emetic centre in anticipatory vomiting. the gastrointestinal tract is directly connected
to the emetic centre via the nucleus tractus solitarius and it also contains afferent fibres which terminate at the ctz. because of its location within
the area postrema, the ctz is exposed to both
cerebrospinal fluid and the systemic circulation:
thus, substances circulating in both of these fluids
can stimulate the ctz to release neurotransmitters.
all of the afferent inputs received by the vomiting
centre are controlled by neurotransmitters and their
receptors.
1.2 neurotransmitters and receptors
involved in chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting

dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine and serotonin are all neurotransmitters which are involved in
the emetogenic pathways stimulated by radiation
and chemotherapy.[2,3] receptors for each of these
neurotransmitters are found in abundance in the

emetic centre, the ctz and the gastrointestinal
tract. activation of these receptors by chemotherapy, metabolites and/or neurotransmitter release
caused by chemotherapy may all be responsible for
inducing nausea and vomiting.
the mechanism by which chemotherapy stimulates nausea and vomiting was only partially understood until that by which metoclopramide prevents
nausea and vomiting was identified.[4] before the
discovery of 5-ht3 receptors, it was assumed that
dopamine receptor blockade was the mechanism
by which metoclopramide produced its antiemetic
activity. only later was it discovered that high
doses of metoclopramide were blocking 5-ht3 receptors and that binding of serotonin to these receptors stimulated vagal afferent neurons supplying the upper gut.
serotonin, found in high concentrations within
the enterochromaffin cells in the gut,[1,5] is additionally located primarily in the cns and platelets.
5-ht3 receptors are widely distributed in peripheral tissues, the nucleus tractus solitarius and the
ctz where most vagal afferents enter the brain.
peripherally, chemotherapy and radiation cause release of serotonin from enterochromaffin cells
which are found in the gut and which activate the
abdominal vagal afferents.[6]
it has been shown that urinary excretion and
plasma concentrations of the major metabolite of
serotonin, 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-hiaa),
is increased after administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy[7] and is not affected by the
administration of 5-ht3 antagonists. thus, peripherally, 5-ht3 antagonists do not prevent release of
serotonin, but bind to the 5-ht3 receptors and prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
by preventing agonism of the  xxxg1116xxx  by
serotonin. the largest concentration of 5-ht3 receptors in the cns is the nucleus tractus solitarius
and the area postrema where the ctz is located and
where vagal afferents enter the brain. although not
well characterised, it is also believed that 5-ht3
antagonists may mediate nausea and vomiting by
interaction with these central receptors.[8]

2. comparative pharmacology of the
 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists
since their discovery, several  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists have been identified and are listed in
table i. granisetron, ondansetron,  xxxd3451xxx  and
 xxxd1924xxx  are the four drugs of this class that have
been approved to date in different countries worldwide for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting. although they all share a
common mechanism of action in preventing nausea
and vomiting, there are differences in their pharmacological profiles. the major differences are
found in their chemical structure,  xxxg1116xxx 
affinity, dose-response curve and pharmacokinetic
profile. the 5-ht3 antagonists have different
chemical structures:[9] ondansetron is a carbazole
derivative, while granisetron is an indazole, and
 xxxd3451xxx  and  xxxd1924xxx  are indole moieties.
ondansetron exists as a racemic mixture of 2 enantiomers. the others are single molecular species
without enantiomers.
2.1 receptor binding and affinity

using radioligand binding techniques and functional studies, at least 4 distinct serotonin receptor
types (5-ht1, 5-ht2, 5-ht3 and  xxxg1117xxx ), each with
various subtypes, have been characterised.[10] the
role of 5-ht3 receptors in mediating chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting is discussed in
section 1.2.  xxxg1117xxx  receptors are responsible for the
prokinetic activity in the gastrointestinal tract,[11]
while the function of the other receptors and their
subtypes is less clearly defined.
granisetron,  xxxd1924xxx  and its major metabolite have been identified as pure  xxxg1116xxx 
antagonists. while binding of these agents may occur at other receptors, the affinity is extremely low
compared with the binding that occurs at the 5-ht3
receptor. granisetron, for example, has >4000 to
>40 000 times higher binding affinity for the 5ht3 receptor than any other receptor type that has
been studied. the major metabolite of  xxxd1924xxx 
has an affinity for the  xxxg1116xxx  that is 23 to
64 times greater than that of the parent compound.

gregory & ettinger

in addition to  xxxg1116xxx  binding, ondansetron
binds at 5-ht1b,  xxxg1115xxx , alpha1-adrenergic and opioid
mu receptors and  xxxd3451xxx  binds to  xxxg1117xxx  receptors.[12] the affinity of ondansetron for the 5-ht3
receptor is 250 to 500 times that of other receptors.
despite the differences in chemical structure, receptor binding and affinity, these properties do not
appear to have an effect on the therapeutic activity
or adverse effect profiles of the 5-ht3 antagonists.
in addition, receptor binding and affinity studies
should be interpreted with caution: since they are
performed in vitro, they may not reflect clinically
important differences.
2.2 dose-response curves with the
5-ht3 antagonists

dose-response curves with 5-ht3 antagonists
have been compared in animal models and some
differences have been identified.[13] curvilinear
dose-response curves were identified for granisetron,  xxxd1924xxx  and  xxxd3451xxx  in animal models.
dose-response is linear up to a point when subsequent increases in dose do not result in equivalent increases in response. ondansetron has an unusual dose-response curve that produces an initial
decrease in emesis followed by an increase, and it
is not until the dose increases further that control
of emesis is regained.[14] differences in receptor

2.3 pharmacokinetic differences

some of the pharmacokinetic parameters of the
5-ht3 antagonists are summarised in table ii.[15-20]
granisetron and  xxxd3451xxx  have long elimination
half-lives compared with that of ondansetron.
 xxxd1924xxx , as the parent compound, has a short
elimination half-life (0.13 to 0.24 hours), but it is
rapidly metabolised to its active metabolite which
has an elimination half-life similar to that of
granisetron and  xxxd3451xxx . early clinical studies
of dosage regimens took into consideration these
differences in half-life; thus, ondansetron was initially administered 3 times daily compared with
once daily for the other 5-ht3 antagonists. it has
now been demonstrated that ondansetron, as well
as the other 5-ht3 antagonists, can be effectively
administered once daily[21-39] and that antiemetic
efficacy persists long after their plasma concentrations are undetectable. this indicates that interactions at the receptor level, not plasma pharmacokinetics, are the most important criteria for defining
efficacy.
other than differences in half-life, other pharmacokinetic parameters of the 5-ht3 antagonists
are very similar. thus, pharmacokinetic differences among these drugs are unlikely to contribute
significantly to clinical differences in activity.

3. interpreting clinical trials with
antiemetic agents
3.1 risk factors for developing
chemotherapy-induced nausea
and vomiting

there are known risk factors for the development of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. these are listed in table iii.[40] the efficacy of
antiemetics is influenced by variables such as the
patient characteristics and the emetogenic potential of the chemotherapy. these variables should be
considered carefully when examining studies of
the efficacy of any antiemetic regimen.

studies that are not matched for the patient risk
factors outlined in table iii may be potentially
biased. patients with a prior history of long term

alcohol intake have a decreased risk for the development of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,[41] while younger patients (<50 years old)
and female patients are at an increased risk for the
development of chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting.[42,43]
3.1.2 chemotherapy risk factors

certain chemotherapy regimens are more
emetogenic than others. table iv lists the emetogenic potential of commonly used chemotherapy
agents.[40] studies in which patients receive highly
emetogenic chemotherapy are likely to show
poorer results than those where the chemotherapy
is only moderately emetogenic. chemotherapy
dose is an important factor to consider when evaluating the antiemetic efficacy of 5-ht3 antagonists. some chemotherapy agents may be highly
emetogenic when given as a high dose and only
moderately emetogenic when given in lower doses.
in addition, combination regimens may be highly
emetogenic while the individual agents that make

up the combination regimen may have only moderate or low emetogenic potential. therefore, the
type and dose of chemotherapy should be considered when evaluating the efficacy of antiemetic
agents.
3.1.3 acute, delayed or anticipatory
nausea and vomiting

another consideration for assessing antiemetic
efficacy is the postchemotherapy period being
evaluated. for example, cisplatin causes acute nausea and vomiting that occurs over the first 4 hours
after administration, followed by delayed emesis
which may last for up to 7 days.[44] cyclophosphamide in high doses usually does not precipitate
initial episodes of nausea and vomiting until 12 to
24 hours after administration.[45] nausea and vomiting that begins within the first 24 hours after chemotherapy is known as acute nausea and vomiting
and, though it can be severe, is responsive to prophylaxis with antiemetic therapy. delayed nausea
and vomiting, occurring more than 24 to 96 or 120
hours after chemotherapy, and anticipatory nausea
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists

and vomiting, which is psychogenically mediated,[46] are distinctly different types of nausea and
vomiting from the acute type. 5-ht3 antagonists
are not effective for anticipatory nausea and vomiting and are considerably less effective in the delayed setting. familiarity with the patterns of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy
regimens is essential in interpreting clinical trial
results.
3.2 definition of efficacy

interpreting the comparative efficacy of antiemetics is made difficult by the fact that the efficacy criteria in clinical trials are not consistent.
complete, major and minor responses are defined
in terms of the number of episodes of vomiting or
retching and the severity of nausea. the number of
vomiting episodes and retches and the nausea assessment scales that define each degree of response
vary from study to study. this makes direct comparison of the antiemetic efficacy of 5-ht3 antagonists difficult. in the past, complete responses
have been defined as no episodes of vomiting or
retching and no or mild nausea. major responses
have been defined as less than 2 vomiting episodes
or retches and/or mild to severe nausea, while minor responses were 2 to 4 vomiting episodes or
retches. failures were most often defined as >4 episodes of vomiting of a 24 hour period of time.
many studies are designed to look at the episodes
of emesis as the primary end-point, and may not
consider nausea as an end-point when, in fact, patients may find nausea to be more disturbing than
vomiting. it is most appropriate to evaluate nausea
and vomiting separately, and to base efficacy statements on both parameters.
3.3 clinical trial design

placebo arm trials of antiemetics are considered
unethical, since effective regimens are available
for preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and
vomiting. the efficacy of new agents or their use
in different doses, regimens or setting is determined by using another antiemetic regimen as the
comparative regimen. if the comparative regimen

179

is suboptimal, bias may be created in favour of the
study regimen. well designed trials should use the
most effective available antiemetic regimen as the
comparator in antiemetic trials. patients and investigators also should be blinded to prevent bias, especially since nausea and patient preference are
both subjective outcomes.
4. comparative efficacy of
5-ht3 antagonists for controlling
acute nausea and vomiting
all currently marketed 5-ht3 antagonists have
been demonstrated to be efficacious in preventing
acute chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting
with both moderately and highly emetogenic
chemotherapy regimens. they also have greater efficacy and less toxicity than other classes of agents
for treating this problem. clinically important differences among the 5-ht3 antagonists have been
difficult to demonstrate. table v summarises studies that have been conducted to directly compare
efficacy among the 5-ht3 antagonists currently
available for patient use.
4.1 comparative clinical trials of
5-ht3 antagonists in acute
nausea and vomiting

in an open label study by bonneterre et al.[21]
there was no statistically significant difference
found in the complete control of either nausea or
vomiting by either ondansetron or granisetron during the first 24 hours after moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy. 90% of the patients were female,
most undergoing treatment for breast cancer. this
study also compared delayed emesis control on
days 2 to 5 and found no difference between the
groups (granisetron 37%, ondansetron 32%) over
this period, despite the administration of oral doses
of ondansetron for 3 days after the first day of chemotherapy in the ondansetron arm. there was no
patient preference expressed for either of the treatments and no difference in adverse events.
a second study by noble et al.[22] compared the
efficacy of ondansetron and granisetron in a placebo-controlled design. patients were receiving

fractionated cisplatin or ifosfamide administered
over a 5-day period. efficacy was evaluated after
the first and second cycles and for the 5-day treatment period. complete control rates of between 80
and 90% were achieved over the 24-hour period
following both cycle 1 and cycle 2. however, the
5-day assessment control rate was 40 to 44%. for
all assessment periods there was no statistically
significant difference between the 2 treatment
groups. interestingly, there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.048) in patients who expressed a preference for either of the two, with 26%
of patients preferring ondansetron and 34% preferring granisetron; however, there was no difference
reported in the incidence or severity of adverse effects or efficacy between the 2 groups and thus the
reason for the difference in patient preference is
unclear.
other studies have compared different dosage
strategies of ondansetron and granisetron. navari

et al.[23] compared the initial manufacturer’s approved dose of ondansetron in the us (0.15 mg/kg
intravenously) with 2 doses of granisetron, one of
which was the approved dose in europe (40 mug/kg
intravenously) and the other a dose which had been
found to be equally efficacious in other studies (10
mug/kg intravenously). the design was a rigorous
test of antiemetic efficacy because the mean dose
of cisplatin that patients received was 81.4 mg/m2,
but most of the patients were male. the results
showed equal efficacy among all 3 arms for both
nausea and vomiting; however, the efficacy rates
(30 to 40%) were low in all 3 arms. this is perhaps
the result of very strict criteria used to define complete control (no vomiting, retching, nausea or use
of rescue medications) and the high median dose
of cisplatin that patients received. a subset analysis was performed in 267 patients who had received ≥100 mg/m2 of cisplatin. total control was
achieved in 28 and 33% of patients receiving low
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

182

dose and high dose granisetron, respectively, and
in 25% of patients receiving ondansetron, although
patient numbers are probably too small to draw
valid conclusions.
ruff et al.[24] conducted a study directly comparing 2 different doses of ondansetron (8 or 32mg)
with granisetron 3mg in a group of patients receiving cisplatin. the study was randomised and
blinded and patients were crossed over. both nausea and emesis were assessed during the 24-hour
period after chemotherapy. again, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2
agents when assessing complete control of nausea
or vomiting, or in either of the parameters analysed
separately. this study also found no statistically
significant difference in patient global satisfaction.
the results of this study are somewhat difficult to
interpret because 14% of patients received <50
mg/m2 of cisplatin despite an eligibility criteria to
receive ≥50mg/m2. also, as in many of the other
comparative studies, rescue medication use for
breakthrough nausea or vomiting was not reported.
these results are interesting because the low dose
of ondansetron was found to be as efficacious as
the higher ondansetron dose and the granisetron
3mg dose. as will be demonstrated in other studies,
the optimum dose and regimen for ondansetron has
not yet been clearly identified.
the study by stewart et al.[25] is another test of
lower doses of ondansetron and demonstrates that
an all-oral administration of ondansetron may be
equally as efficacious as an intravenous-plus-oral
regimen in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy.
in this study, patients on the ondansetron arms received ondansetron 8mg either intravenously or
orally before chemotherapy, followed by oral
ondansetron 8mg twice daily for 4 days after
chemotherapy in both arms. the third arm of patients received granisetron 3mg on day 1 only and
placebo over the next 4 days. the 5-day assessment
period showed no difference among the groups for
emetic episodes, but the intravenous-plus-oral
ondansetron arm was superior to the granisetron
arm for nausea: 33 vs 25%, respectively.

gregory & ettinger

this study has important caveats. first, 26% of
the patients in the granisetron arm were rescued
with other antiemetics or withdrawn from the study
due to lack of response when comparing efficacy
for emetic episodes over the 5-day study period,
compared with 11% for the intravenous ondansetron arm; however, there was no difference in
nausea control for the same period among the 3
groups. the oral ondansetron group had a significantly higher percentage of patients who required
rescue or withdrawal compared with the intravenous ondansetron due to lack of emesis control
on day 1.
secondly, this is the only study comparing usual
doses of granisetron with ondansetron that has
demonstrated a statistically significant difference
in any efficacy parameter – a decrease in nausea
over the total 5-day period being found in the intravenous-plus-oral ondansetron arm. a possible
explanation is that a large percentage of patients
received cyclophosphamide-containing regimens
and it is known that emesis may not begin until 12
to 24 hours after that agent has been administered.
a more likely explanation is that the additional
doses of oral ondansetron received over the 4-day
period may account for the improved efficacy and
may signal the need for later administration of a
5-ht3 antagonist after regimens containing high
doses of cyclophosphamide.
other studies comparing ondansetron and granisetron in both highly and moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy have been published[26-29] and the
results have shown that both are efficacious in controlling acute nausea and vomiting and there is no
statistically significant difference between the two.
in the study by martoni et al.,[27] there was a strong
patient preference for granisetron; however, the patient numbers were small, the study was open-label
and no explanation can be given for the difference
since efficacy and tolerability were the same for
both the ondansetron and granisetron regimens.
the control rates of these 2 agents in acute
nausea and vomiting have also been shown to be
augmented by the addition of dexamethasone in
patients receiving highly emetogenic chemodrugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists

therapy.[29] patients had a 79 and 80% complete
control rate with ondansetron and granisetron, respectively, when intravenous dexamethasone
20mg was added before treatment. these results
have been confirmed in studies that have compared
dexamethasone, 5-ht3 antagonists and the combination of the two.[47,48] these studies also demonstrate that there is no difference between an 8mg
dose of ondansetron and a 3mg dose of granisetron,
when combined with dexamethasone.
although not approved for use in the us,  xxxd3451xxx  is available for use in europe and other
countries for the control of chemotherapy-induced
nausea and vomiting. studies comparing this drug
with both granisetron and ondansetron have been
conducted. in a study of 231 patients, marty et
al.[30] showed that  xxxd3451xxx  was as effective as
ondansetron in controlling emetic episodes in patients receiving ≥50mg/m2 of cisplatin (54 vs 65%,
respectively). jantunen et al.[31] compared  xxxd3451xxx  with ondansetron in a nonblinded, crossover
study in 39 patients receiving cyclophosphamidebased regimens. patients in both study arms also
received intravenous doses of dexamethasone
20mg before chemotherapy. ondansetron was statistically more effective in controlling acute vomiting (97%) than  xxxd3451xxx  (82%). patients on the
ondansetron arm were given the drug 3 times in the
first 24 hours, compared with only once for
 xxxd3451xxx  arm.
a study by campora et al.[32] showed that
 xxxd3451xxx  5mg given daily over 4 days was equivalent to ondansetron 24mg over 4 days in women
given moderately emetogenic chemotherapy for
the treatment of breast cancer. some of these studies comparing ondansetron with  xxxd3451xxx  have
potential flaws that might bias results, such as
small numbers of patients and unblinded, noncrossover study designs.[31-34]
another study with a similar design by jantunen
et al.[35] compared intravenous ondansetron, granisetron and  xxxd3451xxx , but the dose of ondansetron
(8mg) was lower. in this study, most of the patients
were female and had received prior chemotherapy.
granisetron was shown to be statistically superior

183

to ondansetron, but not to  xxxd3451xxx , for complete
control of emetic episodes. the low control rate for
ondansetron compared with the previous studies
may be due to: (a) the use of a single low dose of
ondansetron; (b) the lack of use of dexamethasone;
and (c) the possibility that additional doses within
the first 24 hours provide greater 24-hour efficacy
for a regimen containing cyclophosphamide. none
of these studies comparing the three 5-ht3 antagonists was blinded, and testing for carry-over effects of the crossover design was not reported.
 xxxd1924xxx  is the newest of the 5-ht3 antagonists to be approved for use in the prevention of
chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. to
date, there have been 4 studies published that compare  xxxd1924xxx  with either ondansetron or granisetron.
a comparison of 2 doses (1.8 and 2.4 mg/kg) of
intravenous  xxxd1924xxx  against a single dose of intravenous ondansetron 32mg in patients receiving
≥70mg/m2 of cisplatin has been published by
hesketh et al.[36] the majority of the 609 patients
in this study were female and had not received
prior chemotherapy. there was no difference in
emetic response rate among the 3 groups. a subset
analysis of patients who received ≥91mg/m2 of cisplatin also showed no difference in response
among the 3 groups; however, as expected, the response rates were significantly lower than those
seen in the lower cisplatin dose group (≥70 to
≤90mg/m2). nausea was evaluated on a visual analogue scale and also showed no difference between the  xxxd1924xxx  and ondansetron groups.
nausea was less well controlled in the group of
patients receiving the 2.4 mg/kg dose of  xxxd1924xxx 
compared with the 1.8 mg/kg dose. headache was
the most frequently reported adverse effect and
was also equal among all 3 groups.
a similarly designed study was performed by
audhuy et al.[37]  xxxd1924xxx  was administered in
the same manner as that reported in the study
above, but was compared with a single intravenous
dose of granisetron 3mg. all patients in this study
received cisplatin ≥80mg/m2, but not all were
chemotherapy naïve. no differences among redrugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

184

sponse rates were reported in this trial for either
nausea or vomiting. there was also no difference
in type or severity of adverse effects.
a comparison of  xxxd1924xxx  with ondansetron in
combination with dexamethasone was reported as
an abstract by lofters and zee.[38] patients received
either  xxxd1924xxx  or ondansetron intravenously on
day 1 with or without orally administered dexamethasone. this was followed by an oral regimen
of the  xxxg1116xxx  antagonist, again with or
without dexamethasone, for 6 days, for a total of 7
days of treatment. in patients who did not receive
dexamethasone, complete protection was significantly better in the group receiving ondansetron
(65%) than in the  xxxd1924xxx  group (56%). patients
who received dexamethasone in combination with
the 5-ht3 antagonist also had a superior complete
protection rate (66% with dexamethasone and 54%
without).
oral  xxxd1924xxx  has also been tested against oral
ondansetron for efficacy in moderately emetogenic
chemotherapy. fauser et al.[39] performed a doseranging study of oral  xxxd1924xxx  administered before chemotherapy compared with oral ondansetron 8mg before chemotherapy and every 8 hours
for 3 doses. the  xxxd1924xxx  200mg dose was significantly better than the 25, 50 and 100mg doses
in controlling emesis. ondansetron was significantly better than the 25 and 50mg doses of  xxxd1924xxx , but not the 100 and 200mg doses. in addition,
 xxxd1924xxx  200mg orally was statistically significantly better than ondansetron in controlling nausea, based on a visual analogue scale assessment.
4.2 summary of comparative studies

despite the shortcomings of some of the study
designs, the studies discussed above provide useful
information on the comparative clinical efficacy of
5-ht3 antagonists. although statistically significant differences in efficacy are reported in some
trials,[31,34,35,38] the overall preponderance of the
studies shows equal efficacy among all of the 5ht3 antagonists in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, especially for
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens.

gregory & ettinger

the report by jantunen et al.[35] reveals that intravenous ondansetron 8mg is inferior to intravenous granisetron 3mg (69 vs 80%; p = 0.034).
the difference in efficacy may be attributed to the
low dose of ondansetron used in this trial; however,
the italian group for antiemetic research reported
equal efficacy when these same doses were used in
combination with dexamethasone.[29] another
study by jantunen and colleagues demonstrated
that intravenous-plus-oral ondansetron 24mg is superior to intravenous  xxxd3451xxx  5mg, both in combination with dexamethasone in moderately
emetogenic chemotherapy.[31] another study demonstrates that ondansetron 24mg is effective even
in highly emetogenic chemotherapy.[26] despite
numerous trials that demonstrate efficacy, the dose
and regimen of ondansetron has not been clearly
defined.
it has been demonstrated from these studies that
intravenous granisetron 3mg is as effective as other
5-ht3 antagonists; however, the dose approved for
use in the us for granisetron is 10 mug/kg intravenously, which is somewhat lower than that approved in europe where many of the comparative
trials with granisetron have been performed. only
one of these comparative studies used the dose approved in the us;[23] however, this large, well designed study did demonstrate that the 10 mug/kg
dose has equivalent efficacy to the 40 mug/kg (approximately 3mg) dose.
 xxxd3451xxx  was found to be inferior to ondansetron and granisetron in one study[34] in which patient numbers were small, but the differences (44
vs 65 and 72% complete response, respectively)
were large in patients receiving highly emetogenic
chemotherapy. both granisetron and ondansetron
were superior to  xxxd3451xxx  (p<0.001 and p<0.004,
respectively). in another small study,  xxxd3451xxx 
was statistically inferior to ondansetron (82 vs 97%
complete response, respectively).[31] more comparative studies of  xxxd3451xxx  would be useful in
determining its comparative efficacy in the treatment of nausea and vomiting with highly emetogenic chemotherapy.
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists

in the 4 studies comparing  xxxd1924xxx  and ondansetron, only one showed a statistically significant difference in favour of the latter.[38] in 3 studies of highly emetogenic chemotherapy,  xxxd1924xxx 
was as effective in controlling acute nausea and
vomiting as granisetron and ondansetron.[36,37,39]
 xxxd1924xxx  has been less well studied than the
other 3 available compounds and has only recently
been approved for use, but these comparative studies show excellent efficacy and this agent promises
to be another useful alternative to the 5-ht3 antagonists already available.
4.3 comparison of adverse effects of
5-ht3 antagonists

it is clear from all of these studies that the safety
profile of each of the 5-ht3 antagonists is superb.
none of the studies, with hundreds of patients enrolled, has demonstrated any adverse effects that
are significant or severe. this is especially true in
comparison with the adverse effect profile of other
antiemetic agents. it is also clear that the adverse
effect profiles of the 5-ht3 antagonists are not different despite some pharmacological and pharmacokinetic differences. all of these agents are safe,
well tolerated and, in terms of adverse effect profiles, no different.
the adverse effects of 5-ht3 antagonists have
been reviewed[49] and are listed in table vi. they
are usually mild to moderate and transient, rarely
requiring drug discontinuation. headache is the
most commonly reported adverse effect, but is usually rated as mild to moderate and is relieved by
non-narcotic analgesics. this is the only adverse
effect of the antagonists that is reported to occur

more frequently in patients receiving those drugs
than in those receiving a comparator (other non5ht3 receptor antagonists such as antiemetics) or
placebo. fatigue and sedation are also usually reported as mild. extrapyramidal adverse effects are
not reported with the 5-ht3 antagonists, but occur
at a high frequency in patients receiving high dose
metoclopramide. there have been significant elevations in hepatic transaminases in patients receiving  xxxg1116xxx  antagonists, but these same elevations were not observed in healthy volunteers,
which suggests that chemotherapy is responsible
for hepatic toxicity, not 5-ht3 antagonists. electrocardiographic (ecg) changes have also been
observed with all of these agents, but were not clinically significant, and their relationship to the 5ht3 antagonists is unclear.[36,37,50-52]
4.4 is statistically significant
clinically meaningful?

despite the report of some statistically significant differences among the 5-ht3 antagonists, it is
difficult to know if these differences translate into
clinically meaningful differences, especially when
the majority of comparative studies show no differences in efficacy. the largest statistically significant percentage difference between treatment
groups was 15% in a study of only 39 patients[31]
and, in all of the other studies, differences in control rates were less than this. in addition, a similarly
designed trial of approximately the same number
of patients shows no statistically significant difference between the same 2 treatments.
patient preference for granisetron was observed
in 3 of 4 studies where it was assessed, and there
was no significant difference in the fourth. this
outcome is difficult to interpret, since only patients
who expressed a preference were included in the
evaluation and there were no differences in efficacy or adverse events to explain the difference in
preference. for these reasons, it is not clear that
this is a meaningful difference between granisetron
and the other 5-ht3 antagonists, but it is an area
that deserves further research.

5. comparative efficacy of
5-ht3 antagonists in delayed
nausea and vomiting
less is known about the efficacy of 5-ht3 antagonists for the prevention of delayed nausea and
vomiting. this can be a serious complication for
patients. it can be protracted and severe, and there
are very few good treatment options for its prevention. kris et al.[53] have reported the incidence to
be 93% in patients receiving high dose cisplatin.
the 5-ht3 antagonists have not been uniformly
effective in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting. urinary excretion of the serotonin metabolite,
5-hiaa, peaks at 6 hours after cisplatin chemotherapy and declines steadily thereafter to pretreatment levels by 24 hours.[54] this provides evidence that delayed nausea and vomiting is not
associated with serotonin release and that other
neurotransmitters must be involved.
ondansetron has not been shown to be consistently more effective than other treatments or placebo for preventing delayed nausea and vomiting.[55-60] gandara et al.[55] studied 31 patients who
had undergone chemotherapy with high dose cisplatin. after standard antiemetic therapy for the
first 24 hours, patients were randomised 2 : 1 to
receive ondansetron 16mg 3 times daily for 4 days
or a matching placebo. over the 4-day period, there
was no difference between groups in the number of
patients who experienced nausea or vomiting.
de mulder et al.[56] compared ondansetron with
high dose metoclopramide for the management of
acute and delayed emesis following cisplatin
chemotherapy in a randomised, double-blind,
crossover study. before the first course of cisplatin,
patients were randomised to receive one of the two
following regimens. group 1 patients received intravenous ondansetron 8mg before chemotherapy,
then 1 mg/h for 24 hours; followed by oral ondansetron 8mg administered 3 times daily for 5 days.
group 2 patients received intravenous metoclopramide 3 mg/kg before chemotherapy, then 4 mg/kg
infused over 8 hours and normal saline intravenously for the next 16 hours to maintain blinding, followed by oral metoclopramide 20mg given

gregory & ettinger

three times daily for 5 days. vomiting was controlled in only 24% of patients receiving ondansetron
and 27% of those receiving metoclopramide. nausea was significantly better controlled with metoclopramide than with ondansetron.
similar results were observed by jones et al.[58]
when they compared ondansetron and dexamethasone for both acute and delayed nausea and vomiting from cancer chemotherapy. no difference in
delayed vomiting was demonstrated between the 2
groups, while dexamethasone was significantly
better than ondansetron in controlling delayed nausea.
navari et al.[59] designed a study to determine
the efficacy and safety of oral ondansetron for
the control of delayed emesis in patients who had
not required rescue medication for acute emesis.
chemotherapy-naïve patients were randomised to
receive ondansetron 8mg twice daily on days 2 and
3, 8mg twice daily on days 2 to 6, or placebo on
days 2 to 6. efficacy results for both ondansetron
arms were combined. the percentage of patients
achieving a complete response and major response
with ondansetron on days 2 and 3 was 56%, compared with 37% with placebo. this is one of the few
studies that show any benefit of 5-ht3 antagonists
in delayed nausea and vomiting and is not confirmed by other studies.
 xxxd3451xxx [61,62] and granisetron[63,64] have also
been studied in the delayed nausea and vomiting
setting. complete responses have been reported to
be between 12 and 60% for cisplatin-containing
regimens and higher for non–cisplatin-containing
ones (78%). many of these studies are noncomparative and thus should be interpreted with
caution, since it is not known whether the 5-ht3
antagonist is superior to no treatment or placebo
and may simply correspond to the proportion of
patients who would not have developed delayed
emesis.
some of the comparative studies in table v also
compared efficacy in delayed nausea and vomiting,[21,22,25,30,33] although none of these studies was
designed specifically to evaluate this end-point. in
moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens,
drugs 1998 feb; 55 (2)

 xxxg1116xxx  antagonists

analysis of efficacy over days 1 or 2 through to
days 5 or 6 showed no difference between groups.
in the study by stewart et al.,[25] ondansetron given
in the delayed phase was superior to the placebo
administered in the patients who had received
granisetron on day 1. despite better control in the
ondansetron arm, there was no difference in global
satisfaction between the 2 arms. in general, control
rates in the delayed phase were low compared with
the acute phase control and were either low or no
different from the control rates reported in the literature in comparison with other antiemetic regimens.
overall, the efficacy of 5-ht3 antagonists for
the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting appears to be limited. numerous studies comparing
these agents with placebo or against combinations
with other antiemetic agents show little or no difference, and the response rates are low. studies
comparing the 5-ht3 antagonists directly have
also yielded disappointing results.[65] on the basis
of the release and excretion of serotonin after
highly emetogenic chemotherapy, there is also little theoretical evidence that would indicate that
this class of compounds would be useful. since
control of acute nausea and vomiting is one of the
most important predictors for the development of
delayed nausea and vomiting, the efficacy of these
agents in the acute setting may provide the most
important impact on delayed nausea and vomiting.
6. conclusions
the review of studies which have compared the
efficacy of 5-ht3 antagonists has yielded little in
the way of important differences in clinical outcomes. although all of these compounds have been
reported to be efficacious in preventing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in the acute
setting, none have shown impressive activity in the
delayed setting. however, the adverse effects of
5-ht3 antagonists are mild and when they occur
are easily managed, especially in comparison with
conventional antiemetic regimens.
the cost of the 5-ht3 antagonists is one factor
that should be considered when comparing these

agents. acquisition costs of 5-ht3 antagonists can
vary considerably, making the most financially attractive choice for one institution different from
that of another. the route of administration and the
total daily dose used must be considered when examining cost. using lower doses of antiemetics to
lower the cost of therapy must be balanced against
the likelihood of failing to prevent nausea and
vomiting. the decision as to which antiemetic is
most cost effective can only be made once the optimal dose and schedule for the given drug in the
target population is established. this will require
further comparative studies using different doses,
regimens and routes of administration for the 5ht3 antagonists.
