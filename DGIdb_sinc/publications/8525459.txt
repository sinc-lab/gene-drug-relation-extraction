abstract
the long-term effects of a unique injection of reserpine (5 mgkg s.c.) on
the vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  and dopamine uptake complex have been investigated, in parallel with behavioral and neurochemical effects. early after treatment, a
dramatic decrease in locomotor activity, as well as a marked depletion in striatal dopamine (da), associated with a prominent enhancement in dopaminergic turnover were
observed in reserpine-treated rats. from 2 to 60 days after reserpine injection, a recovery
in locomotor activity occurred, in parallel with an increased da content in the striatum,
reaching about 50%of controls a t day 60. at this time, the dopamine turnover was quite
normal. the density of the dopamine uptake sites in the striatum, studied with 3h
gbr12783, was unchanged after reserpine treatment at any time studied up to 60 days.
by contrast, the density of binding sites for 3h dihydrotetrabenazine (3h tbzoh), a
marker for the vesicular  xxxg2099xxx , remained dramatically decreased in
the striatum all over the time of the study (> -90% of controls a t day 2 and -80% at day
30 and 60). a lesser decrease (-60%) was observed in the substantia nigra pars compacta
(snc), 2 and 30 days after reserpine treatment. this suggests that at least 60%of the
vesicular  xxxg2099xxx  is sensitive to reserpine in this cell bodies region,
indicating that this proportion of the transporter is integrated in functional vesicles, a
prerequisite for reserpine binding. on the other hand, in spite of profound modifications
of da levels and neuronal activity, induced by a persistent blockade of the vesicular
uptake process, the density of mrna encoding the vesicular  xxxg2099xxx 
remained constant in the snc from 2 to 60 days following reserpine injection.

introduction
synaptic vesicles are cellular organelles which store
the neurotransmitters in the nerve terminals of the
central and peripheral nervous system. neurotransmitters accumulated in these vesicles are released into
the synaptic cleft upon depolarization of the terminals,
by ca2+-dependent exocytosis.
synaptic vesicles concentrate the neurotransmitter
from the cytosolic pool, via an uptake mechanism, coupled with an atp-dependent  xxxg215xxx  (henry and
scherman 1989). in the case of monoamines, the use of
0 1995 wiley-liss, inc.

inhibitors of the corresponding vesicular uptake system, reserpine and  xxxd3330xxx , provided much information on the mechanism of amine translocation (for
review see henry and scherman, 1989). the tritiated
form of dihydrotetrabenazine (3h tbzoh) was used as
a marker of the  xxxg2099xxx  for in vitro
studies, both in the adrenal gland and in the central
nervous system (darchen et al., 1990; scherman et al.
1983).

two vesicular monoamine transporters ( xxxg2099xxx )
genes have been found to be expressed in the rat. the
vmatl (initially referred to as chromaffin granule
amine transporter-“ xxxg2098xxx ) is expressed in the adrenal
gland (liu et al., 1992), whereas the vmat2 (initially
referred t o as  xxxg2099xxx “ xxxg2099xxx ) is expressed in the brain (erikson et al., 1992).
by contrast, in another species, like bovine, the same
transporter gene ( b w t 2 ) is expressed in both adrenal gland and brain (krejci et al., 1993).
reserpine has been known for a long time as a
monoamine depleting agent, inducing temporally related alterations in behavioral activity (segal et al.,
1971), and modifications in dopamine turnover (algeri
et al., 1987). the present work was aimed at studying
the long-term effects of reserpine i) on the expression of
the vesicular transporter, i.e., on the density of ,htbzoh binding sites, ii) on the density of mrna for
vmat2 in the nigrostriatal pathway, and iii) on the
density of the membrane da uptake complex. in situ
hybridization was used to evaluate the level of vmat2
gene expression in the dopaminergic cells of the snc
and to search for a possible regulation of the process
after reserpine treatment. in parallel, the levels of
dopamine and its metabolites, and locomotor activity of
the treated rats, were measured over a period of 2
months, to assess the neurochemical and behavioral
effects of reserpine, and to follow a possible recovery
process. we also investigated the effects of reserpine on
the density of the da uptake sites, with the specific
ligand
gbr 12783 (bonnet et al., 19861, throughout
the same period.

materials and methods
animals and treatments
the studies were performed on male sprague-dawley rats (250-280 g), purchased from charles river
(saint-aubin les elbeuf, france). the animals were
housed six per cage under controlled temperature and
lighting conditions (23 1°c; light on 8 a.m.-6 p.m.1
and had access to food and water ad libitum. rats received an injection of reserpine (5 mgkg s.c.) or saline
(controls).

*

locomotor activity
locomotor activity was assessed using a digiscan animal activity monitor built by omnitech electronics
(columbus, oh). this system consisted of photocell
cages (length = 40 cm; width = 40 cm; height = 30 cm)
that were interfaced with an apple i1 computer. the
cages were placed in a dimly lit sound attenuating
room. motor activity was monitored by 16 infra-red
light beam sensors located around the perimeter of the
monitor. the horizontal activity was expressed by the
total number of beam interruptions that occurred in the
sensor during the test. motor activity was measured
during 8 h, between 7:oo p.m. and 3:oo a.m., on the

nights preceding days 2, 7,20, 30, and 60, as well as on
the 12th night following injection.
homogenates preparation
rats were sacrificed in a cold room (4°c)by decapitation on days 2, 7, 20, 30, or 60 after reserpine or saline
injection. the striatum was homogenized in 1 ml icecold 0.32 m sucrose using a teflon-glass homogenizer
(10 strokes, 800 rpm). the homogenate was distributed
in fractions for hplc determination of dopamine and
its metabolites,
tbzoh binding, and 3h-gbr12783
binding.
hplc determination of dopamine and
its metabolites
homogenate was sonicated in ice-cold perchloric acid
0.1 n containing 0.1% cysteine; then it was centrifuged
(10,000 g, 10 min.) and the supernatant injected into
the hplc system. da and its metabolites, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac) and homovanillic acid
(hva) were measured using a reverse-phase ion-pair
hplc system, consisting in a beckman 114m pump
coupled to a beckman column (c18,2 x 250 mm, 5 km)
and an electrochemical detector (lc-4b, bas) with a
glassy carbon electrode set at + 0.8 v. the sensitivity of
detection was 0.2 na. the mobile phase consisted of
kh,po, 55 mm, methanol 4.8% (voyvol),heptanesulfonic acid 4.5 mm, and na,edta 0.03% (wt/vol),ph 3.85.
binding assay of 3h-tbzoh
membranes were sonicated and then incubated during 1h in naoh-hepes 20 mm, sucrose 0.32 m, ph 8.0,
in the presence of 15 nm 3h-tbzoh (spec. act. 30 ci/
mmol; dositek, orsay, france) in a final volume of 0.4
ml (adapted from scherman et al., 1988). preliminary
studies had shown that this concentration was saturating on striatal membranes. for the determination of
non-specific binding, membranes were incubated in the
same conditions plus 2 pm unlabelled  xxxd3330xxx  (fluka,
switzerland). the protein concentration, determined
according to the method of lowry et al. (19511,was 0.33
mg/ml. the incubation was stopped by the addition of
ice-cold tris hc120 mm, sucrose 0.32 m ph 8.0 buffer,
and filtration through whatman gf:b filters, which
were rinsed twice with the same buffer. total and
bound radioactivity were determined by liquid scintillation.

reduction of the amide precursor with
diborane by
amersham, les ulis, france) in a final volume of 4 ml
(adapted from bonnet et al., 1990). preliminary studies
had shown that the concentration 4 nm was saturating
in our assay conditions on striatal membranes. for the

determination of non-specific binding, membranes
were incubated in the same conditions with 10 (j.m
 xxxd2546xxx  (sandoz, basel, switzerland). the protein
concentration, determined according to the method of
lowry et al. (19511, was 0.05 mg/ml. the incubation
was stopped by the addition of ice-cold medium and
filtration through whatman gf:b filters, which were
rinsed twice with the same buffer. total and bound
radioactivity were determined by liquid scintillation.
preparation of brain sections
rats were sacrificed by decapitation, the brains were
quickly removed, frozen in isopentane at -3o"c, and
stored at -30°c. coronal 15 km thick tissue sections
were cut in a cryostat a t -22°c throughout the snd
ventral tegmental area complex (between a 4.52
and 6.04 mm from bregma, according to paxinos and
watson, 19861,and thaw-mounted onto cold polylysinegelatin-coated glass slides. tissue sections were dehydrated at 4°c for 1 h and stored at -30°c until processing.
autoradiographic determination of the 3h-tbzoh
binding sites density
brain sections, a t the level of the sndventral
tegmental area complex, were preincubated at room
temperature in hepes-sucrose buffer (sucrose 300
mm, naoh-hepes 20 mm, ph 8.01, and incubated 1h
in the same buffer containing 7.5 nm 3h-tbzoh to
assess total binding to the sections (darchen et al.,
1990). non-specific binding was evaluated on adjacent
sections incubated in the same conditions plus 2 pm
unlabelled  xxxd3330xxx . the slides were then rinsed three
times at 4°c in tris-hc1 sucrose buffer (tris 40 mm,
sucrose 32 mm, ph 8.0) and dried under a cold air
stream. in the conditions used, total binding did not
exceed 12%of the total amount of ligand present in the
incubation medium, and about 65% of the binding was
specific at the level of snc. the sections were apposed
onto lkb ultrofilm 3h for 8 weeks with tritiated standard strips (amersham, les ulis, france).
preparation of labeled crna probes
vmat2 crna antisense probes were synthesized
from bvmat2 cdna insert cloned in pbluescript-sk(krejci et al., 1993). the plasmid was linearized by
bamhl for antisense rna synthesis by t7 polymerase.
the in vitro synthesis was carried out using the
promega kit and the probes were labelled with 35s-utp
(1,000 ci/mmol; 20 pm). transcript size was then reduced by limited alkaline hydrolysis to facilitate intracellular penetration. unincorporated nucleotides were
removed by phenokhloroform treatment followed by
ethanol precipitation (blanchard et al., 1994).
in situ hybridization
in situ hybridization histochemistry was performed
on tissue sections as previously described by strada

31

et al. (1992). tissue sections were quickly brought at
room temperature, dried for 30 min, and then post fixed
in 3% paraformaldehyde. they were treated with 0.25%
acetic anhydride in 0.1 m ethanolamine (ph 8)to acetylate the amino group and reduce non-specific binding,
followed by 0.1 m glycine treatment for 30 min and
dehydration in graded alcohols. the sections were then
incubated for 3.5 h at 50°c in a humid chamber with 40
pl of hybridization solution containing the antisense
35s-labelled rna probe (10 x lo6 cpm per section)
sealed under a coverslip. the coverslips were removed
in 2 x ssc (0.3 m  xxxd3213xxx /0.003 m sodium citrate ph 71, and sections were washed a t 50°c in 50%
formamidel2 x ssc, incubated for 30 min at 37°c with
 xxxg1963xxx  (sigma, france; 100 pg/ml in 2x scc), rinsed
again a t 50°c in 50% formamide/2x ssc, and then
washed at room temperature overnight in 2 x ssc. after a final rinse in 2x ssc, the sections were dehydrated in graded  xxxd102xxx  prepared with 300
mm ammonium acetate, delipidated in xylene, rinsed
in 100% ethanol, and air-dried. the autoradiograms
were generated by exposing the slides to x-ray films
(hyperfilm pmax; amersham) for 5 days.
quantification of the autoradiograms
quantification of the autoradiograms was performed
on a biocom bio 500 computerized image analysis system. subregions of snc were defined in two ways: rostro-caudal and medio-lateral. for rostro-caudal subdivision, the rostra1 part corresponded to the three
anterior sections (a 4.52 to 5.12 from bregma, according
to paxinos and watson, 1986) and the caudal part to the
three posterior sections (a 5.43 to 6.04 from bregma).
for medio-lateral subdivision, three subregions of a
same width were made and designated from the medial
line: medial, intermediate, and lateral.
statistical analysis
means sem were compared using an analysis of
variance and student's t-test. in autoradiographic
studies, data from controls and treated rats were compared by means of dunnett's t-test. time-dependent
evolution was studied using an analysis of variance and
linear regression.

at day 2 and -80% at day 30). this discrepancy cannot
be attributed to the difference of method used to measure the effects of reserpine on the binding of 3htbzoh (membrane homogenate for striatum and autoradiography for substantia nigra). in the striatum, the
decrease of 3h-tbzohbinding, measured by quantitative autoradiography, was indeed of the same extent
(-94% at day 2 and -76% at day 30) (not shown). the
differential effect of reserpine in striatum and snc
could be explained according to the following hypothe-

sis. in the dopaminergic cell bodies of the snc, new
transporter molecules are synthesized, matured, and
stored in the granular endoplasmic reticulum and golgi
apparatus. these newly formed transporter molecules
could be thereafter integrated into functional vesicles.
it is known that reserpine binds to the transporter only
on sealed functional vesicles, “energized by the transmembrane electrochemical gradient (for review see
henry and scherman, 1989). our results suggest that
probably 60% of the transporters of the snc could be
integrated in “energized vesicles since they are accessible for reserpine. thus, the relatively high density of
3h-tbzoh binding sites measured in the snc after
reserpine treatment, could be partly attributed to the
reserpine-insensitive population constituted with
newly-formed transporters not yet integrated into
functional vesicles.
the presence of reserpine in tissues persists during a
long time (giachetti, 1978); the duration of the observed inhibition of 3h-tbzohbinding, far exceeds the
dissociation half-life
described for reserpine
(darchen et al., 1989). it is consistent with studies
which showed that reserpine binds essentially irreversibly to the transporter (rudnick et al., 1990). the binding of reserpine and tbzoh to chromaffin granule
membranes has revealed two high affinity binding
sites: site t for tbzoh and  xxxd2419xxx , and site r for
reserpine. it has been suggested that the t and r sites
are located on luminal and cytoplasmic faces of the
vesicular membrane respectively (henry and scherman, 1989). the binding of reserpine on the r conformation of the transporter could inactivate it and prevent monoamine accumulation into the vesicles. a
functional o r conformational alteration of the vesicular
 xxxg2099xxx  could be induced by the reserpine occupancy (deupree, 19881, thus leading to a persistent impairment to bind 3h-tbzoh.one cannot exclude that the reserpine treatment could induce a
modification of the affinity of site t for the ligand 3htbzoh. on the other hand, the effect of reserpine being long lasting, it is possible that reserpine, enclosed in
the neuronal compartment, could be locally released
after degradation of senescent vesicles and then rebound to newly formed transporters.
as the mrna level remains constant, it is not probable that the low density of 3h-tbzoh binding sites
observed after reserpine corresponded to a down-regulation of the transcription process of the transporter
gene. the long-term inhibition of 3h-tbzoh binding,
while mrna for vmat2 is stable throughout the time
of the study, could be attributed to a low turn-over
(synthesis/degradation) of the transporter molecuie.
in the nerve terminal, two functional pools of synaptic vesicles have been described (for review see greengaard, 1993): a releasable pool which undergoes exocytosis upon arrival of the nerve impulse and a reserve
pool corresponding to vesicles tethered to the cytoskele-
