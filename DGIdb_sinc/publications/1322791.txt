abstract
increasing the cellular concentration of dna  xxxg2312xxx  in
yeast by expressing constitutiveiy a plasmid-borne  xxxg2311xxx  gene encoding
the enzyme greatly increases the sensitivity of the cells to  xxxd168xxx  and
etoposide (vi'-16). this increased drug sensitivity at a higher intracellular dna  xxxg2312xxx  level is observed in both rad52* repairproficient strains and rads2 mutants that are defective in the repair of
double-stranded
breaks. these results provide strong support of the
hypothesis that the cellular target of these drugs is dna topoisomerase
ii, and that these drugs kill cells by converting dna  xxxg2312xxx 
into a dna damaging agent.

introduction
in recent years, dna topoisomerases have emerged as im
portant targets of antimicrobial and anticancer therapeutics.
these enzymes catalyze the breakage and rejoining of dna
strands to provide gates in them for the passage of other dna
strands. the opening of a gate in a dna strand by a topo
isomerase is accomplished by the breakage of a dna backbone
bond and the simultaneous formation of an enzyme-dna covalent bond, and the closing of the gate is accomplished by
breaking the enzyme-dna link and the rejoining of the dna
backbone. dna topoisomerases can be divided into two classes:
the type i enzymes break and rejoin one dna strand at a time,
and the type ii enzymes, through the actions of dyadic protomers in each holoenzyme, break and rejoin both strands of a
double-stranded dna. extensive mechanistic and physiologi
cal studies of these enzymes have been carried out in the two
decades since their discovery, and a number of recent reviews
have been published (1-4).
as early as 1976, genetic and biochemical data have impli
cated dna gyrase, a type ii enzyme also termed bacterial dna
 xxxg2312xxx , as the target of the nalidixic acid and coumermycin classes of antibiotics (5-7). several years later, it was
suggested that the cellular target of a variety of chemically
diverse anticancer agents, including anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, and aminoacridines, was most likely eukaryotic
dna  xxxg2312xxx  (reviewed in refs. 8-10). in 1985, eu
karyotic  xxxg2310xxx  was implicated to be the target
of an antitumor agent  xxxd412xxx  (11).
with the exception of the coumermycin class of compounds,
which appears to interfere with the dna-dependent atpase
activity of dna gyrase (12), all other compounds mentioned
above interfere with the topoisomerase-mediated
rejoining of
dna in vitro as well as in vivo. in the presence of such a
compound, the covalent enzyme-dna intermediate appears to
received 2/20/92; accepted 6/3/92.

society of america.

be trapped in a nonfunctional state, termed the cleavable com
plex, in which neither the rejoining of the broken dna strand
nor the passage of dna through the broken dna can occur
(reviewed in ref. 13).
the strongest evidence that bacterial gyrase is the cellular
target of nalidixic acid and various other quinolone drugs
comes from genetic studies of mutants resistant to these drugs
(reviewed in refs. 14 and 15). extensive analysis of escherichi
coli quinolone-resistant mutants shows that the mutations are
clustered in three regions: at asp 426 and lys 447 of the b
subunit, and around ser 83 of the  xxxg220xxx  (16-18). for eu
karyotic dna topoisomerase h-targeting drugs, at present the
evidence is built primarily on a correlation between the potency
of a drug and its ability to trap the covalent enzyme-dna
intermediate. recently, a single point mutation, which changes
the codon for arg 486 in the  xxxg2311xxx  gene encoding dna topo
isomerase ii to one encoding a lysine, was found in a human
leukemia cell line resistant to  xxxd168xxx  (19, 20). it is well
established that the amino and carboxy half of the single
polypeptide of eukaryotic dna  xxxg2312xxx  are homolo
gous to the b and  xxxg220xxx  of dna gyrase, respectively (21).
the position in e. coli dna gyrase corresponding to arg 486 of
human dna  xxxg2312xxx  is occupied by lys 447 of the b
subunit (22), which, as mentioned above, is known to be im
portant for resistance to the quinolones. there is no direct
proof, however, that the arg to lys mutation at codon 486 of
human dna  xxxg2312xxx  is responsible for the drug-re
sistance phenotype. in an independent set of experiments, a
mutation in amino acid 449 which converts arg 449 to gin, has
been postulated to confer resistance to  xxxd3309xxx  in human
leukemia cells (23). like the lys 486 mutation, there is as yet
no direct confirmation that the identified mutation is sufficient
to confer the drug-resistant phenotype.
we and others have recently reported the use of yeast in the
study of drugs that act on dna topoisomerases (24, 25). the
advantage of the yeast system lies primarily in the ease of ge
netic manipulations that can be carried out with this unicellular
organism. sensitivity of the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae to
anticancer drugs, for example, can be improved by the intro
duction of mutations that increase the permeability of cells to
the drugs (24, 26). studies with a set of isogenic strains of yeast
also showed that cells devoid of functional dna topoisomerase
i are resistant to the antitumor drug  xxxd412xxx , whereas
cells expressing wild-type  xxxg2310xxx  are sensitive.
these results show clearly that the cytotoxicity of  xxxd412xxx 
cannot be attributed to its inhibition of  xxxg2310xxx ,
and provide strong support to the hypothesis, originally in
ferred from less direct studies with mammalian cells (24, 25),
that the cytotoxicity of the drug is due to its conversion of the
enzyme to a cytotoxic or dna-damaging agent. this mecha
nism of cell killing is further supported by the finding that yeast
cells become hypersensitive to  xxxd412xxx  when mutations
that abolish the rad52 repair pathway are introduced (24-27).

furthermore, because yeast cells devoid of dna topoisomerase
i are resistant to  xxxd412xxx , it follows directly that the en
 xxxg1282xxx  is the only significant cellular target of this antitumor
agent. replacement of the yeast topi gene encoding dna
topoisomerase i by its human counterpart has also made it
possible to use the yeast system in the screening of drugs that
specifically target the human enzyme. the same system has also
been used in the study of mutations in the human enzyme that
lead to alterations in sensitivity to  xxxd412xxx  (28).
dna  xxxg2312xxx , unlike topoisomerase i, is essential
for viability of yeast (29). therefore it is less straightforward to
demonstrate whether cell killing by a drug against this enzyme
is due to inactivation of the enzyme or due to its conversion to
a cytotoxic agent. the yeast strains we have developed are also
useful for studying anti- xxxg2312xxx  agents (24, 27). like
 xxxd412xxx ,  xxxd168xxx  induces high levels of recombination
(24), and rad52 mutants are hypersensitive to both etoposide
and mamsa2 (27). in this report, we show that yeast cells
overexpressing constitutively a plasmid-borne  xxxg2311xxx  gene en
coding dna  xxxg2312xxx  are hypersensitive to  xxxd168xxx 
and etoposide. these results support the notion that the mech
anism of cell killing by these  xxxg2312xxx -targeting agents
is unrelated to their inactivation of the enzyme; rather, similar
to cell killing by the  xxxg2310xxx  drug  xxxd412xxx ,
cytotoxicity of these agents is due to drug-mediated conversion
of dna  xxxg2312xxx  to a dna-damaging agent. because
human  xxxg2311xxx  gene can be expressed in a functional form in
yeast, the present system can also be adopted in the study of
mutations that affect drug sensitivity of the human enzyme.
materials

strains moderately overexpressing yeast dna  xxxg2312xxx  were
obtained by transformation of yeast with ycppdedlt2, in which
yeast  xxxg2311xxx  is expressed constitutively from pded1, the promoter of
yeast dedl, on a cenãœ
arsãœ
single copy plasmid. standard cloning
procedures were used to replace the pded1-linked gcn4 gene in
ycp88gcn4 (36) by  xxxg2311xxx . the gcn4 segment in between a hindlll
and an ecor\ site in ycp88gcn4 was first replaced by a polylinker
sequence consisted of the hindlu to bamh\ polylinker region of a
common cloning vector puc18 and a synthetic polylinker between
bamhl and ecorl, within which sites that are recognized by the re
striction endonucleases eagl, spel, and sfã®l
are also present. the  xxxg2311xxx 
region between hnm\\\ and the second bgl\\ site from it was then
excised from the yeast  xxxg2311xxx  clone piielol (29) and inserted into the
bamhl site of the ycp88gcn4 derivative, yielding ycppdedlt2.
measurement of drug sensitivity. drug sensitivity was measured as
previously described (24). briefly, cells were suspended in liquid ypda
or synthetic minimal media without uracil (sd-ura) at a titer of 2 x
106/ml. drug or the solvent used in the preparation of the drug stock
solution was added and the number of viable colonies was determined
as a function of time by plating appropriate dilutions of the cultures on
ypda plates. all viable colony numbers indicated are relative to that at
the time of drug addition.
measurement of  xxxg2312xxx  activity. crude cell extracts were
prepared by using glass bead lysis as previously described (37), except
that a bead-beater (bio-spec) was used instead of a vortex mixer. the
substrate for assaying the unknotting activity of dna  xxxg2312xxx 
was knotted phage p4 dna (38). activity was determined by adding an
extract or appropriate dilutions of it, as described previously (37). the
reaction mixtures were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis after
incubation at 30â°cfor 30 min. protein concentrations in cell extracts
were determined by the bradford method (39).

and methods

yeast strains. strains used in this study are listed in table 1. in
most cases, the starting strain was jn362a. isogenic  xxxg2311xxx -4 derivatives
were constructed by transformation of the parent strains with
pch1042, a plasmid carrying a segment in which the  xxxg2311xxx -4 alã-ele
resides, and a ura3 marker. the plasmid was linearized with restric
tion endonuclease kpn\, which cuts within the yeast  xxxg2311xxx -4 dna seg
ment, and ura3+ transformants arising from the integration of the
linear dna into the chromosomal  xxxg2311xxx  locus were selected (30).
these transformants were subsequently selected for uracil auxotrophy
with the use of 5-fluoroorotic acid. these arise from homologous re
combination between redundant  xxxg2311xxx  sequences flanking the uraãœ
marker, which deletes the intervening urai gene (31, 32). the tem
perature sensitivity of the ura~ derivatives so obtained was checked to
confirm the presence of the  xxxg2311xxx -4 mutation. isogenic rad52 derivatives
were constructed by transformation with ãÿamhi-digested psm20,
which carries a leu2 disruption of the rad52 gene (33). to verify the
effect of the  xxxg2311xxx -4 mutation, we converted the strain back to  xxxg2311xxx +
by using plasmid ycp7w2, which is a single copy plasmid that carries
yeast  xxxg2311xxx  under the control of its own promoter. all yeast transfor
mations were performed by using the lithium acetate method (34); in
some cases, the modification of schiestl and gietz (35) was adopted.

assay of dna  xxxg2312xxx  in extracts of cells harboring
ycppdedlt2
or ycpso showed that the presence of the
row-bearing plasmid increases the cellular level of dna to
poisomerase ii by approximately a factor of 10. in extracts of
cells harboring ycppdedlt2, dna  xxxg2312xxx  activity
measured by unknotting of knotted phage p4 dna is approx
imately 5-10 units/mg of cellular protein when cells were grown
in synthetic minimal media lacking uracil; while cells carrying a
ura3+ control plasmid ycpso grown under the same condi
tions have less than 1 unit of activity/mg of cellular protein.
extracts of cells carrying ycppdedlt2,
and grown in rich
broth (ypda) contained 10-20 units of dna  xxxg2312xxx 
per mgof cellular protein; extracts of cells carrying ycpso and
grown in broth contained 1-2 units of the enzyme per mg of
total protein. moderate overexpression of the enzyme from the
ded1 promoter has no apparent deleterious effects on growth
of rad52+ strains. in rad52 mutants, however, the presence of
ycppdedlt2 reduces the growth rate somewhat. previously,
the yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe was known to tolerate a
moderate level of overexpression of its  xxxg2311xxx  gene; in s. cerevisiae, overexpression of  xxxg2311xxx  from a fully induced gali gene
promoter on a multicopy plasmid leads to cell death (37).

poside (â€¢),or 200 mg/ml etoposide (d). the same strain with plasmid ycpso was
similarly treated with no drug (â€¢),or 200 mg/ml etoposide (a).

change in drug sensitivity was detectable when jn362a cells
were transformed with the control plasmids ycpso or ycppded1a, a derivative of ycppdedlt2 through the deletion of
the  xxxg2311xxx  sequences (data not shown). experiments with 5, 20,
or 50 mg/ml of  xxxd168xxx  showed a qualitatively similar increase
in sensitivity upon introduction of the 7w2-bearing plasmid
into the cells.
common laboratory strains of s. cerevisiae are insensitive to
the epipodophyllotoxins
etoposide ( xxxd2068xxx ) and  xxxd3309xxx 
( xxxd3309xxx ). even though strain jn362a carried the ise2 muta
tion, it is only weakly sensitive to etoposide [fig.3; see also
nitiss and wang (27)]. jn362a harboring ycppdedlt2,
however, exhibits a much higher level of sensitivity to etopo
side. in the presence of 100 mg/ml of the drug, arrest of growth
is seen with cells carrying the plasmid; killing of cells overexpressing dna  xxxg2312xxx  becomes evident at higher con
centrations of the drug (fig. 3).
as shown previously, inactivation of rad52, which is re
quired for the repair of double-stranded breaks in dna, greatly
increases sensitivity of cells to drugs that trap dna-dna to
poisomerase cleavable complexes (24, 25, 27). fig.4/4 shows
that strain jn394 ise2  xxxg2311xxx + rad52::leu2 harboring the
dna  xxxg2312xxx  overexpression plasmid ycppdedlt2
is extremely sensitive to  xxxd168xxx . at a drug concentration of
50 mg/ml, viable cell counts drop by 3 orders of magnitude after
10 h. in strains that do not carry ycppdedlt2, the same drug
concentration reduces the viable count by less than 2 orders of
magnitude (27). similarly, 50 mg/ml etoposide reduces viability
nearly 2 orders of magnitude when jn394 cells carry
ycppdedlt2 (fig. 4ã„),while relatively little cytotoxicity is
seen at that drug concentration when jn394 cells carry no
overexpressing plasmid (data not shown; see also fig.sa).

data depicted in fig. 5, a and b, show that jn394t2-4 appears
to be more resistant to etoposide that its top2jr sibling. since
the strains carrying the  xxxg2311xxx -4 mutation are temperature sen
sitive, both drug sensitivity experiments were performed at
26â°c.
when jn394t2-4 was transformed with a plasmid ycptop2,. a single-copy ycpso derivative carrying a wild-type
 xxxg2311xxx  gene expressed from its own promoter, the cells were
again found to be as sensitive to etoposide as jn394 ise2

growth rate on temperature; however, the growth temperatures

discussion
the results presented above show that sensitivity of yeast
cells to  xxxd168xxx  or etoposide changes with the cellular level of
dna  xxxg2312xxx : increasing the cellular concentration of
dna  xxxg2312xxx  by expressing constitutively a plasmidborne  xxxg2311xxx  gene greatly increases the sensitivity of the cells to
the drug. these results are entirely consistent with the hypoth
esis that the cellular target of the  xxxd168xxx  and etoposide fam
ilies of drugs is dna  xxxg2312xxx , and that these drugs kill
cells by converting dna  xxxg2312xxx  into a dna-damaging agent. the alternative interpretation, that cytotoxicity of
these drugs reflects their inactivation of an essential enzyme,
would predict the opposite outcome, namely that cells with a
lower level of the essential enzyme would be more sensitive to
the inhibitory action of the drugs. thus the mode of action of
dna topoisomerase h-targeting drugs of the  xxxd168xxx  and
etoposide type appears to be the same as that of the dna
topoisomerase i-targeting drug  xxxd412xxx .
the increase in sensitivity of yeast cells to a class of dna
topoisomerase h-targeting drugs, through the introduction of
mutations that affect drug permeability and dna repair and
moderate overexpression of the enzyme, facilitates the use of
yeast in the screening of such drugs. furthermore, because overexpression can be readily achieved by introducing a plasmidborne  xxxg2311xxx  gene, the system is readily adaptable to the expres
sion of heterospecific dna  xxxg2312xxx , such as the
human enzyme, so that drugs against dna  xxxg2312xxx  of
a particular organism could be screened in yeast. the ease of
sequence manipulations of a plasmid-borne gene also makes the
system reported here attractive for the identification of
mutations in  xxxg2311xxx  that would result in resistance or hypersensitivity of the enzyme to a particular drug.
the apparent resistance of yeast  xxxg2311xxx -4 cells but not their
 xxxg2311xxx + transformants to etoposide adds further evidence that
dna  xxxg2312xxx  is the only cellular target of the drug. in
terms of mechanistic studies of mutations that affect drug sen
sitivity, however, the coupling between enzyme activity and
drug sensitivity adds a degree of complexity. the observed eto

ii

poside resistance of  xxxg2311xxx -4 (fig. 5), for example, could be due
to fewer mutant dna  xxxg2312xxx  molecules per cell at
permissive temperatures, mutant enzyme molecules of a lower
specific activity inside cells, or a direct effect of the  xxxg2311xxx -4
mutation that alters drug-enzyme or enzyme-dna interac
tions. biochemical characterization of the mutant enzyme is
necessary to distinguish these possibilities. recently, mutations
have been identified in dna  xxxg2312xxx  from mamma
lian cell lines resistant to  xxxd168xxx  (20) or  xxxd3309xxx  (23); it
should be interesting to establish whether these mutations af
fect directly drug-enzyme and/or enzyme-dna interactions.
the strong dependence of sensitivity to dna topoisomerasetargeting drugs on intracellular concentrations of the target
enzyme is likely to be of clinical relevance. for examples, the
higher  xxxg2310xxx  levels in human colon cancer
xenographs in nude mice are believed to contribute to the effi
cacy of  xxxd412xxx  in the treatment of these tumors (44), and
the very low dna  xxxg2312xxx  level in chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes might be responsible for the inef
fectiveness of dna topoisomerase h-targeting drugs in the
treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (45). these and
other similar findings suggest that the effectiveness of a topoisomerase-targeting drug might be enhanced by treatments that
increase the cellular levels of dna topoisomerases.
