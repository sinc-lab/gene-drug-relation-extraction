prostaglandin (pg) e2 exerts its actions by acting on a group
of g-protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs). there are four gpcrs
responding to pge2 designated subtypes ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and
 xxxg1875xxx  and multiple splicing isoforms of the subtype ep3. the ep
subtypes exhibit differences in signal transduction, tissue localization, and regulation of expression. this molecular and biochemical heterogeneity of pge receptors leads to pge2 being
the most versatile prostanoid. studies on knock-out mice deficient in each ep subtype have defined pge2 actions mediated by
each subtype and identified the role each ep subtype plays in
various physiological and pathophysiological responses. here
we review recent advances in pge receptor research.

prostanoids including various prostaglandins (pgs)2 and
thromboxanes ( xxxg2254xxx ) are cyclooxygenase (cox) metabolites of
c20-unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  such as  xxxd208xxx . these
substances are synthesized in response to various stimuli in a
variety of cells, released immediately after synthesis, and act in
the vicinity of their synthesis to maintain local homeostasis (1).
among prostanoids, the e type pgs, particularly pge2 derived
from  xxxd208xxx , is most widely produced in the body,
most widely found in animal species, and exhibits the most
versatile actions. receptors mediating prostanoid actions were
characterized first by pharmacological analysis, which indicated the presence of one receptor each, named dp, fp, ip, and
tp, for pgs of the d, f, and i types and txa, respectively, and
four different receptors designated ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  for
the e type pgs (reviewed in refs. 2 and 3). molecular identification of these receptors was achieved by their cdna cloning,
which revealed that the prostanoid receptors are g-proteincoupled receptors (gpcrs) and that there is indeed a family of
eight gpcrs that correspond to the pharmacologically defined
receptors. in addition, a recent study revealed the presence of
the ninth prostanoid receptor that belongs not to the prostanoid receptor family described above but to the chemoattractant
receptor family (4). this receptor called  xxxg1871xxx  or dp2 is
expressed in th2 cells and eosinophils and mediates some of
the  xxxg1073xxx  actions on these cells such as chemotaxis. cdna

cloning also revealed the presence of several splicing variants
for ep3. thus, there are four gpcrs designated subtypes ep1,
 xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  and ep3 variants mediating pge2 actions.
subsequent analysis has revealed distinct biochemical properties and tissue and cellular localization of each ep subtype. the
cloned ep subtypes have also been used in the development of
compounds specific to each subtype.

biochemical properties of pge receptor subtypes and
isoforms
molecular structures—fig. 1 shows an alignment of the primary amino acid sequences of the mouse ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , and  xxxg1875xxx  and
three isoforms of mouse ep3 receptors. the mouse ep1,  xxxg1873xxx , ep3
(ep3␣), and  xxxg1875xxx  receptors consist of 405, 362, 366, and 513 amino
acids, respectively.  xxxg1875xxx  has the longest intracellular c terminus
and a relatively long intracellular third loop. the  xxxg1872xxx  also
has a long third loop, whereas the  xxxg1873xxx  and ep3 receptors have a
more compact structure. a remarkable feature distinguishing the
 xxxg1874xxx  from the other ep receptors is the existence of multiple variants generated by alternative splicing of the c-terminal
tail. in mouse, alternative splicing creates three ep3 splice isoforms, ␣, ␤, and ␥, containing c-terminal tails of 30, 26, and 29
amino acids that do not share any structural motifs or hydrophobic features (5, 6). these isoforms show similar ligand binding
properties but have different signal transduction properties as
described below. multiple splice isoforms for ep3 also exist in
other species including rat, rabbit, bovine, and human (3).
although all of the four ep subtypes respond to pge2, the amino
acid identity among the eps is limited; the identity of ep1 to  xxxg1873xxx ,
ep3, and  xxxg1875xxx  is 30, 33, and 28%, respectively. the amino acid
identity is only 31% even between the two eps ( xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx ) that
couple to the activation of adenylate cyclase. the  xxxg1873xxx  is
more homologous to ip (40%) and dp (44%), the other two adenylate cyclase-stimulatory prostanoid receptors, than any other eps,
and the  xxxg1872xxx  is more homologous to fp (35%) and tp
(34%) than other eps. this limited homology among eps probably
reflects the phylogenetic relationship among the prostanoid
receptors (7).
ligand binding properties—the ep subtypes bind most
potently to pge2 with kd values in the range of 1– 40 nm.  xxxd2331xxx , an ip agonist, also binds to ep1 and ep3 with ki values of
about 20 nm. the pge analogs that have been used in conventional studies are not specific for any given ep subtype except
butaprost, which is specific for  xxxg1873xxx . several compounds highly
selective for each ep subtype have been developed using cultured cell lines stably expressing each subtype. examples are
shown in fig. 2 (8 –11).
signal transduction properties—signal transduction pathways of ep subtypes have been studied by examining agonistinduced changes in second messengers such as camp, ca2⫹,
and inositol phosphates and agonist-induced changes in
activities of downstream kinases. the  xxxg1872xxx  mediates
a pge2-induced elevation of the free ca2⫹ concentration in
chinese hamster ovary cells. this increase is dependent on
extracellular ca2⫹ and occurs without a detectable phosjournal of biological chemistry

1). of interest in this respect is the
presence of two eps,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx ,
that are coupled to increases in
camp. they apparently function
redundantly in some processes.
for example, both  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx 
mediate induction of rankl
through camp by pge2 in osteoclastogenesis,
although
the
extent of the contribution by each
receptor may be different (14, 15).
on the other hand, there are processes in which  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  play
distinct roles. some of these may
be because of selective expression
of either of them in relevant cells
such as the action of  xxxg1873xxx  during
cumulus expansion in ovulation
and fertilization (16) and that of

regulates migration of dendritic
cells in the mouse although both
 xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  are expressed in
these cells (18). this  xxxg1875xxx -selective
action may be related to the fact
that  xxxg1875xxx  but not  xxxg1873xxx  couples to
phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase,
probably via gi, in addition to activation of adenylate cyclase (19, 20). it is
interesting in this respect that  xxxg1875xxx  is
also implicated in cell migration during tumor invasion (21) for ductus
arteriosus closure (22) and for
zebrafish gastrulation (23). as
described, the  xxxg1874xxx  consists
of multiple isoforms generated by
alternative splicing of the c-terminal
tail. functional differences among
these splice variants have been
reported, including coupling to diffigure 2. structures of  xxxd1903xxx  and ep-selective agonists and antagonists. the ki values (nm) of ferent signal transduction pathways

the kidney, lung, and stomach, and  xxxg1873xxx  is the least abundant of the
ep receptors. within tissues, each ep subtype shows a distinct
cellular localization. for example, in the kidney, ep3 is expressed
in the tubular epithelium, the thick ascending limb, and the cortical collecting ducts in the outer medulla, ep1 in the papillary collecting ducts, and  xxxg1875xxx  in the glomerulus (33) (fig. 3b). this distribution pattern appears to correlate with the pge2-mediated
regulation of ion transport, water reabsorption, and glomerular
filtration, respectively. a similar distribution of eps in the kidney
has been reported in the rabbit and human (34, 35). these analyses
did not detect signals for  xxxg1873xxx  mrna in the kidney.
regulation of expression—expression of ep genes is regulated
by various physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. in peritoneal resident macrophages (36) and a macrophage cell line, j774.1
(37),  xxxg1875xxx  is expressed under basal conditions. the addition of
lipopolysaccharide (lps) induces  xxxg1873xxx  expression markedly in
both types of cells but enhances the  xxxg1875xxx  expression only slightly in
j774.1 cells and suppresses the expression of  xxxg1875xxx  in the resident
macrophages (36). macrophages produce a large amount of pge2
in response to lps, and suppression of the  xxxg1875xxx  expression in the
resident macrophages was prevented by treatment with indoapril 20, 2007 • volume 282 • number 16

 xxxd2817xxx  and was mimicked by the addition of dibutyryl camp or
pge2 but not butaprost, suggesting that  xxxg1875xxx  expression is regulated through a negative feedback loop. the presence of  xxxg1873xxx  and
 xxxg1875xxx  and augmentation of their expression by lps stimulation were
also seen in the raw 264.7 murine macrophage-like cell line (38).
quantitative reverse transcription-pcr analysis indicated a 3-fold
increase in  xxxg1875xxx  mrna 2.5 h after lps stimulation. in thioglycolate-elicited macrophages, macrophage engagement with extracellular matrix induces expression of both  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  and
cox-2 in a mapkerk1/2-dependent manner (39).
in female reproductive organs such as the ovary and uterus,
hormonal exposure induces expression of the ep subtypes in specific cell types. in the ovary, the  xxxg1875xxx  expression is found in oocytes
in preantral follicles. upon gonadotropin stimulation, this expression disappears, and  xxxg1875xxx  is expressed first in both granulosa cells
and cumulus cells and then only in granulosa cells in preovulatory
follicles.  xxxg1873xxx  expression is found in both granulosa cells and cumulus cells in preantral follicles. this expression increases upon gonadotropin stimulation and becomes confined to the cumulus cells
just before ovulation. interestingly, cox-2 expression changes in
a similar pattern to  xxxg1873xxx  upon gonadotropin stimulation in cumulus and mural granulosa cells (40). in the uterus, when mice are
primed with gonadotropins and undergo pseudopregnancy,  xxxg1873xxx  is
transiently expressed on day 5 in luminal epithelial cells.  xxxg1875xxx 
expression is limited to luminal epithelial cells on day 0, sharply
increases on day 3, and is then found in endometrial stromal cells
as well as glandular epithelium. ep3 expression is found in longitudinal muscle layer before stimulation. after stimulation, this
expression disappears and ep3 is expressed in circular smooth
muscles with a further increase on days 3 and 5 (41).
promoter analysis has been done for  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx . several consensus sequences relevant to inflammatory stimuli such as those
for nf- xxxg1181xxx , nf␬b, and ap2 are found, and several regions responsive to progesterone have been characterized in the promoter
region of the  xxxg1873xxx  gene (42). the promoter region of the  xxxg1875xxx  gene
contains several putative cis-acting elements such as sites for  xxxg1222xxx ,
ap2, sp1, nf␬b, myod, and nf- xxxg1181xxx  as well as a putative glucocorticoid response element. functional analysis detected an lps/serum-responsive region between ⫺554 and ⫺116 bp (38).

physiological functions of ep subtypes
mice deficient in each ep subtype individually have been
generated, and studies using these knock-out mice and subtype-specific ep agonists/antagonists have identified ep subtypes mediating various pge2 actions (table 2). ep subtypes
mediate many processes known to be inhibited by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). for example, the ep3
receptor mediates generation of pyrogenic fever (54), and ep1

and ep3 signals converge at the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus and mediate neuroendocrine stress response by
facilitating release of  xxxg517xxx  (43).
 xxxg1873xxx  facilitates ovulation and fertilization by inducing expansion of the cumulus, thus clarifying the mechanism for the
inhibitory effect of nsaids on ovulation (16). other studies
have revealed that different ep subtypes as well as the  xxxg1879xxx  function in hyperalgesia both at the periphery and in the
cns. for example, the acetic acid writhing test revealed the
involvement of both ip and ep3 in hyperalgesia (57, 61). pain
sensation that is induced by ph and heat and mediated by the
 xxxg2335xxx  trpv1 is augmented by pge2 and pgi2 acting on ep1 and ip, respectively (46). furthermore, in the spinal
cord, pge2 acting on  xxxg1873xxx  in glycinergic neurons abolishes the
glycine-induced tonic inhibition of pain neuron in the dorsal
horn and facilitates the propagation of nociceptive signals
through the spinal cord to higher areas of the cns (48).
prostanoids, particularly pge2, have been thought to play a
major role in acute inflammation by acting on the peripheral circulation and inducing hyperemia and swelling. one of the lessons
learned from the knock-out mouse studies, however, is that prostanoids including pge2 exert both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses, and these actions are often produced
through regulation of gene expression in relevant tissues. for
example, consistent with the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic
effect of nsaids,  xxxg1873xxx  and  xxxg1875xxx  (and ip) redundantly mediate
development of collagen-induced arthritis (49). intriguingly, however, the pro-inflammatory actions of these prostanoid receptors
are elicited mainly by induction of arthritis-associated genes in the
joint. as for inflammatory swelling, studies using the carrageenininduced paw edema model revealed involvement of ip (61), and

11616 journal of biological chemistry

those using carrageenin-induced pleurisy revealed participation of
 xxxg1873xxx , ep3, and ip in inflammatory exudation (62). anti-inflammatory actions of prostanoids are seen typically in allergic or immune
inflammation and are usually balanced by pro-inflammatory
actions of other prostanoids. this may explain why nsaids are
without effects on allergy and immune responses. examples are
the antagonism between the  xxxg1073xxx -dp (63) and the pge2-ep3
(55) pathways in elicitation of allergic asthma. dp and ep3 are both
present in the airway epithelium, and activation of the latter suppresses expression of a series of allergy-related genes and progression of allergic inflammation. knock-out mice studies have also
revealed that prostanoids work at multiple steps in hapten-induced immune responses. interestingly, most of these actions are
found in the immunization and not in the elicitation process. the
 xxxg1073xxx -dp pathway suppresses (64) and the pge2- xxxg1875xxx  pathway
facilitates (18) mobilization, migration, and maturation of langerhans cells in the skin, and the txa2-tp pathway negatively modulates interaction between activated langerhans cells and naı̈ve
t-cells, thereby suppressing t-cell proliferation and differentiation (65). pge2 together with other prostanoids can thus modulate
various steps of inflammation in a context-dependent manner and
coordinate the whole process in both pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory directions.

concluding remarks
the mechanisms whereby pge2 exerts its pleiotropic effects,
once a mystery in physiology, have been clarified through the
biochemical identification and cdna cloning of the four ep
subtype receptors. furthermore, development of highly selective agonists and antagonists to each ep subtype and information obtained by studies on mice deficient in each ep receptor
now provide opportunities to apply our knowledge to manipulate various pge2-mediated pathological processes.
