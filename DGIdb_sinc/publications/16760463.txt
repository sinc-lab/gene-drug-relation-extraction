human granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx 
(gm-csf)3 is a key cytokine in host defense regulation, and the
gm-csf receptor (gmr) is expressed on hematopoietic precursors, in mature host defense cells, and in certain non-hematopoietic tissues (1– 4). the high affinity receptor for gm-csf
is composed of an ␣ subunit (␣gmr) that binds ligand with low
affinity and a ␤ subunit (␤gmr) that does not bind gm-csf on
its own (5– 8). although the ␤gmr initiates most gm-csfinduced signaling pathways, the short intracellular domain (54

amino acids) of ␣gmr is required for gmr signaling (9 –12).
we and others have used genetic and biochemical approaches
to find proteins interacting with ␣gmr, and several proteins
were identified with different functional implications (13–15).
there is a soluble isoform of ␣gmr as well as an ␣2 isoform
(␣2gmr) derived from alternative mrna splicing (16, 17). the
␣2gmr has a different cytoplasmic domain but generally
exhibits similar properties to ␣gmr in the cooperation with
␤gmr (17). unlike the ␣gmr, the ␣2gmr is not up-regulated
in granulocyte/macrophage (g/m) lineages, and the ␣2gmr
appears to be more relevant in undifferentiated hematopoietic
progenitor cells (18). signaling of gm-csf through ␣2gmr/
␤gmr leads to more erythroid differentiation than through
␣gmr/␤gmr, suggesting that the receptor isoforms could
guide cell differentiation (18).
c-kit is a  xxxg1608xxx   xxxg2198xxx  that regulates the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic
stem cells, erythropoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis
(19 –22). stem cell factor (scf, also known as kit ligand or steel
factor) is the ligand for c-kit. the intracellular region of c-kit
has two kinase domains separated by a kinase insert (23, 24).
scf binding to c-kit induces receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation, leading to activation of downstream signaling
pathways (25). in mice, c-kit is encoded at the white spotting
(w) locus, its ligand scf is encoded at the steel (sl) locus, and
mutations at the w or the sl locus lead to sterility, pigment cell
deficiency, and macrocytic anemia (26).
c-kit and ␣gmr are well known markers of differentiation,
especially in hematopoietic cells. starting with a high level of
c-kit and negligible amount of ␣gmr, hematopoietic stem or
progenitor cells down-regulate c-kit and up-regulate ␣gmr
when they enter into the g/m lineage (22, 27). the receptor
subunits are generally deemed as passively regulated adaptor
molecules, and a direct interaction between ␣gmr and c-kit
has not been reported. using our preliminary computational
method for predicting protein interactions, we identified c-kit
as a possible interacting protein for ␣gmr. here we describe
how the ␣gmr/c-kit physical interaction regulates signal initiation of the receptors and how ␣2gmr is different from
␣gmr on modulating c-kit signaling.

the cytokine granulocyte-macrophage  xxxg526xxx  (gm-csf) regulates hematopoiesis and the function of mature
host defense cells through the gm-csf receptor (gmr), which is
composed of ␣ (␣gmr) and ␤ (␤gmr) subunits. stem cell factor is
another important hematopoietic cytokine that signals through
c-kit, a receptor  xxxg2198xxx , and regulates hematopoietic stem
cell maintenance and erythroid development. like other cytokine
receptors, gmr and c-kit are generally deemed as independent
adaptor molecules capable of transducing cytokine-specific signals. we found that the ␣gmr directly interacts with c-kit and
that the interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic domains. furthermore, ␣gmr inhibited c-kit auto-phosphorylation induced
by the ligand stem cell factor. consistent with the inhibitory effect,
the expression of ␣gmr was suppressed in cells whose viability
was dependent on c-kit signaling. in contrast, the alternatively
spliced ␣2 isoform of the ␣gmr could not inhibit c-kit signaling,
providing a rationale for the existence of the ␣2 isoform. our
results suggest that in addition to having the commonly appreciated roles in cytokine signal transduction, the receptors ␣gmr and
c-kit could interact to coordinate their signal initiation.

found to be a likely interaction partner with the ␣gmr peptide in reverse orientation (fig. 1a). since the sequences of
human, mouse, and  xxxd2755xxx  c-kit have a very high degree of
similarity (fig. 1b), we tested the interaction between human
␣gmr and mouse c-kit in co-immunoprecipitation experiments. when co-expressed in 293t cells, human ␣gmr was
co-immunoprecipitated with mouse c-kit (fig. 1c). we also
made a construct with 256 amino acids (kit256) from the c
terminus of mouse c-kit that contains the putative ␣gmrinteracting domain and found that kit256 was co-immunoprecipitated with ␣gmr when co-expressed in 293t cells
(fig. 1d). therefore the ␣gmr and c-kit appeared to interact through their intracellular domains.

agmr inhibits c-kit auto-phosphorylation induced by scf—
the physical interaction between c-kit and ␣gmr suggested
cooperation or cross-inhibition between scf/c-kit and
gm-csf/␣␤gmr signaling. binding of ␣gmr to c-kit, most
likely to the kinase insert domain, implied that ␣gmr could
modulate c-kit kinase activity, and therefore we investigated
whether ␣gmr influenced c-kit kinase activity in 293t cells
expressing mouse c-kit and human ␣gmr. mouse scf stimulated time- and dose-dependent phosphorylation of c-kit in
293t cells transfected only with c-kit as detected by anti- xxxd1075xxx  antibody (fig. 2). when cells were co-transfected
with ␣gmr and c-kit, the phosphorylation of c-kit induced by
scf was clearly inhibited (fig. 2). this result suggested an
inhibitory function of the ␣gmr/c-kit interaction.
scf/c-kit-maintained cells restrict ␣gmr expression—we
asked whether ␣gmr could inhibit c-kit signaling in the
human hematopoietic cell line tf-1 that responds to growth
factors such as scf, gm-csf,  xxxg1177xxx , or erythropoietin
(29). scf stimulation through human c-kit maintains the viability and proliferation of tf-1 cells, providing a good model of
human c-kit signaling for testing the ␣gmr inhibitory activity.
we generated retroviral expression vectors for ␣gmr, ␣2gmr

retrovirus infection of k562 cells
with variations in expression levels and infection percentages, possibly reflecting different amounts
of retroviruses delivered (fig. 3b).

␣gmr inhibited c-kit and ␣gmr-375 partially inhibited c-kit
(fig. 3c).
exogenous ␣gmr expression in tf-1 cells inhibits endogenous scf/c-kit signaling—we further attempted to achieve
the expression of ␣gmr and ␣2gmr in tf-1 cells and test
whether exogenously expressed ␣gmr could inhibit endogenous c-kit signaling. to allow expression of ␣gmr in tf-1
cells, another growth factor, gm-csf, was included in addition
to scf, relieving the viability dependence on scf/c-kit signaling. we noticed under a microscope that the addition of  xxxg526xxx  to scf caused a significant tf-1 cell size increase and that
the bigger cells could be driven back to smaller size in culture
with scf alone, quantifiable in the flow cytometry forward
scatter/side scatter (fsc/ssc) plot (fig. 4a). if tf-1 cells
express a protein inhibitor of scf/c-kit signaling, scf should
be unable to drive enlarged cells to smaller cells. therefore we
used the cell population ratio of the lower left quadrant (ll,
smaller cells) to the lower right quadrant (lr, bigger cells) from

our present study defines a molecular interaction between
the ␣gmr and c-kit, which is quite unique in that it involves a
receptor  xxxg2198xxx  and a non-kinase receptor subunit.
the c-kit kinase insert domain is known to bind phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (24), suggesting that it is a domain accessible
for interaction with other proteins, and therefore it is understandable that the ␣gmr/c-kit interaction utilizes their intracellular domains.
our findings suggest that the inhibition of c-kit signaling
by ␣gmr is a result of direct receptor-receptor modulation.
not only could we roughly confirm the predicted interaction
domains, we also demonstrated that ␣gmr inhibited c-kit
auto-phosphorylation in 293t cells with protein overexpression. auto-phosphorylation is an early step in c-kit signaling
pathways, indicating that the inhibition is at the receptor level.
if the inhibition occurred indirectly, i.e. through a third party
mediator, the would-be mediator also needs to reach overexpression level to overtake c-kit. it is very unlikely that 293t
cells would happen to have such a mediator at that high level

ratio would indicate a higher
response. we identified cells positive with ␣gmr, ␣gmr-375,
␣gmr-356, and ␣2gmr with an
anti-␣gmr antibody in flow cytometry (fig. 4b) and analyzed their
fsc/ssc plots (fig. 4c). ␣2gmrand ␣gmr-356-positive cells had
an ll/lr ratio similar to non-infected cells (low fluorescence population) (fig. 4, c and d), indicating
that ␣2gmr and ␣gmr-356 did
not inhibit scf/c-kit signaling.
␣gmr-375 partially inhibited scf

strongest inhibition (fig. 4, c and

the expression of human ␣gmr but

not shown). the incompatibility of ␣gmr expression in
cd34⫹ cells probably reflects the importance of c-kit signaling
for the maintenance of cd34⫹ cells (22). the suppression of
␣gmr expression in c-kit signaling-dependent cells suggested
that some differentiation markers can be naturally incompatible in hematopoietic stem cells, providing the stem cells a possible maintenance mechanism.
although the ␣gmr-expressing g/m lineage cells come
from the c-kit-expressing hematopoietic stem or progenitor
cells, intermediate cells with both c-kit and ␣gmr are rare
(27), suggesting that the intermediate cells only exist for a short
duration during differentiation. therefore a natural cell system
with both ␣gmr and c-kit was mechanistically not readily
available for us to demonstrate the endogenous ␣gmr/c-kit
association. nevertheless, it can be inferred from our results
that overexpression of ␣gmr is not required for inhibiting
endogenous c-kit signaling since scf-supplemented tf-1 cells
could only allow very little ␣gmr expression, suggesting that
the amount of ␣gmr needed for inhibiting tf-1 endogenous
c-kit signaling is very low.
in summary, our studies showed that the ␣gmr could
interact with c-kit and inhibit c-kit signaling, but ␣2gmr
could not inhibit c-kit signaling. the receptors ␣gmr and
c-kit are more than regulated adaptor molecules for transducing cytokine signals; rather, they are signal regulators in
their own right.

induced by ␣gmr; therefore the ␣gmr and c-kit interaction
appears to be direct. our data do not exclude the possibility that
␣gmr binding to c-kit affects scf binding. direct receptorreceptor trans-modulations are probably not rare as there are
other examples including the  xxxg1398xxx  met inhibition of fas signaling and the 67-kda laminin
receptor inhibition of gm-csf receptor signaling (15, 32).
as a measurement for scf-induced cellular responses, we
utilized an observation that scf-supplemented tf-1 cells were
smaller than gm-csf-supplemented cells. the reduction of
tf-1 cell size with scf/c-kit signaling is consistent with previous reports that c-kit signaling-deficient mice had severe macrocytic anemia, in which the average size of erythrocytes was
larger than normal (21, 26).
the expressions of ␣gmr and ␣2gmr at the mrna level
were studied during cd34⫹ hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, and it was found that the ratio of ␣2gmr to
␣gmr was about 30 – 60-fold higher in undifferentiated hematopoietic cells (c-kit positive) than in cells of g/m lineages
(c-kit negative) (18). this implies that the biological function of
the alternatively spliced ␣2 isoform is to transduce gm-csf
signal in the presence of c-kit. both ␣gmr and ␣2gmr can
cooperate with ␤gmr to transduce gm-csf signals, and thus,
their differential effects on c-kit signaling might be an important biological reason for the existence of the receptor isoforms.
as an inhibitor for c-kit signaling, ␣gmr would be expected
to interfere with biological processes in which c-kit is known to
be important, such as erythropoiesis. it was found that expression of human ␣gmr, but not ␤gmr or  xxxg1177xxx  receptor
␣ subunit, in avian primary erythroblasts actively inhibited
their outgrowth and erythroid differentiation, in which  xxxg718xxx  and c-kit are involved (33). ␣gmr in those
erythroblasts appeared to have induced changes reflective of
the anemic phenotype in c-kit-deficient mice, substantiating that ␣gmr is a c-kit inhibitor. another finding indicated
that the signaling of gm-csf through ␣2gmr/␤gmr leads to
more erythroid differentiation and less g/m differentiation
than through ␣gmr/␤gmr in fdcp-mix cells (18). our theory could potentially account for the observed differences in
that ␣2gmr allows c-kit signaling and permits both erythroid
and g/m differentiations, whereas ␣gmr inhibits c-kit signaling and permits predominantly g/m differentiation. using
␣gmr in the g/m lineage and c-kit in the erythroid lineage,
hematopoietic cells could ensure lineage divisions because the
␣gmr and c-kit signaling pathways are intrinsically non-coexistent. the regulation of hematopoiesis has been extensively
studied, and there are other known hematopoietic lineage
regulators such as transcription factors pu.1 and ccaat/
enhancer binding protein ␣ (c/ebp␣) (34, 35). ␣gmr and
c-kit are quite special because these receptors were not previously known to coordinate their own signaling patterns.
we attempted to use the retroviral vectors to express ␣gmr
and its variants in purified human bone marrow cd34⫹ cells
and investigate whether ␣gmr could influence lineage differentiation in colony formation assays. the cd34⫹ cells supplemented with scf, gm-csf,  xxxg1177xxx , and erythropoietin
could express ␣2gmr, ␣gmr-375, and ␣gmr-356 but not
␣gmr in 24 h, similar to scf-supplemented tf-1 cells (data
