abstract.  xxxd1787xxx  ([- xxxd1787xxx , mea) is a naturally occurring sulfhydryl compound that depletes pitu-
itary prl, causes a reduction in brain and gut somatostatin (srif), and suppresses norepinephrine (ne) and epinephrine
(epi) synthesis by inhibition of dopamine-f-hydroxylase (dbh). srif inhibits gh and tsh secretion, whereas, ne and
epi facilitate their release. the objectives of this investigation were to: (1) determine the dose-response and time course of
dbh inhibition by mea in vivo and in vitro, and correlate these findings with mea tissue levels, and (2) assess the
function of srif and ne/epi in regulation of episodic gh and tsh secretion using mea. animals were administered
mea (75-300 mg/kg, s.c.) and hypothalamic levels of dopamine (da), ne, epi, serotonin (5-ht) and mea were meas-
ured by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) and electrochemical detection. dbh activity was measured in
vitro after exposure to mea +  xxxd2684xxx  (nemi). chronically cannulated rats were administered mea (100 or
300 mg/kg) and serial blood samples were removed in undisturbed animals, and after 30 min swimming stress. cannulated
rats with bilateral lesions of the ventromedial/arcuate nuclei (vmn/arc) were administered mea (150 mg/kg). mea
caused a dose-related decrease in ne/epi and in increase in da at doses > 150 mg/kg. tissue mea was highest at 4 h
(679 + 64 pm/mg tissue), but still measureable after 24 h. mea inhibited dbh in vitro (95% inhibition  xxxd1891xxx -) m); nemi
blocked inhibition. stress-induced gh supression and corticosterone release were partially blocked by a low dose of mea
(100 mg/kg). immediately after stress, plasma levels of gh and tsh increased; but this response was blocked by a high
dose of mea (300 mg/kg). mea increased basal gh levels, but did not restore episodic gh, and lowered prl in vmn/
arc-lesioned animals. these results indicate that: (1) ne/epi facilitate episodic gh and tsh release, (2) srif main-
tains low basal levels of gh and tsh, (3) mea-induced prl depletion does not involve da systems and (4) mea can be
measured in tissue relatively simply using hplc and electrochemical detection.

49], led to the use of this thiol in studies designed to deter-
mine the function of somatostatin in the regulation of
growth hormone (gh) and  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) secretion
[24, 25].

inhibition of episodic gh secretion in the rat [40] by
central somatostatinergic systems is thought to be responsi-
ble for low plasma gh levels (troughs) between peaks, and
stress-induced gh suppression [2, 5, 6, 13, 20, 42, 46, 47].
gh secretory episodes are believed to be generated by hy-
pothalamic gh-releasing factor (grf) neurons in the arcu-
ate/ventromedial nuclear complex (arc/vmn) [23]
which project to the median eminence and are activated by
noradrenergic and adrenergic (epi) inputs [9, 20, 44, 45, 50].
recent studies provided further evidence in support of this

hypothesis by showing that high doses of mea (300 mg/
kg), which lowered hypothalamic somatostatin and ne,
elevated trough levels of gh, suppressed episodic release
and attenuated gh suppression induced by immobilization
stress [25]. a lower mea dose (90 mg/kg) also elevated gh
trough levels and lowered hypothalamic somatostatin, but
did not significantly affect gh secretory bursts nor hypo-
thalamic ne content.

somatostatin and the catecholamines also influence thy-
rotropin (tsh) secretion by the anterior pituitary gland [1,
5, 13, 18, 20, 29, 41, 42, 46, 50]. somatostatin inhibits basal,
 xxxg2328xxx  (trh)- and cold-induced
tsh release [1, 5, 18, 29], whereas dopamine (da) inhibits
and ne and epi enhance tsh release [7, 10].  xxxd1787xxx 
(90 and 300 mg/kg) caused a rapid decline in plasma tsh
levels without affecting hypothalamic trh or trh-
induced tsh release [24]. the plasma tsh response to the
lower mea dose is difficult to explain because neither hy-
pothalamic ne nor epi decreased significantly.

the overall objective of this investigation was to deter-
mine the mechanism(s) by which mea disrupts neuroendo-
crine regulation of gh and tsh. to this end, the following
experiments were performed: (1) the effects of mea on the
plasma gh, tsh and corticosterone responses to swim-
ming stress; (2) the plasma gh and prl responses to mea.
(300 mg/kg) in arc/vmn-lesioned animals; (3) dose-re-
sponse and time course correlations between hypothalamic
levels of monoamines and mea, and (4) the effects of mea.

methods

animals

male sprague-dawley rats (275-350 g, charles river breeding
co., portage, mich.) were housed in temperature- and humidity-
controlled laboratories with a 12:12 h light-dark cycle (lights on at
06.00). the animals were given free access to laboratory chow and
water.

drugs and reagents

 xxxd1787xxx  hcl and cysteine hcl (sigma chemical co.,
st.louis, mo.) were dissolved in distilled water just before injec-
tion, adjusted to ph 7.4 with 1. on naoh, and administered, sub-
cutaneously, in a volume of 2 ml/kg body weight. doses are ex-
pressed as mg of the hci salt. isosmotic nacl was used as the
control injection.

norepinephrine, da, epi, dihydroxyphenylacetic acid
(dopa), and serotonin (5-ht) were obtained from bioanalytical
systems inc. (west lafayette, ind.); catalase,  xxxd2684xxx ,
tyramine, fumarate, octopamine,  xxxd2850xxx ,  xxxd228xxx  and
dbh were from sigma chemical co.; decyl and octyl sodium sul-
fates were from eastman kodak (rochester, n.y.); monochloro-
acetic acid and hplc grade methanol and acetonitrile were from
fisher scientific co. (fairlawn, n.j.).

 

cannulation and blood sampling

chronic indwelling cannulae were placed in the right atrium
via the right external jugular vein and animals were adapted to iso-
lation test chambers by methods described previously [46]. blood
sampling began after the recovery of the preoperative body weight
(usually 1 week postoperatively). blood samples were withdrawn
every 15 min and immediately centrifuged, as described earlier [46],
the plasma was frozen (-80 °c) until radioimmunoassay of gh.
tsh, prl or corticosterone.

in vivo experiments

experiment 1: effects of mea on the gh, tsh and corticoste-
rone responses to swimming stress. cannulated rats were admin
tered mea (100 or 300 mg/kg), cysteine (300 mg/kg) or isosmotic
saline at 09.00 and sampled for 6 h beginning  xxxd1891xxx .00. they were
placed in a 25°c water bath  xxxd1891xxx .30 and forced to swim for 30
min, after which they were returned to their isolation cages.
growth hormone, tsh and corticosterone were assayed in each
plasma sample.

experiment 2: effects of mea on gh and prl in animals with
bilateral lesions of the arc/vmn. animals were anesthetized with
chloral hydrate and placed in a stoelting stereotaxic apparatus,
with the top of the incisor bar 23 mm from the surface of the animal
platform. bilateral thermal lesions (60°c x 60 s) were placed in
the arc/vmn nuclei. the coordinates were 6.2 mm anterior to
the interauricular line, 8.9 mm ventral to the dural surface, and 0.5
mm lateral to the midline. for sham-operated animals, the elec-
trode was lowered 4 mm beneath the dural surface for 60 s and no
heat was applied. the animals were cannulated immediately after
placement of the lesions. after recovery from surgery (7-10 days),
animals were administered isosmotic nacl at 9.00 on day | and
mea (150 mg/kg) on day 3; blood samples were removed for 5-6 h
beginning  xxxd1891xxx .00, subsequently, animals were sacrificed and their
brains were examined for lesion placement by standard histologi-
cal methods.

experiment 3: effects of mea on hypothalamic somatostatin
and  xxxg2240xxx . animals were administered isosmotic nacl or
mea (100 and 300 mg/kg) and sacrificed 4 h later by decapitation.
their brains were rapidly removed and the hypothalamic region
was dissected using the following landmarks: anteriorly, anterior
border of the optic chiasm; posteriorly, mammillary bodies; later-
ally, hypothalamic sulci and at a depth, of 1.5-2.0 mm. the tissue
was weighed, placed in 1.0 n hcl, sonicated, and the supernatant
was frozen (-80 °c) until radioimmunoassay of somatostatin and
 xxxg2240xxx .

experiment 4: hypothalamic and adrenal levels of mea and
monoamines; dose-response and time course studies, animals
were administered isosmotic nacl or mea (75, 150, and 300 mg/
kg) and sacrificed at 0 and 4h for the dose-response study, and at 0,
2, 4, 6and 24 h for the time course study. hypothalami and adrenal
glands were dissected, weighed, placed in 0.1 m hcios, sonicated
and centrifuged. supernatants and pellets were refrigerated (4 °c)
for determination of mea, da, ne, epi, dopa, 5-ht and total
protein.

the sulfhydryl group of these agents inactivates dbh by chelation
of its copper ions in situ [30, 31],  xxxd2684xxx , which reacts
with sulfhydryl groups [30], was added to show reversal of this pro-
cess. dbh activity was measured using a modification of the the
method of nagatsu and udenfriend [31]. the assay is based on the
enzymatic conversion of tyramine to octopamine, which is then ox-
idized to p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and detected photometrically.
the standard reaction mixture (0.9 ml total volume) contained 150.

or distilled h20, 50 «l of 0.2 m disodium fumarate, 50 ul 0.2 m
 xxxd228xxx  and 200 ul of a mea or cysteine solution or water.
this mixture was held at 37°c before addition of dbh (0.0063
units/ 50 lin 0,2 m na acetate buffer, ph 5,0). finally, the substrate,
tyramine (50 ul, 0.4 m), was added and the mixture was incubated
for 30 min at 37 °c, after which 200 wl of 4. mhci1og was added to
stop the reaction. the mixture was placed on a 3 mm column of
dowex (50w-x8, 200-400 mesh) and washed with 4 ml of distilled
h0. the product, octopamine, was eluted with 3 ml 4. m nh4oh.
to quantitate octopamine, 1.5 ml of the eluate was added to 150 ul
of nalos (20 g/l), and after 5 min at room temperature, the excess
periodate was reduced with 150 yl na$20s (10 g/l). the p-hy-
droxybenzaldehyde from octopamine oxidation was measured
spectrophotometrically at 330 nm against water by comparison
with an octopamine standard curve. the curve was linear between
sand 50 nmol/ml.

 

  

  
 

 

 

 

biochemical assays and data analysis

radioimmunoassays of gh, tsh and prl were performed us-
ing materials supplied by the national pituitary agency, balti-
more, md. detection limits of these radioimmunoassays were
0.5-50, 10-500 and 0.5-25 ng/tube for rgh-rp-1, rtsh-rp-1 and
rprl-rp-1, respectively. plasma corticosterone was measured by
radioimmunoassay using a commercially prepared antiserum (ra-
dioassay systems laboratories, carson, calif.). detection limits of
this assay were 10-1,000 ng/ml.

hypothalamic tissue levels of somatostatin and  xxxg2240xxx 
were determined by radioimmunoassays, as described previously
[i5, 43]. values are expressed as ng/mg tissue for somatostatin and
pg/mg tissue for  xxxg2240xxx .

dopamine, ne, epi, dopa and mea were measured using
hplc and electrochemical detection (fig. 1). separation was per-
formed on a 5 tm c-18 biophase ods column (250 x 4.6 mm). a
lc-4a electrochemical detector was used with a glassy carbon
electrode (bioanalytical systems, west lafayette, ind.). the elec-
trode potential was maintained at + 0.65 v versus an ag/agcl ref-
erence electrode. the mobile phase for quantitation of ne, dopa,
epi and mea was a monochloroacetic acid buffer (0.14 m, ph 3.0)
containing 0.7 mm edta (disodium), 0.77 mm decyl sodium sul-
fate, and 6% acetonitrile. to quantitate da and 5-ht, the mobile
phase was a monochloroacetic acid buffer (0.12 m, ph 3.0) con-
taining 0.61 mm edta, 0.65 mm octyl sodium sulfate and 17%
methanol. the flow rate in both determinations was 1.3 ml/min.
the limits of detection, defined as a signal/noise ratio greater than
3, were 25 pg for dopa, da, ne and s-ht, 50 pg for epi and 50
ng for mea. levels were expressed as pm/mg tissue or pm/mg
protein,

total protein (supernatant + pellet) was measured by the
lowry method [19].

the column was a biophase ods c-18 (5 um, 250 x 4.6 cm), the
detector was glassy carbon (+ 0.65 v) and the flow rate was 1.3
ml/min. numbers preceding each compound represent elution
time (min).

single factor analyses of variance, followed by newman-keul’s
tests [51] were used to compare the effects of mea on: (a) plasma
gh, tsh and corticosterone levels in stressed animals; (b) plasma
gh and prl levels in rats with rats with arc/vmn lesions, (c)
tissue levels of catecholamines and mea, and (d) dbh activity in
vitro. p < 0.05 was considered significant.

 

results

the highest dose of mea (300 mg/kg) caused a behav-
ioral response manifested by drowsiness and decreased
locomotor activity approximately 10-15 min after injection,
and lasting 10-20 min. no seizure activity was observed. a
hematoma occurred at the injection site in most animals af-
ter 300 mg/kg. these effects were not observed after lower
doses of mea.

 xxxd1787xxx  effects on the plasma gh, tsh, and

corticosterone responses to swimming stress

a low dose of mea (100 mg/kg) caused a significant
increase in resting mean plasma gh levels, whereas resting
levels after a high dose of mea (300 mg/kg) were low and
not significantly different from the control group (fig. 2).
stress-induced gh suppression was partially blocked by a
low dose of mea; the high dose had no effect. immediately
after the period of stress there was a significant increase in
mean plasma gh in the control and low-dose mea groups.

this effect was blocked by the high dose of mea. cysteine
(300 mg/kg) had no effect on gh, tsh or corticosterone.

resting mean tsh plasma levels were increased above
controls in both mea groups; swimming stress did not sig-
nificantly alter these levels (fig. 3). similar to gh, there was
a significant poststress increase in plasma tsh in the low-
dose mea and control groups; an effect that was also
blocked by a high dose of mea.

 xxxd1787xxx  caused a dose-related increase in resting
mean plasma corticosterone concentrations, and partially
suppressed the response to stress (fig. 4). however, 2 h after
stress, corticosterone was again increased above control
levels in both treatment groups.

 xxxd1787xxx  effects on plasma gh and prl in

arc/vmn-lesioned animals

the brains of animals with sham and arc/vmn le-
sions were examined histologically to determine the
symmetry and extent of their lesions. only those animals
with bilateral arc/vmn lesions were included in this
study. as expected [14, 21, 32], arc/vmn lesions caused a
complete suppression of episodic gh release and a marked
enhancement of prl secretion (fig. 5). the increase in
plasma prl indicates destruction of the inhibitory arcuate
dopaminergic system (a12) [28].  xxxd1787xxx  (150 mg/kg)
decreased plasma prl down to low or unmeasureable lev-
els, and enhanced resting gh levels, but did not restore
pulsatile gh secretion.

n = 8/group).

 xxxd1787xxx  time course effects on

hypothalamic monoamines

two h after mea (300 mg/kg) there was an increase in
da (p < 0.001) and a decrease in ne (p < 0.01) and epi (p
< 0.02) (fig. 6). dopamine remained elevated at 4h (p <
0.004) and ne and epi continued to decline (p < 0.001 and
0.003, respectively). by 24 h, da returned to control levels,
ne was rising, and epi was still decreasing.  xxxd1787xxx 
had no effect on 5-ht or dopa levels (data not shown).

dose-response and time course correlations between

hypothalamic levels of mea and ne

tissue levels of mea, measured 4 h after administra-
tion, increased proportionally with increasing doses (fig.
7a). doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg caused significant reduc-
tions in ne levels (p < 0.004 and 0.007, respectively).
there was a significant inverse correlation (p < 0.01) be-
tween the increase in mea and the decrease in ne levels.

respectively; n 6/group). the decrease in the ratio of
epi/ne (4. vs. 3.1:1, for controls vs. mea; p < 0.001)
was most likely due to the rapid turnover rate and/or re-
lease of epi by the adrenal gland. previous studies have
shown that mea increases plasma epi levels over a 4-hour
time course [4] and causes adrenocortical hemorrhagic ne-
crosis [22].

    

inhibition of dbh activity in vitro by mea and cysteine

both mea and cysteine caused significant inhibition of
dbh activity in a dose-dependent manner (table i). this
effect was blocked by  xxxd2684xxx .  xxxd1787xxx 
caused maximal inhibition of dbh at a concentration of 1
mm. thus, even though both thiols had approximately
equal activity in vitro, cysteine had no effect on neuroendo-
crine function. this may be due to rapid metabolic clear-
ance of cysteine and/or poor central nervous system pene-
tration.

discussion

results of this study indicate that mea disrupts neuro-
endocrine systems involved in the regulation of gh, tsh,
and corticosterone secretion. interpretation of these results
is confounded by the finding that mea lowers hypotha-

lamic somatostatin and blocks ne and epi biosynthesis by
its inhibitory effect on dbh. however, since these two ef-
fects manifested at different doses, it was possible to selec-
tively lower somatostatin levels without significantly affect-
ing ne/epi levels.

previous studies have shown that mea reduces hypo-
thalamic somatostatin in a dose-dependent manner, and
that the effect is demonstrable at doses of 30 mg/kg body
weight and above [35]. the present studies indicate that
mea inhibits ne and epi biosynthesis in a dose- xxxd2870xxx -
dent manner at doses of 150 mg/kg and above. the decline
in hypothalamic ne was inversely proportional to mea
tissue levels and reached a nadir 6 h after mea administra
tion (300 mg/kg); mea reached a zenith at 4 h. thus, ad
ministration of mea in high doses lowers hypothalamic so-
matostatin, ne and epi, whereas, lower doses cause only a
reduction in somatostatin.

both mea and cysteine were equipotent in their ability
to inhibit dbh activity in vitro, confirming earlier findings
[8]. inhibition of dbh by sulfhydryl compounds is due to
their chelation of copper atoms at the active site of the en-
 xxxg1282xxx  [30]. inhibition of dbh by cysteine can be reversed by
the addition of  xxxd2684xxx , which reacts with sulf-
hydryl groups [30]. the present study indicates that mea-
induced dbh inhibition can also be reversed by n-ethyl-
maleimide.

 xxxd1787xxx  effects on swimming stress-induced gh
suppression were dose- dependent. the high dose of mea
(300 mg/kg) suppressed episodic gh secretion during the
entire 6-hour sampling period, and there was no response
to stress. an earlier study using the same doses of mea
showed an absence of gh secretory bursts, increased gh
trough levels, and an attenuation of serum gh suppression
after short-term immobilization stress [25]. in the present
study, only the lower dose of mea (100 mg/kg) increased
resting levels and partially blocked stress-induced gh sup-
pression. these differences may be due to the severity of the
stress. also, there was a significant increase in plasma gh
levels immediately after the stress period followed by in-
creased trough levels. the effects of mea (100 mg/kg) on
gh trough levels and stress-induced gh inhibition were
similar to those observed after immunoneutralization of cir-
culating somatostatin with anti-somatostatin antiserum [2.
13, 47]. however, in an earlier study, gh levels in controls
were inhibited for a longer time without a poststress re-
bound [47]. moreover, a previous study showed that admin-
istration of anti-somatostatin to mea-treated (300 mg/kg)
rats resulted in a further elevation of gh levels [25], sug-
gesting that mea reduces, but does not deplete, the release-
able pool of hypothalamic somatostatin. destruction of
grf neurons in the vmn and arc nuclei [23] suppressed
episodic gh secretion, confirming earlier studies [14, 21].
administration of mea (150 mg/kg) to these animals ele-
vated gh trough levels, bud did not restore episodic secre-

tion. taken together, these results indicate that lower doses
of mea appear to cause a selective reduction in hypotha-
lamic somatostatin, which partially suppresses somatostat-
in-mediated gh inhibition, but does not affect grf-medi-
ated episodic release.

inhibition of episodic gh secretion by high mea doses
is most likely due to the reduction in ne and epi, both of
which enhance gh secretion [9, 20, 44, 45, 50]. this hypo-
thesis is supported by the finding that morphine-induced
gh release, which is also mediated by epi and possibly ne
[1], 17, 44], is diminished after high doses of mea [25].
nonspecific stress effects may also contribute to this effect
[25]. since mea had no effect on hypothalamic 5-ht lev-
els, it is doubtful that 5-ht-facilitated gh secretion [20, 50]
is disrupted. it remains to be determined whether high
doses of mea have a direct effect on hypothalamic grf.
however, this is not likely because clonidine-stimulated
gh release, which is believed to be mediated by enhanced
grf release [9, 11, 44, 45], is not affected by mea.

resting levels of plasma tsh were increased | h after
mea (100 and 300 mg/kg) administration. a previous
study, using a different strain of rats, showed that mea (90.
and 300 mg/kg) caused a rapid decline in plasma tsh and
attributed this effect to a reduction in central ne, even
though the lower dose did not decrease hypothalamic ne
[24]. the reason for these conflicting results is not clear.
 xxxd1787xxx  increases plasma epi [4] and corticosterone
levels and induces hypothermia [4], all of which are known
to affect tsh secretion [7, 10, 12, 29]. in the present study, it
appears that the initial effect of mea was predominantly
suppression of somatostatin-mediated tsh inhibition for
two reasons. first, doses of mea = 150 mg/kg are re-
quired to cause significant inhibition of dbh, whereas,
doses = 30 mg/kg reduce somatostatin levels [35]. second,
lower doses of mea (90-100 mg/kg) do not cause signifi-
cant inhibition of episodic gh release [25, 42], which is also
dependent on ne and epi [9, 11, 44, 45]. although plasma
tsh levels were unaffected during swimming stress, levels
rose immediately thereafter in the control and low-dose
mea-treated groups. this response was completely
blocked by the high dose of mea, and was similar to that of
gh. these results indicate that the poststress rebound in
plasma tsh and gh is mediated by ne and/or epi. fur-
thermore, the mea-induced increase in da may also have
inhibited the rise in tsh after stress. previous studies have
shown that da inhibits tsh release in vivo and in vitro [7,
18, 29}.

 xxxd1787xxx  caused a dose-dependent increase in resting
plasma corticosterone levels and partially suppressed the
tesponse to swimming stress. although this response is con-
sistent with known effects of stress on corticosterone [50],
mea has more specific actions that could account for these
findings. first, previous investigations showed that inhibit-
ion of epi synthesis with nmt blockers increased plasma

 

 

 

corticosterone levels [48: terry, unpublished], suggesting
that epi inhibits adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth)
secretion. second, mea-induced adrenocortical necrosis
[22] could result in uncontrolled corticosterone release from
dying cells, which would also inhibit acth release, and
suppress the response to stress, finally, decreased somato-
statin may also contribute to this process, since mea-in-
duced adrenocortical necrosis is suppressed by somatostat-
in [22].

prolactin secretion was significantly enhanced by le-
sions of the arc/vmn nuclei, confirming disruption of
the al2 tuberoinfindibular dopaminergic system [28]. cys-
teamine caused an immediate and prolonged inhibition of
prl in these animals. these results support previous find-
ings showing that the inhibitory effect of mea on prl is
not due to enhanced da neurotransmission [26, 27].

finally, using hplc with electrochemical detection, we
were able to measure levels of mea as low as 625 pm. two
previously described methods can detect approximately
10-20 um of mea [16, 33]. the method described herein
has advantages over the others because it is approximately
10-15 x more sensitive, it only requires extraction with
hclog, and, if desired, catecholamines can be measured
simultaneously. although we did not search for other sulf-
hydryl compounds, it is possible that intracellular conver-
sion of mea occurred, and that, perhaps, the active com-
pound is a metabolite of mea.
