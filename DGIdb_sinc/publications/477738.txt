spontaneously hypertensive rats. european j. pharmacol. 57 (1979) 21--27.
the  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao) inhibitor  xxxd2850xxx  induced a moderate (about 20 mm hg) but persistent
(48 h) decrease of systolic blood pressure in unanesthetized adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (shr) but not
in normotensive rats. the fall of blood pressure correlated with the blockade of norepinephrine (ne) deamination
by brain homogenates. after an intracerebroventricular (icy) injection of 6-hydroxydoparnine, which lowered
brain ne content by about 70%,  xxxd2850xxx  was unable to diminish arterial pressure. blockade of central ~-adrenoceptors by treatment with  xxxd2914xxx  (100 pg icy) could either prevent or reverse the fall of blood pressure in
shr induced by  xxxd2850xxx . moreover, a low dose of  xxxd2850xxx  injected directly into the brain lowered arterial
pressure. we conclude that the hypotensive action of  xxxd2850xxx  in shr appears to be the consequence of ne
accumulating at an inhibitory ~-adrenoceptor in brain.

1. introduction
 xxxd2850xxx , a  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  (mao)
inhibitor, is used clinically to treat moderate
hypertension. this use of the drug is paradoxical as it delays the metabolism of endogenous pressor amines such as the catecholamines. the mechanisms proposed to explain
the antihypertensive action of the drug
usually implicate the sympathetic nervous
system (gessa et al., 1963; neff and costa,
1966; puig et al., 1972; kopin et al., 1965).

6-hydroxydopamine

for example,  xxxd2850xxx  may be antihypertensive because it suppresses transmission
through sympathetic ganglia, reduces the
synthesis and release of norepinephrine (ne)
from nerve endings or induces the accumulation of "false transmitters" in nerve endings
and when these transmitters are released by
nerve impulses they are less vasoactive than
ne. these explanations have not been acceptable to all pharmacologists.
the nucleus of the solitary tract, a primary
termination site of most of the carotid sinus
fibres, as well as other nuclei in the brainstem and the hypothalamus, plays a role
in the control of blood pressure. these brain
regions are rich in ne terminals (fuxe, 1965).
yamori et al. (1972) provided evidence that
an elevated brain ne content was correlated
with a fall of blood pressure in spontaneously

22
hypertensive rats (shr). de jong (1974)
found that stimulation by ne of inhibitory
central a-adrenoceptors located in the brainstem diminished the sympathetic tone withas
results a decrease in peripheral vascular
resistance. moreover, it is postulated that
a-methyl-dopa, through a-methyl-ne (henning, 1969), and clonidine (dollery and
reid, 1973), diminishes high arterial pressure
by stimulating central inhibitory a-adrenoceptors.
we present evidence suggesting that  xxxd2850xxx  reduced blood pressure in shr by
causing ne to accumulate at an inhibitory
a-adrenoceptor in the brain. the blood pressure decrease was positively correlated with
the inhibition of mao. the antihypertensive
action of  xxxd2850xxx  was prevented by prior
treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (64:)hda)
or the a-adrenoceptor blocking drug  xxxd2914xxx .

2. materials and methods
shr and normotensive wistar-kyoto rats
(wkr) (okamoto and aoki, 1963), were
supplied by the national institutes of health
(bethesda, md., u.s.a.). male sprague-dawley rats, 200--250 g, obtained from zivicmiller laboratories (allison park, pa. u.s.a.),
were included in some of the studies for comparison with shr and wkr. male shr and
wkr, 25 weeks of age, were selected for
this study.
the systolic blood pressure of unanesthetized animals was recorded with a w & w
blood pressure recorder (gerold and tschirky,
1968); a mean value from at least 6 consecutive readings for each animal was used for
computations.
mao activity was assayed in brain homogenates with ne (1-noradrenaline-methylene94c, amersham, bucks., u.k.), 12 pm,
as substrate as described previously (fuentes
and neff, 1977}. in brief, brain was homogenized with 5 vol. of 67 mm phosphate
buffer, ph 7.2, and centrifuged at 750 × g

j.a. fuentes et al.
for 10min. the supernatant, 0.1 ml, was
incubated together with the substrate at
37°c for 60 min in a total volume of 0.25 ml.
 xxxd228xxx  (2.3 mm) was included in the
buffer and the reaction was carried out in
the absence of light. reaction products were
separated by cation exchange chromatography.
stainless steel permanent cannulas, 23
gauge, were implanted into a lateral ventricle
for the intracerebroventricular (icy) injection
of  xxxd2850xxx  or  xxxd2914xxx . all injections
were given at least 6 days after surgery to
unanesthetized animals, the injection volume
being 10 pl.
6-ohda (dissolved in 1%  xxxd228xxx )
was administered icy as described by noble
et al. (1967). two doses of 64:)hda (1.63
pg in 10 pl) were given 48 h apart and the
experiments performed 11 days later, once
the blood pressure (haeusler et al., 1972) as
well as the gross behavior of the rats had
returned to normal. the ne content of t h e
brain-stem was measured fluorimetrically by
the method of shore and olin (1958) to
evaluate the extent of the 6-ohda lesion.
student's t-test was used for statistical
analysis of the data.
drugs were obtained from the following
sources:  xxxd2850xxx  hydrochloride, donated
by abott laboratories (north chicago, ii.,
u.s.a.);  xxxd2914xxx  hydrochloride ( xxxd2914xxx , ciba-geigy, switzerland); 6-hydroxydopamine hydrobromide (sigma). all drug
doses refer to the salts.

3. results

3.1. antihypertensive effect of  xxxd2850xxx 
the basal blood pressure was somewhat
higher in wkr (p < 0.05) than in spraguedawley rats (table 1 ). the arterial pressure of
shr was about 70 mm hg higher than that
of the wkr.
 xxxd2850xxx , 10 mg/kg iv, reduced systolic
pressure in shr for more than 48 h. the

a dose--response study with  xxxd2850xxx

produced a transient fall of blood pressure
while 1 mg/kg was ineffective when compared with a dose of 10 mg/kg (fig. 1).

a 10 mg/kg dose was administered iv to
shr. at various times (1--120 h) thereafter
their blood pressure was measured after which
they were killed and brain mao activity
analysed. there was a positive correlation
between the fall of blood pressure and brain
mao activity measured in vitro using ne as
substrate (fig. 2). moreover it appeared that
a blockade of more than a b o u t 65% of the
mao activity in brain was necessary before
the blood pressure was observed to decline.

blood pressure fell slightly in wkr at 2 h,
but not in sprague-dawley rats at the time
intervals evaluated. this dose of  xxxd2850xxx 
did n o t alter the gross behavior of the rats.

3.4. blockade or reversal by  xxxd2914xxx  o f
the hypotensive response to  xxxd2850xxx 
a dose o f  xxxd2914xxx  (100 #g icy),
known to be ineffective when injected
systemically (finch and haeusler, 1973) was
administered alone or in combination with
 xxxd2850xxx  (fig. 4).  xxxd2914xxx  alone induced
a short-lasting fall of blood pressure; however,
it reduced or reversed the  xxxd2850xxx -induced
fall in blood pressure.

3.5. antihypertensive action o f icv administered  xxxd2850xxx 
the quantity of  xxxd2850xxx  (200 pg) which
might be expected in brain if a dose of
1 mg/kg iv were administered (this dose did
not alter blood pressure, fig. 1), was injected
icy into shr (table 2). a control group
received saline. following this treatment
there was a fall of blood pressure lasting more
than 2 h.

4. discussion

in our studies  xxxd2850xxx  was indeed an antihypertensive agent as its action could be seen

25

readily in shr but not in normotensive wkr
or sprague-dawley rats. it is a long lasting
mao inhibitor as it binds covalently to
mao; the return of enzyme activity is thus
the result of enzyme synthesis (oreland et al.,
1973). the antihypertensive effect of  xxxd2850xxx  in shr was long lasting and was correlated with the blockade of brain mao when
tested with ne as substrate. the finding that
the effect of a single dose of  xxxd2850xxx  lasted
for more than 48 h and that there was a correlation between the fall of blood pressure and
the inhibition of brain mao suggests that the
accumulation o f an amine in brain was
responsible for the fall in pressure. yamori et
al. (1972) using a combination of l-dopa
and a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor,
found a negative correlation between brainstem ne content and systolic pressure in
shr. in fact, injecting ne into the nucleus
of the solitary tract decreases blood pressure
in the rat (de jong, 1974).
two types of mao activity are found in rat
brain, a type a and a t y p e b enzyme activity
(johnston, 1968). type a enzyme activity is
resistant to inhibition by  xxxd2850xxx  while
type b enzyme activity is not. for example,
a dose of 1 mg/kg iv blocked t y p e b enzyme
by more than 90% and type a by about 40%
(fuentes and neff, 1975). the apparent
endogenous substrate for type b enzyme is
phenylethylamine (yang and neff, 1973) and
one of the endogenous substrates for type a
enzyme is ne (fuentes and neff, 1975). we
found that it required more than 1 mg/kg iv
 xxxd2850xxx  to lower the blood pressure in shr
implying that blockade of t y p e a mao and
consequently the blockade of the metabolism
of ne or of another substrate for type a
enzyme was necessary for antihypertensive
activity. in this regard, the activity o f t y p e a
and not type b mao o f the cardiovascular
system decreases with age suggesting that
hypertension associated with age might be
related to an increase of the concentration of
circulating ne (fuentes et al., 1977).
the central injection of 6 ~ ) h d a destroys
catecholamine-containing neurons and the

26

ability of the shr to respond to treatment
with  xxxd2850xxx . moreover, the antihypertensive effects of a-methyl-dopa (finch et al.
1975) and clonidine (dollery and reid, 1973)
are also blocked by prior treatment with
6~:)hda.
a-adrenoceptors are present in brain and
their stimulation by ne lowers blood pressure
(van zwieten, 1975). a-methyl-ne (trinkler,
1971) and clonidine (dollery and reid, 1973),
are postulated to lower blood pressure by
stimulation of an inhibitory a-adrenoceptor
as their hypotensive action is blocked by
 xxxd2914xxx . the antihypertensive activity
of  xxxd2850xxx  is also prevented or reversed by
treatment with  xxxd2914xxx . furthermore,
the site of action of  xxxd2850xxx  appears to be in
the brain as a relatively low dose of  xxxd2850xxx 
can lower arterial pressure in shr after an
injection into the brain.
epinephrine is a substrate for mao and its
injection into the brain decreases blood pressure (borkowski and finch, 1978). epinephrine-containing neurons are less susceptible to
destruction by 64:)hda than are ne-containing neurons (fuxe et al., 1975). however,
the hypotension brought about by the icv
administration of epinephrine to shr is
prevented by central ~-adrenoceptor blockade,
and not by a-adrenoceptor blockade (borkowski and finch, 1978).
in summary,  xxxd2850xxx  appears to lower
blood pressure in shr by allowing ne to
accumulate and interact with an inhibitory
a-adrenoceptor in brain. drugs such as a-methyl-dopa and clonidine may also modulate
blood pressure by acting at the same a-adrenoceptor.
