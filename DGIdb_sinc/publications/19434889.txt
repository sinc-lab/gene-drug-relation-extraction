abstract
besides the natural progestin, progesterone, there are different classes of progestins, such as retroprogesterone (i.e.  xxxd1957xxx ), progesterone derivatives (i.e. medrogestone) 17␣- xxxd2303xxx  derivatives (i.e. chlormadinone acetate,  xxxd1786xxx ,  xxxd2554xxx ,  xxxd2557xxx ), 19-norprogesterone derivatives (i.e. nomegestrol, promegestone, trimegestone, nesterone), 19-nortestosterone derivatives  xxxd2751xxx  (net), lynestrenol, levonorgestrel,  xxxd1849xxx ,
gestodene,  xxxd2753xxx , dienogest) and spironolactone derivatives (i.e.  xxxd1946xxx ).
some of the synthetic progestins are prodrugs, which need to be metabolized to become active compounds. besides the
progestogenic effect, which is in common for all progestins, there is a wide range of biological effects, which are different for
the various progestins and have to be taken into account, when medical treatment is considered.

1. introduction
recent prospective randomised studies on hormone
replacement therapy (hrt), among others the hers
i and ii as well as the whi and mws [1–5], have
raised great concern regarding the role of progestins
for the cardiovascular and venous system and breast
cancer in the climacteric and postmenopausal woman.

neither secondary nor primary prevention of cardiovascular events seems to be accomplished and the rate
of invasive breast cancer seems even to be raised. this
could be related to the specific progestin used in hrt
in these studies. since there is a large body of data, partially conflicting, on the various progestins it appears
mandatory to scrutinize the progestins in clinical use.
basically all progestins do have only one effect in common, the progestogenic effect on the
estrogen-primed endometrium of the rabbit, but there
are large differences between progestins in the multitude of other biological effects elicited. in practice,

according to reference [5–8].

clinically used synthetic progestins have been selected
on other effects, e.g. activity after oral administration
and favourable bio-availability or inhibition of ovulation, but not on pregnancy maintaining capacity, a
very important biological role for progesterone.
besides  xxxd3023xxx , produced and secreted normally in the human female by the corpus
luteum, the placenta and in small quantities by the
adrenal cortex, there is a broad spectrum of steroids
with progesterone-like actions, derived from different
parent compounds. an overview is given in table 1
and the formulations are shown in figs. 1 and 2. close
to the  xxxd3023xxx  we have retroprogesterone,
followed by the pregnane-(17- xxxd2303xxx ,
c-21) derivatives and the 19-norprogesterone-(19norpregnane, c-20) derivatives. a clinically important group and the basis for the success of hormonal
contraception are the 19-nortestosterone derivatives,
subdivided in estranes (c-18) and gonanes (c-17).
recently, a  xxxd3238xxx  derivative has been developed
for clinical use. some of these compounds are prodrugs, they are metabolised to the active compounds
by the liver, examples are promegestone converted to
trimegestone,  xxxd1849xxx  to 3-keto- xxxd1849xxx  and
 xxxd2753xxx  to  xxxd2754xxx  [6–9].

2. pharmacodynamics of progestins
with regard to the progestogenic activity, the timecourse of the serum concentrations of the steroids after
the application (pharmacokinetics) which is dependent

upon absorption, metabolism in the gastro-intestinal
tract and liver (first-pass effect), distribution and storage in fat and other tissues, binding to serum proteins,
inactivation and conjugation, is of particular importance.
depending on the route of administration, oral or
parenteral (vaginal, intramuscular, transdermal), progestins can manifest different effects that are due to
differences in metabolism. for progesterone this has
been demonstrated experimentally [10]. orally administered progesterone, even in micronised form, shows
a wide variation of absorption and bioavailability in
the individual person. after oral administration, synthetic progestins are in general rapidly absorbed and
reach a maximum serum concentration within 2–5 h,
they have a longer half-life than progesterone and display stable plasma levels on long-term use. many of
them are metabolised in the liver and are excreted via
the urine [6,8,9,11].
2.1.  xxxd1957xxx 
 xxxd1957xxx  is a retroprogesterone, a stereoisomer of progesterone, with an additional double
bond between carbon 6 and 7. the progesterone
molecule is almost “flat”, the retroprogesterone
molecule is bent by a change of the methyl group at
carbon 10 from the ␤-position to the ␣-position and
the hydrogen at c9 from the ␣ to the ␤ position. in
addition, there is an additional double bond between
c6 and c7 (see fig. 3).  xxxd1957xxx  appears
to be a highly selective progestin which, due to its

173

retrostructure, binds almost exclusively to the  xxxg1737xxx . though the binding affinity appears
to be somewhat lower than that of progesterone, due
to its better bioaviability and the progestogenic na-

ture of the metabolites, the equivalence dose is 10–20
times lower, regarding endometrial proliferation.  xxxd1957xxx  is metabolised by reduction at c20 to
the 20␣-hydroxy-derivative and by hydroxylation

at the c21-methyl group and at the c16␣-position.
these three metabolites represent 70% of the urinary
excretion after taking  xxxd1957xxx . metabolites
maintain the retrosteroid structure and have a simi-

lar profile as  xxxd1957xxx . due to its selectivity,
effects not mediated by the  xxxg1737xxx 
are minimal or absent [6,8,9,11,12]. the effects of
 xxxd1957xxx  are listed in table 2.

c17␣- and the c6-positions and in addition, a double bond between c6 and c7 (see fig. 1). after oral
administration, absorption is rapid and the bioavailability is close to 100%; the peak plasma level is obtained at 1 h. the major proportion of medrogestone
is bound to albumin. inactivation of the molecule is
accomplished by hydroxylation [6,8,11,14]. the biological effects tested are summarized in table 2.

2.2. medrogestone
medrogestone is not a derivative of 17␣- xxxd2303xxx  because it has a methyl group at the

2.3.1. 17alpha- xxxd2303xxx  and
17alpha- xxxd2303xxx  esters (see fig. 1)
for the progestogenic activity the c17 position is of
key importance. progesterone looses its progestogenic
activity with the introduction of the hydroxyl group
of the position c17. while 17␣- xxxd2303xxx 
is hormonally inactive, its esterification on the one
hand with acetate leads to weak progestogenic activity,
while on the other hand esterification with caproate
leads to a highly active progestin, which is clinically

useful for intramuscular injection, and is found in the
circulation as unmetabolised ester [6,8,9,11].
2.3.2.  xxxd2554xxx  (mpa)
(see fig. 1)
after oral intake  xxxd2554xxx  does
not undergo any first pass effect. the bioavailability is
nearly 100%. mpa has no binding affinity to shgb
and cbg and in serum mpa is bound to albumin for
88%. the most important metabolic steps are hydroxylation reactions. the various biological effects are
summarized in table 2 [6,8,9,14,15].
2.3.3.  xxxd2557xxx  (ma) (see fig. 1)
similar to mpa the bioavailability of ma is nearly
100%. ma is not bound to shbg or cbg and the majority of circulating ma is bound to  xxxg124xxx .
the most important metabolic pathways are hydroxylation reactions. the various biological effects of the
compound are summarized in table 2 [6,8,9,14,15].
2.3.4. chlormadinone acetate (cma) (see fig. 1)
the chlorine atom at c6 characterizes the molecule.
after oral administration cma is rapidly absorbed
and undergoes nearly no first pass metabolism. therefore the bioavailability is nearly 100%. cma accumulates in fat tissue. the elimination occurs slowly.
after 7 days only 34% of the dose has been excreted.
inactivation occurs mainly through the reduction
of the 3-keto-group whereby the double bound in
ring a is preserved. the most important metabolite
is the 3-hydroxy-cma, which shows 70% of the
anti-androgenic activity of cma. hydroxylation occurs at positions c2␣, c3␤ and c15␤. the majority
of the metabolites are excreted renally, predominantly
as glucoronides. the conjugates which are excreted
with the bile, can be hydrolysed in the colon and reabsorbed. this enterohepatic circulation might be of
clinical relevance with respect to the anti-androgenic
properties of 3-hydroxy-cma [6,8,9,14,15]. the various biological effects are summarized in table 2.
2.3.5.  xxxd1786xxx  (cpa) (see fig. 1)
the bioavailability is nearly 100%. since there
is no binding of cpa to shbg and cbg in the
serum, 93% of the compound is bound to  xxxg124xxx . it is stored in fat tissue and is excreted slowly.
therefore, daily intake of higher doses of cpa cause

an accumulation resulting in a depot effect. most
important metabolic steps are hydroxylation reactions and de-acetylation. also metabolites, such as
15␤-hydroxy-cpa show anti-androgenic activity, similar to that of cpa, but the metabolite has only 10%
of the progestogenic potency of cpa [6,8,9,14,15].
the biological effects of the compound are shown in
table 2.
2.4. 17alpha-hydroxy 19-norprogesterone derivatives
2.4.1. nomegestrol acetate (see fig. 1)
absorption is rapid after oral intake. the maximum
concentration is reached after 2 h. metabolism is essentially by glucoronide- and sulphate-conjugation
with a considerable enterohepatic recirculation
[8,9,11,12]. the biological effects are shown in
table 2.
2.5. 19-norprogesterone derivatives
2.5.1. promegestone (r5020) (see fig. 1)
promegestone is rapidly absorbed after oral intake
and has a short half-life. the maximal concentration
is reached 1–2 h after administration. promegestone is
bound only to a small extent to shbg, the binding to
cbg is weak and thus it is mainly bound to  xxxg124xxx . it is metabolised by hydroxylation [8,9,11,12].
the possible biological effects are shown in table 2.
2.5.2. trimegestone (see fig. 1)
this is the most recent 19-norprogesterone derivative for clinical use. trimegestone is an active metabolite of promegestone. it has a strong progestogenic
effect. further biological actions of the compound are
summarised in table 2 [8,9,11,12].
2.5.3. nesterone
nesterone, a 16-methylen-17␣-acetoxyd-19-norpregnene-3,20-dione is only active, when administered
parenterally because of its rapid hepatic metabolism.
nesterone has a low oral activity but is very potent
parenterally. besides the high binding affinity to the
 xxxg1737xxx , the binding to the androgen
receptor is negligible. there is no binding to the
 xxxg730xxx . it does not show glucocorticoid
activity and there is no binding to shbg. there is a
rapid clearance [9,17,18].

a.e. schindler et al. / maturitas 61 (1–2) (2003) 171–180

2.6. 19-nortestosterone derivatives
2.6.1.  xxxd2751xxx  (net) (see fig. 1)
 xxxd2751xxx  is also named  xxxd2751xxx  and is
often used as  xxxd2751xxx  acetate (neta). both
compounds are rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. the bioavailability is about 64%, 36%
are bound to shbg, 61% to  xxxg124xxx  and 3%
are free in the circulation. the principal metabolite
is 5-␣-dihydro- xxxd2751xxx  [8,9,16]. the biological
activities of the compound are shown in table 2.
2.6.2. lynestrenol (see fig. 2)
lynestrenol is a prodrug and is converted in
vivo to  xxxd2751xxx . the conversion is rapid
and almost total. the compound is metabolised by
3␤-hydroxylation and dehydrogenation [8,9,12,16]
the biological effects are listed in table 2.
2.6.3. dl- xxxd2754xxx 
dl- xxxd2754xxx  is a racemic dl-mixture. only the
levorotatory form is biologically active [8,9,16].
2.6.4. levonorgestrel (see fig. 2)
it is rapidly absorbed when taken orally. the
bioavailability is practically 100% and the peakplasma-level is obtained between 1 and 3 h after administration. levonorgestrel is bound to shgb in
47.5%, 50% to  xxxg124xxx  and 2.5% are unbound.
levonorgestrel causes a decrease of shbg of 50%
[8,9,16]. the biological effects are shown in table 2.
2.6.5.  xxxd1849xxx  (see fig. 2)
 xxxd1849xxx  is a prodrug, its activity is essentially
based on transformation to 3-keto- xxxd1849xxx , the
principal metabolite formed in vivo. though the
bioavailability is 76%, the peak plasma concentration
after absorption is reached in 1.15 h. 32% are bound
to shbg, 66% to albumin and 2% remains free
[8,9,16]. the biological effects are shown in table 2.
2.6.6. gestodene (see fig. 2)
gestodene is not a prodrug and is absorbed without
modification so that its bioavaiability is almost 100%
[8,9,16]. the biological effects are shown in table 2.

177

2.6.7.  xxxd2753xxx  (see fig. 2)
 xxxd2753xxx  is also a prodrug, which is rapidly
absorbed and metabolised and converted to  xxxd2754xxx .
unchanged  xxxd2753xxx  is not found in the urine. the
absorption is rapid and the peak will be reached 1 h
after intake [8,9,16]. the biological effects are listed
in table 2.
2.6.8. dienogest (see fig. 2)
this so called hybrid progestin has a unique pharmacological and pharmacodynamic profile combining
the typical properties of the 19-nortestosterones with
those of progesterone derivatives [10]. dienogest is a
19-nortestosterone compound, which is not alkylated
at c17. there is a cyanomethyl group at position 17␣
as well as a double bond between c9 and c10 in
ring b of the molecule. the compound is rapidly absorbed after oral intake. the peak level is reached after
2 h. the bioavailability is about 90%. ten percent of
dienogest are free in the circulation and 90% bound
to albumin. there is no binding to shbg and cbg.
dienogest is metabolised by hydroxylation and aromatisation [8,9,16]. the biological effects are listed in
table 2.
2.7.  xxxd3238xxx  derivatives
2.7.1.  xxxd1946xxx  (see fig. 2)
 xxxd1946xxx  is rapidly absorbed after oral intake
and the peak plasma level is reached in 1–2 h. the
bioavailability is 76%, 95–97% of  xxxd1946xxx  are
bound to serum albumen.  xxxd1946xxx  does not bind
to shbg or cbg [15]. the biological activities are
listed in table 2.

3. biological activities of the progestins
because of the enormous variation in the chemical structures of steroids with progestational activity, it is very difficult to deduct various biological
actions and activities from the chemical structure
alone [10]. one of the essential requirements of any
compound with such an activity is of course: being able to bind to the progesterone-receptor and
thus some knowledge has been developed about the
three dimensional structure required for a steroid to
bind.

adding to the confusion is the fact that there appears to be several different forms of the progesterone
receptors, usually called pr-a and pr-b, the difference being a sequence of amino-acids in the b-form
that is not found in pr-a. also biologically both forms
have different specifications, interpreted by authors as:
the pr-b is the “normal” receptor, the intermediate
in the agonistic activity in several organs whereas the
pr-b is capable of antagonising the effects stimulated
by an activated pr-a [20]. relatively little is known
yet on the compostion of pr in different tissues during specific periods of development. binding of the
steroids to both forms is expected not to show differences as the steroid binding domain of both isoforms is
identical.
all progestins have in common the so-called progestogenic effect i.e. the induction of a characteristic
change in the estrogen-primed endometrium. the final
progestogenic or progestational activity of any substance depends also on the route and timing of the administration. it varies widely and is often expressed by
the difference in the dose required for the endometrial
transformation in a woman, called the transformation
dose (table 3).

the transformation dose after oral application
is also clinically dependent on whether the compound is used sequentially or in a continuous fashion
(table 4).
on the other hand progestins have been selected
for clinical use on differences of the dose necessary
for inhibition of ovulation. as shown in table 3

progestogenic activity of the various progestins have
been tested by standard bioassays using changes in the
endometrium of estrogen-primed rabbits and also by
the inhibition of ovulation in rats. this is summarised
in table 5 [18].
biological effects at the cellular level are mediated
by intracellular steroid receptors. the ability of any
progestin to bind to the  xxxg1737xxx  varies
between different compounds and by this, the biological effect of the progestin is influenced. this is also
true in relation to binding to other intracellular steroid
receptors. an overview of binding to various receptors
is shown for the progestins and their metabolites in
tables 6 and 7. very little knowledge is available on
binding to the newest class of progesterone receptors,
receptors located on the membrane of many different
cells. for instance, it can be expected that some of
the effects of progestins on the central nervous system
are mediated by these membrane-receptors. there are
also differences in binding to steroid binding proteins
in the circulation (table 6).
recent in vitro studies with cos7 cells on the

odrel and  xxxd1849xxx . in contrast, er␤ was markedly
activated only by  xxxd2754xxx  and to a lesser extent
by  xxxd2751xxx , norethinodrel and levonorgestrel.
gestodene failed to modify  xxxg730xxx  activity. since 19-nortestosterone derivatives, such as
gestodene and  xxxd1849xxx  do not have any affinity
for the  xxxg730xxx , it is supposed that the estrogen activity of  xxxd2751xxx ,  xxxd2754xxx  and levonorgestrel is at least in part a consequence of their
metabolism into the 3(␣,␤) 5␣-reduced derivatives by
5␤-reductase activity in breast cancer cells [19].

4. conclusions
based on the available evidence from in vitro and
in vivo experiments in animals amd humans, it is to be
expected that the full spectrum of biological activities
of different progestins must show considerable variations. however, relatively few studies have been conducted in women in which on a large scale systematic
comparisons have been made between different progestins. in addition, very few of the progestins have
been evaluated by long-term prospective, randomized
double-blind trials. evidence based on in vitro studies
using cell lines is considered to be of value but extrapolation to the in vivo situation is very questionable
and hardly can be used in arguments on effects in the
human.
the available evidence for differences between progestins and related to specific fields of interest is reviewed in the following contributions.
