recent work shows that  xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ) helps maintain normal liver function as chronic hepatic deficiency results in
spontaneous development of steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. the mechanisms by which these nontraditional functions of
 xxxd3156xxx  occur are unknown. here, we use knockout mice deficient in
hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  synthesis (mat1aⴚ/ⴚ) to study the proteome of the
liver during the development of steatohepatitis. one hundred and
seventeen protein spots, differentially expressed during the development of steatohepatitis, were selected and identified by peptide
mass fingerprinting. among them, 12 proteins were found to be
affected from birth, when mat1aⴚ/ⴚ expression is switched on in wt
mouse liver, to the rise of histological lesions, which occurs at ⬇8
months. of the 12 proteins, 4 [prohibitin 1 (phb1),  xxxg569xxx 
oxidase i and ii, and atpase ␤-subunit] have known roles in mitochondrial function. we show that the alteration in expression of phb1
correlates with a loss of mitochondrial function. experiments in
isolated rat hepatocytes indicate that  xxxd3156xxx  regulates phb1 content, thus suggesting ways by which steatohepatitis may be induced.
importantly, we found the expression of these mitochondrial proteins
was abnormal in ob兾ob mice and obese patients who are at risk for
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

s

- xxxd3156xxx  ( xxxd3156xxx ) is an essential metabolite in all
cells.  xxxd3156xxx  serves as the methyl donor for many biological
methylation reactions, provides the propylamino group for the
synthesis of polyamines, and, in the liver, is an intermediary
metabolite in the synthesis of glutathione (1–4). methionine adenosyltransferase (mat) catalyzes the only known  xxxd3156xxx  biosynthetic reaction from methionine and atp (5, 6). in mammals,
there are three mat isoforms (mat i, mat ii, and mat iii)
encoded by two distinct genes ( xxxg1378xxx  and  xxxg1379xxx ; refs. 7–11).
mat i and mat iii are a tetramer and a dimer, respectively, of
a catalytic ␣1-subunit encoded by the gene  xxxg1378xxx  (4, 6). a second
gene,  xxxg1379xxx , encodes for a catalytic ␣2-subunit that forms mat
ii (4, 6). the three enzymes catalyze the same reaction, but their
cellular distribution, kinetics, and regulation are different. although mat ii is the only isoform expressed in extrahepatic tissues
(refs. 12 and 13; with the exception of the pancreas, which expresses
both  xxxg1378xxx  and  xxxg1379xxx ; ref. 14), both mat iii and i, and to a
lesser extent mat ii, are expressed in the liver (13). mat ii
expression also predominates in fetal liver and is progressively
replaced by mat iii and i during liver development (13). in adult
liver, increased expression of  xxxg1379xxx  is associated with rapid
growth or de-differentiation of the liver, as during liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy (15, 16) and in hepatocarcinogenesis (17–19).
 xxxg1378xxx  silencing in extrahepatic tissues and during liver
neoplastic transformation correlates with methylation of the
gene promoter and its association with nonacetylated histones
(20). seemingly, these epigenetic modifications may lead to a
www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0536625100

condensed, transcriptionally inactive chromatin, as suggested by
the observation that  xxxg1378xxx  expression was up-regulated in
hepg2 hepatoma cells in the presence of inhibitors of dna
methylation and histone deacetylation (20). it has been found
subsequently that liver samples from cirrhotic patients, who are
known to have an impaired methionine metabolism and are at
higher risk to develop hepatocellular carcinoma (hcc), show
increased methylation of  xxxg1378xxx  promoter, reduced abundance
of  xxxg1378xxx  mrna, and decreased mat activity (21).
the finding that  xxxg1378xxx  is expressed predominantly in adult
liver and that mat iii and i are replaced by mat ii during liver
neoplastic transformation suggests that these mat isoforms have
distinct rather than overlapping biological roles. this question has
been addressed by the generation of  xxxg1378xxx  knockout (ko;
 xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺) mice (22). homozygous ko mice were born at normal
mendelian ratios, were fertile, and did not show gross anatomical
or behavioral abnormalities (22). in adult ko mice, liver  xxxg1379xxx 
expression was up-regulated to compensate for the absence of
mat iii and i (22). however, ko mice have hypermethioninemia
and reduced hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  content, ⬇20% of that in wt animals
(22). these results indicate that up-regulation of  xxxg1379xxx  expression in adult  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mouse liver cannot compensate for the
absence of mat iii and i in maintaining normal  xxxd3156xxx  levels.
this finding is consistent with known differences in kinetics and
regulation between mat isoforms. whereas mat ii has a low km
for methionine and is inhibited by physiological concentrations of
 xxxd3156xxx  (12, 23), mat iii and i have, respectively, a high and
intermediate km for methionine, are activated by methionine and
atp, and are not inhibited by physiological concentrations of
 xxxd3156xxx  (6–8, 11, 24, 25).
cellular content of  xxxd3156xxx  seems to be related to the
differentiation status of the hepatocyte (26). in this regard,
quiescent and proliferating hepatocytes display different
 xxxd3156xxx  levels, being lower in growing (26). this correlation has
been observed in rat liver after partial hepatectomy (which
triggers the proliferation of the remaining parenchymal cells to
divide quickly and restore the original liver mass), where
 xxxd3156xxx  levels are dramatically reduced shortly after the intervention coinciding with the onset of dna synthesis and the
induction of the early-response genes (15, 16, 27). when this
decrease in  xxxd3156xxx  after partial hepatectomy was prevented by
the administration of  xxxd3156xxx , hepatocyte dna synthesis was
inhibited (19). recent work shows that  xxxd3156xxx  helps turns off

the hepatocyte responses to growth factors, and that without this
protection, the uncontrolled growth of cancer takes place (16).
thus, it has been shown that ko mice deficient in  xxxd3156xxx 
synthesis ( xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺) spontaneously develop oxidative stress,
nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (nash), and hepatocellular carcinoma (22, 28), and in hepatoma cell lines,  xxxd3156xxx  inhibits
growth and induces apoptosis (18). the medical implication of
these observations has emerged by the finding that patients with
liver cirrhosis have impaired synthesis of  xxxd3156xxx  (29, 30). the
precise mechanisms by which these nontraditional functions of
 xxxd3156xxx  take place are unknown. here, we use  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
to carry out an extensive proteomic analysis of the liver during
the development of nash. our results show the existence of a
network of mitochondrial proteins regulated by  xxxd3156xxx  that
participate in the pathogenesis of the disease.
materials and methods
materials. the following reagents and materials were used:
anti- xxxg569xxx  oxidase (cox) subunits i and ii antibodies
(molecular probes), anti-prohibitin 1 (phb1) antibody (calbiochem), anti-atp synthase ␤-subunit (molecular probes), electrophoresis reagents (bio-rad), trypsin (promega), urea and
collagenase (gibco兾brl), and thiourea (merck). all other
chemical reagents were from sigma. animals were from our
inbred colony and were treated humanely, according to our
institution’s guidelines. the human research review committee
of the hospital prı́ncipe de asturias approved this study.
high-throughput proteomic analysis. liver samples were homoge-

nized in 20 volumes of lysis buffer containing 7 m urea, 2 m
thiourea, 4% (vol兾vol) 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]1-propanesulfonate, 1% (vol兾vol) dtt, and 0.5% bio-lyte 3兾10
ampholytes. the homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 ⫻ g for
45 min at 15°c. protein concentration was determined in the
supernatants with the bradford assay kit (bio-rad) by using
albumin diluted in lysis buffer as standard. first-dimensional isoelectrofocusing was performed on a protean ief cell (bio-rad) by
using 17-cm readystrips ipg strips (bio-rad) with different ph
ranges. sample (300–700 ␮g of protein) was loaded, and active
rehydration was performed for 12 h at 50 v and 20°c. gels were
run for 60,000 v䡠h by using a progressively increasing protocol
implemented by the manufacturer. ipg strips were equilibrated in
50 mm tris䡠hcl, ph 7.5兾6 m urea兾30% (vol/vol) glycerol兾2%
(vol/vol) sds兾2% (vol/vol) dtt and then incubated in the same
buffer containing 2.5% iodoacetamide and bromophenol blue, in
the absence of dtt. ipg strips were directly loaded onto 12.5%
polyacrylamide gels (18 cm ⫻ 20 cm ⫻ 1 mm) and sealed with low
melting point agarose. second-dimensional sds兾page gels were
run for 15 h. gels were stained with phastgel blue r prepared in
65% h2o兾25% ethanol兾10% acetic acid. alternatively, silver staining was performed by using the silver staining kit from amersham
pharmacia. images were digitized with a bio-rad imaging densitometer and analyzed by using pdquest software. qualitative and
quantitative differences were detected and were only accepted
when at least a twofold change was confirmed in five independent
experiments. gel spots corresponding to proteins differentially
expressed were picked up manually and processed on a massprep
station from micromass (manchester, u.k.). gel specimens were
destained with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate兾50% (vol/vol)
acetonitrile (coomassie-stained gels) or 15 mm potassium ferricyanide兾50 mm sodium thiosulphate (silver-stained gels). then,
proteins were reduced with 10 mm dtt in 100 mm ammonium
bicarbonate and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide in the same
buffer. in-gel protein digestion was performed with 6 ng兾␮l trypsin
in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 5 h at 37°c. the resulting
peptides were extracted with 1% (vol/vol) formic acid兾2% (vol/vol)
acetonitrile. finally, 2-␮l samples were mixed with 2 ␮l of a
saturated solution of ␣-cyano-4-hydroxy-transcinnamic acid in tri3066 兩 www.pnas.org兾cgi兾doi兾10.1073兾pnas.0536625100

fluoroacetic acid 0.1%兾50% (vol/vol) acetonitrile and spotted into
a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (maldi) target plate.
tryptic digests were then analyzed on a maldi–time-of-flight
(tof) gl-ref mass spectrometer (micromass). data processing
was performed with masslynx, and database searching (swissprot, trembl, ensembl) to identify the proteins of interest from
their peptide fingerprint was performed with proteinlynx
global server (micromass). data analysis and clustering was
performed with garban. this system is implemented with bioinformatic tools that organize large amounts of genes and proteins
into biologically relevant clusters and classify them according to the
ontological criteria of the gene ontology consortium (l. a.
martı́nez-cruz, a.r., and j.m.m., unpublished work).
isolation and culture of rat hepatocytes. hepatocytes were isolated
from male wistar rats (200–250 g) by collagenase perfusion, as
described (31). after isolation, hepatocytes were cultured according to garcı́a-trevijano et al. (19) in the presence or absence
of 100 ␮m methionine兾4 mm adomet兾20 mm  xxxd1778xxx 
(cl) for the indicated periods of time. cell viability was measured by trypan blue exclusion, and no significant differences
were observed at any time between controls and any of the
various treatments performed in this study.
mitochondrial isolation and characterization. an enriched mitochon-

drial fraction was obtained from 100-mg liver specimens with the
mitochondria isolation kit from sigma by two consecutive centrifugation steps (600 ⫻ g and 11,000 ⫻ g, respectively). the electrochemical proton gradient (⌬␺) of the inner mitochondrial membrane was tested by measuring uptake of the f luorescent
carbocyanine dye jc-1 (sigma) into the mitochondria, following the
procedure indicated by the manufacturer. briefly, samples of the
mitochondrial suspension containing 5–40 ␮g of protein were
incubated for 7 min in the dark with 0.3 ␮m jc-1 in the presence
of 10 mm sodium succinate. fluorescence measurements were
performed with a perkin–elmer ls 50 b spectrofluorimeter.
rna isolation and northern hybridization analysis. total liver rna

was isolated by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (19). rna
concentration was determined spectrophotometrically before use,
and the integrity was checked by electrophoresis with subsequent
ethidium bromide staining. electrophoresis and gel blotting were
carried out as described (22). the phb1 cdna was cloned by
reverse transcriptase-pcr from mouse liver. the superscript preamplification system (life technologies, grand island, ny), taq
long plus enzyme (stratagene), and the mouse prohibitin sense
5⬘-atggctgccaaagtgtttgagtc-3⬘ antisense 5⬘-tcactggggaagctggagaagc3⬘primers were used. probes for the atpase ␤-subunit and cox
subunits i and ii have been described (32, 33). northern hybridization analyses were performed on total rna by using standard
procedures, as described (22). all probes were labeled with
[32p]dctp by using the rediprime dna labeling system (amersham pharmacia). to ensure equal loading of rna samples,
membranes were also hybridized with a 32p-labeled 18s rrna
cdna probe. autoradiography and densitometry were used to
quantitate relative rna. results of northern blot analysis were
normalized to 18s rrna.
dna isolation and southern blot analysis. total dna was extracted
from the livers of 3-month-old wt and  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, as
described (33). total cellular dna (20 ␮g) was digested with
ecori. the digested dna was resolved on 1% agarose gel,
transferred, and fixed onto nylon membranes. the membranes were
incubated with a cox ii [32p]dctp-labeled probe. conditions for
hybridization and membrane washing were as described (33).
western blot analysis. protein extraction and western blotting

were performed as described (34, 35). equal amounts of protein

santamarı́a et al.

(15 ␮g) were resolved in sds兾12.5% polyacrylamide gels. proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were probed with anti-mat (35), antiphb1, anti-atpase ␤, and anti-cox i and ii. a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used. blots were
developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (dupont).

the development of nash in the liver of  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mouse by a
high-throughput proteomic approach. protein expression patterns
were obtained by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-de) analysis
of liver extracts from 1-, 15-, 90-, and 240-day-old wt and
 xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. five independent experiments were performed
by using liver extracts from different animals. based on the results
of the image analysis with pdquest (bio-rad), an average of
1,500–2,000 spots were visualized, depending on the gel staining
procedure. wt and ko gel images (see fig. 6, which is published
as supporting information on the pnas web site, www.pnas.org)
were compared to determine the differences of protein expression,
and changes were only accepted when at least a twofold increase or
decrease was confirmed in all five experiments. our analysis
revealed that 1 day after birth, 140 differences were already induced
in the liver of  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, and that changes accumulate with
age (242, 259, and 297 differences by 15, 90, and 240 days,
respectively; see fig. 7, which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site). the distribution between up-regulated
and down-regulated proteins is maintained up to 3 months; 53–70%
were up-regulated and 30–47% were down-regulated proteins. in
contrast, this pattern switches in 8-month-old ko liver, when
nash has already developed, where 27% were up-regulated and
73% were down-regulated proteins (see fig. 7). from all of the
original changes, because of technical reasons, only the most
abundant proteins represented in the databases were identified by
peptide mass fingerprinting, resulting in 117 proteins successfully
identified (see table 1, which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site). consequently, alterations other than
those reported in this study might also participate in the development of nash in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. we have found a linear
correlation between the mr and pi calculated from the sequence of
the identified proteins and the experimental relative electrophoretic mobility (rf) of the corresponding spot, calculated from
the 2-de gels (see fig. 8, which is published as supporting information on the pnas web site). this finding further validates the
identity of the analyzed spots. some pi deviations of linearity were
observed, which is likely a consequence of posttranslational modifications. the specific protein expression profile of the  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺
liver provides a proteomic fingerprint of nash (see fig. 6). upand down-regulated proteins were classified by the biological
processes in which they are involved according to the gene ontology
criteria and were represented as shown in fig. 1. most proteins
differentially expressed in the ko liver clustered into three biological processes (fig. 1): cell communication (group 1), cell growth
and兾or maintenance (group 2), and developmental processes
(group 3). some of the identified proteins in these clusters are
tubulin ␣ 6 chain, tubulin ␤ 5 chain, actin, and phb1, which control
dna synthesis and regulate cell proliferation. these proteins are
involved in embryogenesis, morphogenesis, and aging. additionally,
proteins involved in response to stress, such as leukotriene a4
hydrolase (lkha), heat shock cognate 71, and heat shock protein
75, are up-regulated. changes in the expression pattern of proteins

involved in oxidative stress were also identified, for example,
glutathione peroxidase, antioxidant protein 1 and 2 (aop2), or
cu2⫹兾zn2⫹ superoxide dismutase (sodc). finally, according to
the broad metabolic activity of the liver, 80% of the proteins whose
expression changes in ko mouse correspond to metabolic enzymes.
most of the alterations affect carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid
metabolism. for example, fructose 1,6 biphosphatase (upregulated) and glycerol 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (downregulated) are key enzymes in gluconeogenesis and glycolysis,
respectively. acyl coa dehydrogenase long chain specific (acdl)
and ⌬3,5 ⌬2,4 dienoyl coa isomerase (both down-regulated) are
involved in fatty acid ␤-oxidation.  xxxg173xxx  (apa1;
up-regulated) and  xxxd2086xxx  synthetase (downregulated) participate in cholesterol transport and biosynthesis,
respectively, and  xxxg1739xxx  and isocitrate dehydrogenase (both down-regulated) catalyze two steps of the citrate cycle.
in addition, major differences affecting branched, aromatic, and
sulfur amino acid metabolism were identified (see fig. 9, which is
published as supporting information on the pnas web site). a
group of 12 proteins changed their expression pattern 1 day after
birth, and this alteration is maintained along the progression of
nash in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ liver (fig. 1). these proteins, which can be
considered as early markers of nash, were identified as apa1,
lkha, selenium binding protein, aop2, mat, keratin type 1

cytoskeletal 18,  xxxd2244xxx  methyltransferase, phb1,
sodc, albumin, acdl, and atpase ␤-subunit. most of these
proteins are metabolic enzymes or participate in the antioxidant
response of the ko hepatocyte. interestingly, phb1 and atpase
␤-subunit are mitochondrial proteins, and changes in their expression might compromise mitochondrial function.
 xxxd3156xxx  regulates a network of mitochondrial proteins and mitochondrial function. alteration of mitochondrial function might be a

key factor in the progression of nash in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice.
up-regulation (450 ⫾ 37%) of atpase ␤-subunit and downregulation (53 ⫾ 3%) of phb1 were confirmed by western blot
analysis with specific antibodies (fig. 2). additionally, the steadystate levels of subunits i and ii of cox were also diminished in ko
liver (55 ⫾ 7% and 53 ⫾ 5%, respectively; fig. 2). these alterations
were not observed in other tissues (not shown). the expression of
genes encoding for these proteins was also investigated by northern
blot analysis. the mrna level of atpase ␤-subunit is increased
twofold in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ liver (fig. 2). in contrast, mrna levels of
phb1 and cox ii, as well as 16s rrna, were similar to those
found in the wt animals (fig. 2). these observations indicate that
the down-regulation of phb1 and cox subunits by  xxxd3156xxx 
involves posttranscriptional mechanisms. whereas phb1 is the
product of a nuclear gene, cox subunits are encoded by mitochondrial genes. additionally, no changes on mitochondrial dna
content were observed in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ liver (fig. 2). changes on the
expression profile of phb1, cox, and atpase proteins suggest a
deficiency in mitochondrial respiration. the mitochondrial inner
membrane potential was measured in an enriched mitochondrial
fraction purified from liver extracts of wt and  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice. a
40% reduction of the electrochemical proton gradient was assessed
in the ko (fig. 3), indicating a deficiency of the mitochondrial inner
membrane integrity.
regulation of phb1 by  xxxd3156xxx . next, we investigated whether

 xxxd3156xxx  regulates phb1 levels in cultured rat hepatocytes. in
the presence of methionine or  xxxd3156xxx  in the culture media, no
effect on phb1 protein levels was detected after a 24-h incubation under standard conditions (fig. 4). however, impairment
of  xxxd3156xxx  synthesis by restriction of methionine or addition of
cl, a well known inhibitor of mat activity (36), to the culture
media resulted in the down-regulation of phb1 (51 ⫾ 4% and

phb1 and cox i and ii levels in ob/ob mice and obese patients. to

evaluate whether the alterations observed in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice
provide hitherto unknown mechanisms by which nash may be
induced, the steady-state levels of phb1 and cox were investigated in liver samples from ob兾ob mice and obese patients; individuals with these conditions are prone to the development of
nash. western blot analysis revealed that phb1 and cox i and
ii are down-regulated in ob兾ob liver by 76 ⫾ 8%, 81 ⫾ 3%, and 70 ⫾
5%, respectively. down-regulation of phb1 (53 ⫾ 4%) and cox
i (82 ⫾ 5%) was also confirmed in the liver of obese patients,
although the cox ii level was similar to that found in control liver
(fig. 5). similar to  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice, the mrna levels of phb,
cox i, and cox ii in ob兾ob mice and obese patients are
unchanged from normal controls (not shown).
discussion
 xxxd3156xxx  generally has been considered as a central intermediary
metabolite involved in the synthesis of homocysteine and polyamines, as well as the main cellular methyl group donor (2).
however, recent evidence indicates that, in addition to its central
metabolic function,  xxxd3156xxx  functions in the liver as an intracellular control switch that regulates essential hepatocyte functions such as proliferation, differentiation, and death (26). to
better understand the mechanisms by which these nontraditional

fig. 4. regulation of phb1 levels by  xxxd3156xxx  in cultured rat hepatocytes.
phb1 levels were measured in rat hepatocytes cultured for 12 or 24 h in the
presence or absence of 100 ␮m methionine兾4 mm  xxxd3156xxx  or 20 mm  xxxd1778xxx . (right)  xxxd3156xxx  (4 mm) was added after 12-h culture in a methioninedeficient media. liver extracts (15 ␮g per lane) were analyzed by western
blotting by using specific antibodies. phb1 was down-regulated by 51 ⫾ 4%
and 56 ⫾ 8% by the restriction of methionine or the addition of  xxxd1778xxx ,
respectively. equal protein loading was assured by red ponceau staining of
membranes (not shown). a representative blot from three independent experiments is shown.

functions of  xxxd3156xxx  take place, we studied the pathogenesis of
nash in ko mice deficient in hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  synthesis
( xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺) by using a high-throughput proteomic approach.
analysis of the differential protein expression profile of
 xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ and wt mice indicates that a chronic deficiency in
 xxxd3156xxx  synthesis has a pleiotropic effect in liver that alters
essential hepatic functions. the initial depletion of  xxxg1378xxx 
might result in changes in liver cell populations other than
hepatocytes, which may also contribute to the development of
nash. we have identified 117 proteins that are differentially
expressed in the liver of  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice during the development of nash (see table 1). the global analysis of the observed
differences indicates up-regulation of antioxidant proteins
(sodc, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) in the  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺
liver that might reflect an adaptive mechanism to dissipate
oxidative stress generated by oxidant genes (22, 28). major
metabolic alterations were also found at protein expression level
in the ko liver. lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism
is impaired in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice from birth, although differences
accumulate during the development of nash. these up- and
down-regulated proteins provide a specific proteomic profile
that might explain some of the metabolic alterations reminiscent
of those found in obesity and other conditions associated
with nash, which lead to development of cirrhosis and hcc
(37–39).
the analysis of the 117 proteins differentially expressed on
 xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ liver revealed that most of the changes detected 1 day
after birth are not maintained during the development of nash.
these time-dependent differences may reflect the adaptation of
the hepatocyte to performing its normal biological function
under a chronic deficiency of  xxxd3156xxx , leading to the accumulation of alterations that condition the development of the
disease. however, 12 proteins change their expression pattern
after birth, when  xxxg1378xxx  is switched on in wt mice, and this
alteration is maintained to the onset of histological lesions.
among these early changes are the up-regulation of sodc and
aop2, which was deduced from our two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-de) gels in accordance with earlier evidence (40), as
well as the down-regulation of acdl and up-regulation of
apa1. these alterations agree with the implication of oxidative
stress and abnormal lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of fatty
liver disease. interestingly, four proteins involved in mitochondrial function were also identified, atpase ␤, cox i and ii, and
phb1. transcriptional up-regulation of atpase ␤ has been
implicated in mitochondrial maturation and in cell neoplastic
transformation (41, 42), which is consistent with the proliferative
and de-differentiated state of  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ hepatocytes (22, 28).
translational down-regulation of cox indicates a deficient
transference of electrons to oxygen, the last step of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain, and therefore provides a
molecular explanation for the oxidative stress found in
 xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ liver (22, 28, 43). the fall in phb1 steady-state levels
might explain the down-regulation of cox. phb1 is the product
of a nuclear gene that is targeted to the inner mitochondrial
membrane (44). it has been proposed recently that phb1 is a
chaperone-like protein that participates in the correct folding
and assembly of some of the components of the mitochondrial
respiratory chain (45, 46). according to this hypothesis, a
deficiency in phb1 may impair the native and functional organization of respiratory proteins that are subsequently degraded
by mitochondrial proteases, compromising mitochondrial functionality (45, 46). therefore, the decrease of phb1 might
induce a reduction of cox, with the concomitant loss of
mitochondrial function in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ hepatocytes.
previous evidence correlates down-regulation of phb1 gene
expression with accelerating aging and age-related degenerative
diseases (46, 47). our results indicate that  xxxd3156xxx  regulates
phb1 levels, likely through a posttranslational mechanism, as

of our experiments with  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice indicate that phb1 and
cox fell long before any histological manifestation of the
disease was detected. furthermore, our data also suggest one of
the key mechanisms of  xxxd3156xxx ’s hepatoprotective action may
be to restore the expression of phb1. whether  xxxd3156xxx  might
be of benefit in the treatment of nash should be investigated
further.
in summary, our results provide a mechanism by which a
deficiency of  xxxd3156xxx  impairs mitochondrial function and generates oxidative stress in liver. the fall of phb1 leading to a
mitochondrial failure, together with abnormal lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism might explain, at least in part,
the pathogenesis of nash.

deduced from the observation that mrna content of phb1
remains normal in liver under a chronic deficiency of  xxxd3156xxx .
the correlation between a deficiency of  xxxd3156xxx  synthesis and
down-regulation of phb1 found in  xxxg1378xxx ⫺/⫺ mice was confirmed by the in vitro experiments on isolated rat hepatocytes.
reduction of  xxxd3156xxx  synthesis by using a culture media without
methionine or in the presence of cl, an inhibitor of mat
activity (36), results in the down-regulation of phb1. replenishment of hepatocyte  xxxd3156xxx  content prevented the fall of
phb1. the mechanism by which  xxxd3156xxx  regulates phb1 levels
requires further investigation. however, phosphorylation of
phb1 has been reported in human fibroblasts (48) and in
hormone-treated ovarian cells (49), and the ability to posttranslationally phosphorylate phb1 is lost during the process of
cellular aging (48).
phb1 steady-state levels are also decreased in the liver of
ob兾ob mice and in obese patients who are predisposed to develop
nash. nash is a chronic disorder with an increasing prevalence in the population and is fast becoming one of the most
significant and common disorders of clinical hepatology (37).
the pathogenesis of nash is poorly understood, but present
evidence supports mitochondrial alterations correlating with
oxidative stress as one of the most important factors (37, 50).
down-regulation of phb1 and cox induced by a chronic
deficiency of hepatic  xxxd3156xxx  may provide new molecular
mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of nash. the results
