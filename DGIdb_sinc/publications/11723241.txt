the hereditary long qt syndrome (lqts) is caused by
mutations in five known genes, four of which encode  xxxg1232xxx  subunits (keating and sanguinetti, 2001). two
gene products,  xxxg1268xxx  and mink produce ␣ and ␤ subunits
of the slowly activating cardiac delayed-rectifier potassium
current iks. (wang et al., 1996a; splawski et al., 1997). the
human ether-a-go-go related gene herg (warmke and
ganetzky, 1994) encodes the major subunit of the rapidly
activating cardiac delayed-rectifier  xxxg1232xxx  (sanguinetti et al., 1995). mutations in herg cause chromosome
7-linked lqts (curran et al., 1995) and link structural
changes in delayed rectifying potassium channels to prolongation of the cardiac action potential, of the qt interval, and
of electrocardiogram readings.
herg k⫹ channels have unique pharmacological properties and are blocked with high affinity and selectivity by

introduced c-type inactivation into noninactivating beag using
site-directed mutagenesis. two point mutations in the pore
region, t432s and a443s, were sufficient to produce c-type
inactivation. low concentrations of dofetilide produced block
of beag t432s/a443s; unlike herg, block was almost irreversible. substitution of an additional amino acid in transmembrane domain s6 made the block reversible. dofetilide blocked
the triply mutated beag t432s/a443s/a453s with an ic50
value of 1.1 ␮m. the blocking potency was 30-fold greater than
beag wt and about one third that of herg wt. we conclude
that high affinity methanesulfonanilide binding to herg channels is strongly dependent on c-type inactivation.

dofetilide, mk-499, and e4031 (jurkiewicz and sanguinetti,
1993; trudeau et al., 1995; kiehn et al., 1996; snyders and
chaudhary, 1996; spector et al., 1996). the binding site that
has been proposed (lees-miller et al., 2000; mitcheson et al.,
2000b) makes herg k⫹ channels a major target for block by
nonantiarrhythmic drugs, including the antihistamines terfenadine (e.g., roy et al., 1996) and  xxxd236xxx  (zhou et al.,
1999), and the gastrointestinal prokinetic drug  xxxd1708xxx 
(e.g., rampe et al., 1997), that cause drug-induced lqts as
an unwanted side effect.
previous structure-function studies of high-affinity drug
binding in herg k⫹ channels provided evidence that intact
c-type inactivation is crucial for drug binding, because many
mutations that disrupted inactivation dramatically reduced
the sensitivity to methanesulfonanilide drugs, most probably
because of allosteric changes induced in the drug binding site
(wang et al., 1997b; ficker et al., 1998; herzberg et al., 1998;
lees-miller et al., 2000). similarly, it has been demonstrated
that high-affinity drug binding can be modulated by extracellular cations such as k⫹, na⫹, or cd2⫹, all of which modify
inactivation gating of herg k⫹ channels (wang et al., 1997;
numaguchi et al., 2000).

abstract
the major subunit of the cardiac delayed rectifier current ikr is
encoded by the human ether a-go-go related gene (herg).
herg/ikr channels are blocked selectively by class iii antiarrhythmic methanesulfonanilide drugs such as dofetilide. the
binding site for methanesulfonanilides is believed to be similar
for nonantiarrhythmic drugs such as antihistamines, antibiotics,
and antipsychotics. to gain further insight into the binding site,
we examined the minimal structural changes necessary to
transform low-affinity binding of dofetilide by the related bovine
ether a-go-go channel beag to high-affinity binding of herg.
previously, it was shown that high-affinity binding in herg
required intact c-type inactivation; the bovine ether a-go-go k⫹
channel (beag), unlike herg, is noninactivating. therefore, we

construction of mutant channels. herg wt cdna was a gift
from dr. m. t. keating (university of utah, salt lake city, ut).
beag wt cdna was provided by dr. a. baumann (forschungszentrum juelich, juelich, germany). all point mutations in herg and
beag were generated by overlap extension polymerase chain reactions using polymerase chain reaction-generated mlui-kpni cassettes anchored in pbluescript as template (ficker et al., 1998).
before subcloning, the cassettes were sequenced. crna was pre-

pared using the mmessage mmachine in vitro transcription kit (ambion, austin, tx) and sp6 polymerase after linearization with ecori
(herg wt, and point mutations in herg) or ecorv (beag wt,
and point mutations in beag).
electrophysiology. isolation, maintenance, and injection of xenopus laevis oocytes were performed as described previously (ficker
et al., 1998). whole-cell currents were recorded 2 to 7 days after
crna injection using standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp
techniques. bath solutions were 96 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1.8 mm
cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2, 5 mm hepes (5k ringer, ph 7.4) and 1.8 mm
cacl2, 10 mm hepes with either 115 mm kcl (115k ringer, ph
7.4), 115 mm rbcl (115rb ringer, ph 7.4), 115 mm cscl (115cs
ringer, ph 7.4), or 115 mm nacl (115na ringer, nominally k⫹-free,
ph 7.4). bath solutions containing 100 mm [k]ex, 30 mm [k]ex, and
5 mm [k]ex with 30 mm tea added were prepared by equivalent
reductions in the concentration of nacl in 5k ringer or by omission
of kcl for a nominally k⫹-free 100na ringer. for ic50 measurements, dofetilide was perfused in increasing concentrations with 5k
ringer. dofetilide was provided by pfizer central research (groton,
ct). all other chemicals were obtained from sigma (st. louis, mo).
macropatch recordings were performed using an epc-7 patch clamp
amplifier (list, darmstadt, germany). patch pipettes had resistances of 0.2 to 0.6 m⍀ and were filled with 5k ringer (see above).
for patch recordings the bath solution had the following composition: 100 mm kcl, 5 mm edta, 5 mm egta, 10 mm hepes (isok,
ph 7.4). no leak subtraction was applied. all recordings were performed at room temperature (20–22°c). pclamp software (axon instruments, foster city, ca) was used for the generation of voltage
clamp pulses and for data acquisition. when appropriate, data were
expressed as mean ⫾ s.e.m.

results
pore mutations that introduce c-type inactivation
in beag. several reports have shown that amino acid residues in positions 620 and 631 are crucial for c-type inactivation in herg channels (schoenherr and heinemann,
1996; smith et al., 1996; ficker et al., 1998; herzberg et al.,
1998). to introduce c-type inactivation in beag, we placed
serines at position 432 or 443 of beag because these positions are equivalent to s620 and s631 in herg. neither
beag a443s nor beag t432s introduced the inactivating
current phenotype that was desired (ficker et al., 1998).
however, a combination of the two point mutations beag
t432s and a443s successfully introduced the desired phenotype. with depolarizing voltage commands, a rapidly activating and inactivating outward current was elicited (fig. 1a).
the current-voltage relationship was bell-shaped (fig. 1b).
deactivation of the tail currents was also rapid. current
inactivation persisted after excision of the membrane patch
into divalent and na⫹-free isok⫹ ringer solution (fig. 1c).
in cell-attached macropatches, currents decayed monoexponentially. time constants were voltage-dependent with
24.5 ⫾ 1.7, 19.3 ⫾ 1.0, and 15.5 ⫾ 1.1 ms (n ⫽ 6) measured
at membrane potentials of ⫺20, 0, and ⫹20 mv, respectively.
these values were about double the time constants measured
in macropatch recordings of herg wt. in herg, time constants were 12.4 ⫾ 0.6, 10.6 ⫾ 0.5, and 7.4 ⫾ 0.6 ms at ⫺20,
0, and ⫹20 mv, respectively (n ⫽ 6). the difference in time
constants may be related to the different voltage protocols
that were used. in beag t432s/a443s, we analyzed current
inactivation using depolarizing voltage commands at which
channel activation and inactivation proceeded simultaneously (fig. 1a). in herg, a three-step pulse protocol was
used that isolated inactivation from activation (smith et al.,

major progress toward a structural basis of high-affinity
drug binding has recently been made with the identification
of two crucial aromatic amino acid residues in the s6 transmembrane domain of the channel protein: herg y652 and
f656. these two amino acids seem to constitute a major part
of the methanesulfonanilide binding site in herg with additional contributions being made by residue  xxxg648xxx  in s6 and
residues t623 and v625 in the pore helix of the herg
channel protein (lees-miller et al., 2000; mitcheson et al.,
2000b). these residues face the conduction pathway, and are
accessible only in the open state and drug molecules are
trapped inside the conduction pathway by closure of the
activation gate (mitcheson et al., 2000a,b).
with localization of the receptor for high-affinity drug
binding to the s6 transmembrane domain, the role played by
c-type inactivation in enhancing drug binding is problematic
for the following reasons: 1) mutations such as herg s620t,
in which inactivation has been completely removed, showed
dramatically lowered drug-sensitivity despite the availability
of f656 and y652 (ficker et al., 1998); 2) all residues important for drug binding are conserved in the closely related,
noninactivating eag k⫹ channels yet eag channels are
relatively insensitive to block by dofetilide or mk-499 (ficker
et al., 1998; herzberg et al., 1998; mitcheson et al., 2000b); 3)
mutations at several of the binding loci (e.g., herg g648a,
t623a, f656a) showed a large negative shift in inactivation
(i.e., increased inactivation); contrary to expectations, however, they were less sensitive to drug block than wt channels
(mitcheson et al., 2000b); and 4) some mutations that completely removed inactivation remained rather sensitive to
methanesulfonanilide block (e.g., herg s620c or herg
g628c/s631c; wang et al., 1997; ficker et al., 1998;
mitcheson et al., 2000b). these inconsistencies show that the
interaction between inactivation and the pore lining residues
implicated in drug binding is not understood.
in the present experiments, we examined this interaction
by addressing the difference in drug sensitivity between
herg and eag channels. we mutated the noninactivating
eag family member beag, which is about 100-fold less
sensitive to dofetilide than herg, by substitution of two
amino acids at positions 432 and 443 in the pore region.
these mutations introduced herg-like c-type inactivation
and high-affinity dofetilide binding simultaneously. however, block by dofetilide was almost irreversible, even at low
concentrations, unlike the situation in herg. to convert
beag t432s/a443s into a channel that was blocked reversibly by dofetilide, we mutated one additional residue in the
s6 transmembrane helix. taken together, our results show
that introducing c-type inactivation into beag was sufficient to transform the low affinity methanesulfonanilide
binding site of beag into a high-affinity site resembling
herg channels.

herg-like inactivation and dofetilide blockade in beag

1996). for similar reasons, fractional inactivation differed
between the two channels. at more hyperpolarized membrane potentials, at which current activation was slow, beag
t432s/a443s currents seemed to inactivate much less than
herg wt currents. at more depolarizing potentials, however, at which activation was considerably faster, fractional
inactivation approached the values measured for herg wt
channels. in marked contrast, the inactivation process in
herg s631a was shifted to more positive values (fig. 1d;
see zou et al., 1998). in addition, the time course for recovery
from inactivation was equally fast in beag t432s/a443s
and herg wt. at ⫺80 mv, the time constant for recovery
from inactivation was 17.1 ⫾ 2.1 ms (n ⫽ 4; fig. 1e) and is
comparable with the time constant of about 10 ms measured
at ⫺80 mv for herg wt (sanguinetti et al., 1995).

to demonstrate that c-type inactivation was introduced
into beag k⫹ channels, we tested the effects of extracellular
tea, elevated [k⫹]ex, and various extracellular monovalent
cations known to interfere with c-type inactivation (choi et
al., 1991; lopez-barneo et al., 1993; schoenherr and heinemann, 1996). tea at 30 mm blocked beag channels by
about 50% and produced the expected slowing of inactivation
over a wide range of potentials (fig. 2, a and b). likewise,
inactivation was slowed by elevated [k⫹]ex that at the same
time increased current amplitude (fig. 2, c and d). moreover, in high k⫹, it was apparent that the tail currents of
beag t432s/a443s no longer deactivated almost instantaneously. deactivation of tail currents was slowed sufficiently
that recovery from inactivation produced a clearly resolved
rising phase in inward tail currents that in herg wt channels was attributed to recovery from c-type inactivation. in
many potassium channels slowing of c-type inactivation by
extracellular cations followed the selectivity sequence for
permeation, namely k⫹⬃rb⫹ ⬎ cs⫹ ⬎ na⫹ (lopez-barneo
et al., 1993). we found that inactivation in beag t432s/
a443s was slowed most with rb⫹ and cs⫹ following the

t432s/a443s channels could be tested directly by the introduction of additional mutations that either slow deactivation
or induce reopenings at negative membrane potentials as
described for herg d540k (sanguinetti and xu, 1999).
along these lines, we described previously a herg/eag
chimera with beag s6 transplanted into herg background
(hbs6; ficker et al., 1998) that expressed a nonfunctional,
permanently opened activation gate combined with fully preserved c-type inactivation. hbs6 channels were more sensitive to block by dofetilide than herg wt channels with drug
block being reversible.
to quantify the increased sensitivity of beag channels to
dofetilide upon introduction of c-type inactivation, in the
present study, we engineered additional mutations in the
beag t432s/a443s background to achieve reversible blockade and measure half-maximal blocking concentrations. we
focused on two positions in the n-terminal half of s6 at which
hydrophilic s641 and  xxxd2602xxx  residues of herg were represented by hydrophobic a453 and a455 residues in beag.
beag t432s/a443s⫹a455c showed the behavior of beag
t432s/a443s with respect to kinetics, c-type inactivation,
and irreversible dofetilide binding (data not shown). in contrast, beag t432s/a443s⫹a453s activated slowly at potentials more negative than 20 mv and exhibited no detectable
inactivation. at potentials more depolarized than 20 mv,
however, channels inactivated and produced a crossover of
raw current traces (fig. 4a). the current-voltage relationship was bell-shaped (fig. 4b) and voltage-dependent inactivation was apparent when the holding potential was shifted
from ⫺80 to ⫺60 mv to accelerate current activation (fig.
4a, inset). onset of dofetilide block was slow, but in contrast

sequence rb⫹ ⱖ cs⫹⬎ k⫹ ⬎ na⫹ (fig. 2, e and f). as for
herg channels, inactivation in beag t432s/a443s was
strongly voltage-dependent (wang et al., 1996b).
dofetilide block of beag t432s/a443s. intact c-type
inactivation has been shown to be a prerequisite for highaffinity binding of methanesulfonanilide drugs in herg k⫹
channels (wang et al., 1997; ficker et al., 1998; herzberg et
al., 1998). consequently, single point mutations at beag 432
or beag 443 that express noninactivating currents failed to
produce high-affinity drug binding in beag. beag t432s
resulted in a channel only 4-fold more sensitive to dofetilide
than beag wt, whereas beag a443s currents were slightly
less sensitive than wt currents (table 1).
in contrast, inactivating beag t432s/a443s channels provided a unique tool to ask whether introduction of c-type
inactivation is sufficient to convert the low-affinity binding
site of beag into the high-affinity site of herg. block by
methanesulfonanilides was evaluated in two-microelectrode
recordings with a prepulse protocol to accelerate onset of
block. figure 3 shows beag t432s/a443s currents recorded
at 0 mv during perfusion of 1 ␮m dofetilide. onset of block
was slow and a well-defined steady-state level was not always attained. moreover, drug block was almost irreversible,
even after prolonged washout of more than 1 h (figs. 3 and
4d). to obtain estimates of dofetilide block in beag t432s/
a443s, we added 0.3 and 1 ␮m dofetilide to the extracellular
perfusate and extrapolated steady-state block by monoexponential fits to the time course of amplitude reductions.
dofetilide (1 ␮m) reduced current amplitudes to 20 ⫾ 4% of
control levels (n ⫽ 13). with 0.3 ␮m dofetilide, currents were
on average reduced to 38 ⫾ 2% (n ⫽ 3). for comparison, the
block of herg wt currents at 0 mv by 1 ␮m dofetilide was
superimposed on the time-dependent block of beag t432s/
a443s in fig. 3. the onset of block in herg was much faster
and the drug effects were reversible. on the other hand,
beag wt was insensitive to dofetilide at this concentration.
although a precise ic50 value could not be measured in
beag t432s/a443s, our experiments indicate that fairly low
concentrations of dofetilide significantly block beag t432s/
a443s currents with an ic50 ⬍ 1 ␮m. by contrast, the ic50 in
beag wt is 32 ␮m (table 1).
an explanation for the irreversible drug block in beag
t432s/a443s may be trapping of dofetilide in the inner vestibule by a rapidly closing activation gate. in herg channels, recovery from block is slow because of trapping by a gate
that closes much more slowly than in beag t432s/a443s
(mitcheson et al., 2000a). trapping of dofetilide in beag

discussion
mapping the binding site for dofetilide in herg channels
is complicated by tight coupling between binding and c-type
inactivation. to complement experiments done with “loss of
function” mutations in herg, we adopted a “gain of function” strategy in beag and showed that mutation of two
amino acid residues in the pore region introduced c-type
inactivation and high-affinity dofetilide binding.
successful transfer of c-type inactivation into beag relied
upon the analysis of structural inactivation determinants in
herg. in general, c-type inactivation is sensitive to mutations in or close to the pore region (e.g., hoshi et al., 1991;
lopez-barneo et al., 1993). c-type inactivation in herg was
altered by mutating position 631, a pore residue homologous
to shaker 449 in the external mouth of the pore (schoenherr
and heinemann, 1996). mutation of herg s620 to t620, a
residue located at the inner end of the pore helix and not
exposed to the conduction pathway as judged from doyle et
al. (1998) had even more pronounced effects, completely abolishing c-type inactivation (ficker et al., 1998; herzberg et
al., 1998). interestingly, herg s620 is homologous to position 369 in  xxxg1237xxx , a residue with large effects on current
inactivation (debiasi et al., 1993). these results raise the
question of how residues facing opposite sites of the membrane are involved in c-type inactivation. herg s631 localizes to the external mouth of the pore and by analogy with
shaker 449 is believed to control access of external ions to a
more internally located c-type inactivation site (molina et
al., 1997). herg s620 might affect c-type inactivation by
contributing to ion occupancy at a critical site in the selectivity filter as demonstrated for shaker a463c (ogielska and
aldrich, 1999). the proposition that both herg620 and
herg631 regulate ion occupancy at the c-type inactivation
site (herzberg et at., 1998), is further supported by our results with reverse mutations in beag. neither beag t432s
nor beag a443s alone expressed c-type inactivating currents, whereas the combination of both mutations in beag
t432s/a443s introduced an inactivation process with the
hallmarks of c-type inactivation.
given the tight coupling between c-type inactivation and
high-affinity drug binding in herg, our results showed, not
unexpectedly, that c-type inactivating beag t432s/a443s
and beag t432s/a443s/a543s channels were blocked by
low concentrations of dofetilide. previous work in shaker k⫹
channels suggested that conformational changes of c-type
inactivation were restricted to the selectivity filter (liu et al.,
1996; molina et al., 1997; harris et al., 1998). by contrast,
critical structural determinants for high-affinity drug binding in herg have been located to positions 652 and 656 in
the s6 transmembrane domain, positions that are conserved
in eag channels (lees-miller et al., 2000; mitcheson et al.,
2000). how, then, can c-type inactivation communicate with
a drug-binding site controlled by s6 residues facing the internal vestibule and conduction pathway? one possibility is
that c-type inactivation interacts with a rotational move-

several minutes. the block was now reversible; fig. 4d
shows the washout after the application of 10 ␮m dofetilide,

ment of s6 during activation making crucial residues in s6
accessible for drug binding. in the closed state of the herg
channel, these residues are hidden consistent with the absence of resting block by methanesulfonanilides (kiehn et al.,
1996; snyders and chaudhary, 1996). in shaker channels, it
has been shown that small changes in the size of a side chain
(shaker i470c) allow blockers suddenly to become trapped in
the closed state of the channel protein; it has been suggested
that structural differences between channels that do and do
not trap blockers are only minor (holmgren et al., 1997).
therefore, it is conceivable that point mutations affecting
c-type inactivation may change the size of the internal vestibule of channels in the eag gene family and thereby allow
or impede trapping of methanesulfonanilides. because trapping of high-affinity blockers has important consequences for
the reversibility of block in herg channels leading to accumulation of drug effects, it may be important in future experiments to determine the relationship between inner vestibule size, c-type inactivation, and drug binding more
precisely to develop new blocking molecules that might escape from their binding sites more readily.
