abstract
repeated stress triggers a wide range of adaptive changes in the central nervous system including the elevation of
serotonin (5-ht) metabolism and an increased susceptibility to affective disorders. to begin to examine whether these
changes are mediated by alterations in gene expression for tryptophan hydroxylase (tph), the rate-limiting enzyme in 5ht biosynthesis, we quantitated its mrna levels by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr). repeated immobilization stress (2 h, 7 days) elicited a six- or ten-fold rise in tph mrna in median raphe nucleus
(mrn) and dorsal raphe nucleus (drn), respectively, without signi®cantly altering tph mrna levels in the pineal gland.
in contrast, there was little change in mrna levels for  xxxg875xxx  (gtpch), the rate limiting enzyme in
synthesis of the tetrahydrobiopterin (bh4), the obligate cofactor for tph. this is the ®rst study to reveal stress-elicited
activation of tph gene expression. q 1999 elsevier science ireland ltd. all rights reserved.

stress reportedly alters serotonin (5-ht) metabolism in
the rat brain. thus, a number of psychological and physiological stresses like electric shock, immobilization, and
inescapable sound stresses increased 5-ht turnover as
measured by an elevation in the 5-hydroxyindole acetic
acid (5-hiaa) to 5-ht ratio in most of the areas innervated
by serotonergic neurons [1,4,6,10,12,13]. stress also altered
the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (tph), the rate limiting enzyme in 5-ht biosynthesis, in several brain regions.
speci®cally, repeated immobilization stress (imo)
increased rat tph enzymatic activity in serotonergic terminals in the locus coeruleus, and decreased its activity in the
suprachiasmatic nucleus, while not in¯uencing the tph
activity in the cell bodies of the dorsal raphe nucleus
(drn) [5]. moreover, sound stress increased tph activity
in the cortex and brainstem; a rise likely mediated by glucocorticoids because it was blocked by adrenalectomy and
restored by dexamethasone treatment [19]. these changes
in tph activity measured ex vivo could result from changes
in phosphorylation or increased enzyme levels.
alterations in tph mrna levels would suggest a
mechanism affecting tph synthesis, however, little is

known about the regulation of tph gene expression.
recently, glucocorticoids were found to regulate tph
mrna levels in a tissue-speci®c manner. in adrenalectomized rats, 7 days of dexamethasone treatment increased
tph mrna levels 16-fold above basal levels in the pineal
gland and decreased it by six-fold in raphe nuclei [3]. to our
knowledge there are no studies examining the effect of
stress on tph mrna levels.
in order to determine whether imo altered serotonin
biosynthesis by regulating tph gene expression, we
measured tph mrna levels in the major serotonergic
cell bodies innervating the rat forebrain. however, tph
mrna levels in the rat brain are very low and are nearly
undetectable by the conventional methods of northern blot
hybridization or nuclease protection assays, requiring pooling brainstem tissue from large numbers (®ve to ten) of
animals [3,7]. in situ hybridization has been used to determine the relative induction in tph mrna although this
approach cannot quantitate absolute mrna amounts [15].
therefore, we adapted the quantitative competitive reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) technique to sensitively measure the amount of tph mrna levels
in individual animals. in addition, in an attempt to assess
whether there is a coupling between the synthesis of tph
and the synthesis of its obligate cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin
(bh4), we determined, in the same tissue samples, mrna

fig. 1. immobilization stress increased tph mrna levels in both dorsal and median raphe nuclei. competitive rt-pcr was used to
quantitate tph mrna levels in samples of total rna from the drn and mrn. rt-pcr products were electrophorezed through 1.2%
agarose gels, blotted on nylon membranes, and hybridized to a tph speci®c probe. competitor and tph band intensities were measured
by densitometry within the linear range, and the competitor/tph ratio was plotted versus attomoles of competitor on a double log scale.
regression analysis was used to plot the best-®t line. tph concentration was determined at the point where the log competitor/tph ratio
equaled zero. (a) displays an example southern blot of the rt-pcr products from the drn beginning with x competitor concentration in

levels of  xxxg875xxx  (gtpch), the rate limiting
enzyme in the de novo biosynthesis of bh4. we previously
demonstrated that increased gtpch mrna levels accompanied the imo-triggered elevation of mrna levels for the
bh4 requiring enzyme,  xxxg2276xxx , in noradrenergic neurons [16].
male sprague±dawley rats (225±250 g, taconic) were
housed four per cage, maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark
cycle, and received food and water ad libitum. animals
were either handled (controls) or exposed to a daily 2-h
immobilization stress for 7 consecutive days (7£ imo) as
described earlier [17]. animals were euthanized immediately after the last episode of stress. the pineal was then
removed and the dorsal and median raphe nuclei were
punched out from a 1-mm thick slice (p7.1±8.0 from the
bregma) using a glass cannula with an inner diameter of 1.1
mm. the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and used for total rna preparation with rnazol [17].
to quantitate the amount of tph mrna with rt-pcr, a
625-bp construct was used as a competitor for endogenous
tph (a generous gift from a.f. russo). it was constructed
by inserting a 225-bp fragment of adenovirus intron dna
into a partial tph cdna (bases 942±1338, a 400-bp fragment) and subcloned into the pgem-t vector containing the

t7 and sp6 rna polymerase promoters. in vitro transcription generated the competitor rna. serial dilutions of the
competitor rna were added to the same amount of total
rna from drn, mrn or the pineal gland of individual
rats, and used to synthesize cdna by reverse transcription
(rt, 428c for 60 min). equal aliquots of the rt reaction
were then used for pcr. ampli®cation within the linear
range for both cdnas, was performed for 30 cycles as
follows: 948c for 1.5 min, 558c for 1 min, 728c for 2
min, and a ®nal 5 min incubation at 728c [3].
the effect of imo stress on tph mrna levels is shown
in fig. 1. repeated imo stress (7£ imo) increased the
average level of tph mrna 10.3-fold in the drn, from
1:56 ^ 0:39 to 16:1 ^ 3:5 amol/rat (p , 0:003). in the
median raphe nucleus (mrn), tph mrna levels were
0:92 ^ 0:24 amol/rat for control animals and were raised
to 5:8 ^ 0:65 amol/rat after 7£ imo, a 6.3-fold increase
(p , 0:0002).
since stress was found to elevate tph mrna levels in
the raphe nuclei, we examined if it also triggered changes in
gtpch mrna levels (fig. 2). northern blot hybridization
showed that in the drn, levels of both gtpch mrna
species (1.2 and 3.6 kb) were similar in control and immobilized animals. however, in the mrn, the 3.6 kb gtpch

total mrna was isolated from control and animals subjected to
2-h imo, repeated for 7 consecutive days. hybridizations were
performed with rat gtpch crna probe. the single-strand antisense crna was transcribed with by using t7 rna polymerase
with [ 32p] a -utp (800 ci/nmol), followed by phenol chloroform
extraction. the same membrane was rehybridized with dna
probe for 18s rrna. control levels of gtpch/18s mrnas was
taken as 1. *p , 0:05 vs. control.

mrna species showed a slight, but signi®cant (p , 0:05),
increase in the immobilized animals while the 1.2 kb species
was not affected.
the ®nding that tph mrna levels are markedly
elevated in the raphe nuclei suggests that the increase in
serotonergic activity and 5-ht turnover in response to
imo stress could be mediated by elevated tph gene expression. heightened tph mrna levels in response to stress
were observed both in the drn and mrn. the basal levels
of tph mrna in the mrn are about two-fold lower than in
the drn, consistent with the lower density of 5-ht neurons
in this location [11].
tph mrna levels were much higher in the pineal gland
than in the brain stem, in agreement with other studies (fig.
1c) [3]. exposure to repeated imo did not signi®cantly alter
the tph and mrna levels in the pineal (1868 ^ 99 amol/
pineal for control and 1458 ^ 246 amol/pineal for imo,
p # 0:13). moreover, pineal gtpch mrna levels were
also not altered by the stress (fig. 2c). these ®ndings are
unexpected knowing that imo stress activates the hpa axis
and hence increases circulating glucocorticoid levels. both
tph and gtpch genes were shown to be regulated by
glucocorticoids. in the pineal gland, tph mrna levels
were elevated by 16-fold upon 7 days treatment with glucocorticoids [3]. in the adrenals, immobilization stress
elevated the levels of both gtpch mrna species, however
this rise was abolished by hypophysectomy [18]. in addition, cortisol treatment for 1 or 7 days elevated gtpch
mrna levels in the rat adrenal medulla, and dexametha-

159

sone raised gtph mrna levels in pc12 cells. these
changes were shown to be transcriptionally mediated [17].
consequently, stress-elicited regulation of tph and
gtpch gene transcription seems to be more complex
than a regulation by glucocorticoids. there could be a
different mechanism of regulation of the tph and gtpch
genes in the brain and in the pineal gland.
immobilization stress increased the steady-state tph
mrna levels in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei of the
rat brainstem by ten- and six-fold, respectively. while both
these regions displayed robust induction of tph mrna, it
remains to be determined whether the difference in the
extent of induction is meaningful. we postulate that
increased tph mrna in the raphe nuclei leads to heightened tph activity and 5-ht metabolism, although the
extent of the elevation of tph mrna levels was much
larger than the change in 5-ht turnover. microdialysis
studies showed tissue-speci®c changes in extracellular serotonin levels upon exposure to different types of stressors.
for example, conditioned fear stress following a single footshock session increased 5-ht metabolism in the medial
prefrontal cortex [10]. psychological stress increased 5ht release in the rat amygdala and prefrontal cortex as
well [12], while a single immobilization stress did not
alter extracellular 5-ht but did increase 5-hiaa levels by
60% in the hippocampus and by 25% in the striatum [13].
we speculate that differential imo-elicited increase in tph
mrna in the drn and the mrn could be re¯ected in
difference in 5-ht turnover among various brain regions.
one could speculate that the elevation of tph mrna
levels in the drn and mrn, and the downstream changes
in serotonin metabolism, are involved in the adaptive and
maladaptive effects of stress. notably, serotonin is involved
in mediating the behavioral and endocrine consequences of
stress [2,8]. stress also increases norepinephrine turnover in
the brain, and when prolonged or repeated, elevates the gene
expression of the norepinephrine synthesizing enzymes
(reviewed in ref. [14]). the long-term changes in gene
expression of serotonin and the norepineprhine synthesizing
enzymes by repeated imo stress may thus be involved in the
stress-induced susceptibility to depression. clinically,
alterations in the serotonergic and adrenergic systems
have been implicated in affective disorders, particularly
depression and anxiety [9].
the molecular mechanism responsible for the observed
rise in tph mrna levels caused by stress remains to be
determined. the presently observed increase in tph mrna
levels with stress could have resulted from either increased
mrna stability or heightened transcription.
tph mrna exists in a number of alternatively spliced
forms that differ mostly in the non-coding region. however,
two alternatively spliced forms of human tph were found
to differ in the 3 0 end of the open reading frame, giving rise
to the presence or absence of a putative  xxxd1773xxx -dependent protein kinase phosphorylation site [20]. there are
reports of at least three tph mrna species having the

160

same coding region with differing 3 0 utr sequences, which
are differentially expressed in the raphe nuclei and the
pineal gland of the rat [7]. these sequence variations
could lead to differences in mrna stability as well as in
translational ef®ciency. moreover, the rat tph gene has two
distinct promoter regions, one distal and one proximal [7].
while transcription from the proximal promoter predominates, both promoters are utilized in the pineal gland and the
raphe nuclei. consequently, it is attractive to speculate that
these promoters may be involved in the tissue-speci®c
differential activation of tph reported in this study. it
remains to be determined whether there is a selective tph
promoter that is activated by stress.
