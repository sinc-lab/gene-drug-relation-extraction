abstract
this paper investigates how bst204, a fermented  xxxd2200xxx , affects the expression and mechanism of
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2). bst204 was prepared by incubating crude  xxxd2200xxx  with ginsenoside-h-glucosidase.
unexpectedly, bst204 had no effect on the level of cox-2 protein in unstimulated raw 264.7 cells, and it suppressed the
level of cox-2 protein and pge2 production in lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated raw 264.7 cells. it did not show any
suppressive effect, though, on the cox-2 mrna level. to investigate the suppressive mechanism of cox-2 protein, the
activating phosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase and  xxxg693xxx , which are important for translation, were measured. the
phosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase, not  xxxg693xxx , was increased by lps in a time-dependent manner, and was inhibited by
bst204 in a dose-dependent manner. the expression of cox-2 protein, however, was partially suppressed by rapamycin, an
upstream inhibitor of p70 s6 kinase. therefore, this paper suggests that the suppression of cox-2 protein by bst204 was
partially correlated with the inhibition of p70 s6 kinase activation.

prostaglandins have important roles in several
pathological processes—such as inflammation, thrombosis, and cancer—in addition to normal physiological processes. two isoforms of cyclooxygenases,

930

j.y. seo et al. / international immunopharmacology 5 (2005) 929–936

commonly called  xxxg1883xxx  (cox-1) and
 xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2), are responsible for the
biosynthesis of these lipid mediators. cox-1 is
constitutively expressed in most tissues, and seems
to be responsible for normal physiological functions
in gastric mucosa and renal blood flow [1]. in
contrast, cox-2 expression is minimal in most
normal tissues under basal conditions, but is dramatically induced by bacterial lps, cytokines, growth
factors, oncogenes, and carcinogens [2,3]. cox-2
activity and prostaglandin (pg)e2 levels were found
to be several folds higher in malignant tissues from
colorectal cancer, human gastritis, and breast tumors
[4–7]. since the targeted inhibition of cox-2 is a
promising approach to inhibiting inflammation and
carcinogenesis as well as to preventing cancer, various
chemopreventive strategies have focused on inhibitors
of cox-2 enzyme activity and expression [8–10]. the
molecular regulation of cox-2 gene expression is
normally tightly regulated on transcriptional and
translational levels. current work that investigates
the regulatory mechanisms of cox-2 expression has
demonstrated the central role played by post-transcriptional regulation. especially, rapid cox-2
mrna and translational inhibition is mediated
through a conserved au-rich element (are) present
within the 3v-untranslated region. the cox-2 are
exerts its control through association with are rnabinding proteins, such as hur protein, tristetraprolin,
auf1 (hnrnp d), and so on (reviewed in reference
[11]). furthermore, lim et al. demonstrated that cox2 expression is dependent on the activation of p70 s6
kinase in murine macrophages [12]. little is known,
however, as to whether crude ginseng extracts and
ginsenosides regulate the post-transcriptional process
or the translational activation.
ginseng, the root of  xxxd2200xxx  (araliaceae), is
one of the most widely used natural tonics in oriental
countries. its preparations have been taken orally as
health products or herbal medicines for a long time. it
has been believed that ginsenosides and their metabolites mainly have the pharmacological activities of
ginseng [13,14]. ginsenosides are a diverse group of
steroidal saponins showing the ability to target a vast
range of tissues. the two major structural groups of
ginsenosides are panaxadiols and panaxatriols. the
panaxadiol group includes rb1, rb2, rc, rd, rg3,
rh2, and rh3, and the panaxatriol group includes re,

rf, rg1, rg2, and rh1. among these ginsenosides,
rh2 and rg3 are currently sought after for their
bioactive properties. rh2 can reduce the proliferation
of various cultured cancer cells, and can influence
apoptosis [15–18]. rg3 has also been shown to
possess anti-tumor properties, and has an effect on
drug-resistant, cultured cancer cells [19,20].
in this paper, ginseng ethanol extract was treated
with ginsenoside-h-glucosidase to enrich rh2 and
rg3, after which its effects on the expression of cox2 and the mechanism of its action were investigated.
the expression of cox-2 protein and pge2 production were suppressed by bst204 in a dose-dependent
manner, and was partially correlated with the inhibition of p70 s6 kinase in lps-stimulated raw 264.7
macrophages.

2. materials and methods
2.1. reagents
these were purchased from the following sources:
cell culture reagents, from gibco/invitrogen (carlsbad, ca); tris–glycine polyacrylamide gels, from
novex (san diego, ca); tris–reagent, monoclonal
anti-h-actin antibody, and 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (mtt), from sigmaaldrich (st. luuis, mo); anti-cox-2 and anti-p70 s6
kinase, from santa cruz (santa cruz, ca); and antiphospho-p70 s6 kinase, anti- xxxg693xxx , and anti-phospho- xxxg693xxx , from cell signaling technology (beverly, ma).
2.2. preparation of fermented  xxxd2200xxx ,
bst204
fermented  xxxd2200xxx , bst204, was obtained
from biosapogen, (sungnam, korea), which prepared
the extract with its patented protocol. briefly, the
dried ginseng (0.5 kg) was extracted from 2.5 l of
ethanol and concentrated with a speedi-vac. then the
dry  xxxd2200xxx  was incubated with an enzyme
solution containing ginsenoside-h-glucosidase. after
enzyme reaction, the enzyme was removed by ultrafiltration (mwco, 10,000 d). the solution was
concentrated and treated with 50% acetic acid. the
concentrate was loaded into an hp20 column, which

j.y. seo et al. / international immunopharmacology 5 (2005) 929–936

was washed out with distilled water to get the neutral
ph of the flowthrough, and finally eluted with
ethanol. the dried eluate was designated as bst204
(fermented  xxxd2200xxx ). the bst204 contained
5% ginsenoside rh2 (c36h62o8 : 622.87), 10%
ginsenoside rg3 (c42h72o13 : 785.01), and other
ginseng constituents (table 1). the contents of rh2
and rg3 were very high compared with those of nondetectable rh2 and 2.8% rg3 in the crude ginseng
extract.
2.3. analysis of ginsenosides in the ginseng extracts
for the analysis of ginsenosides in ginseng
extracts, high performance liquid chromatography
was accomplished utilizing the capcell pack c18
ug 80 column (shiseido, japan) with a flow rate
adjusted to 1.0 ml per min. following sample
injection (usually 20 al), they were eluted under the
gradient condition of 10% to 60% acetonitile for 45
min and the eluate was monitored at 203 nm by an
ultraviolet detector. the amount of each ginsenoside
was determined directly from the peak area by usage
of a calibration curve.

medium (dmem) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(fbs), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin
sulfate (100 ag/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5%
co2. the cells were treated with bst204 or rapamycin 1 h before their treatment with 1-ag/ml lps for 4 h
or for the indicated times, washed with 1 pbs, and
then used for immunoblot analysis and rt-pcr.
2.5. mtt assay for cell viability
3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (mtt) is a pale yellow substance that is reduced
by living cells to yield a dark blue formazan product.
this process requires active mitochondria, and even
fresh dead cells do not reduce significant amounts of
mtt. the cells were cultured in 96-well flat-bottom
plates containing dmem with 10% fbs and were
incubated overnight. bst204 was added to a final
volume of 200 al medium/well. the cells were
incubated at 37 8c with a 50-al mtt solution (1
mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for 4 h. the
medium was removed by aspirations and the cells
were solubilized in dmso (100 al) for 10 min. the
optical density at 540 nm was determined using a
microplate reader.

2.7. rna preparation and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr)
the total rna was isolated with the use of a trizol
reagent (invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. one microgram of total rna was reversetranscribed using improm-iik reverse transcriptase
(promega) following the manufacturer’s manual
instructions. single-stranded cdna was then amplified
by pcr with specific primers of cox-2 and h-actin :
cox-2 sense, 5v-tgccccttcaatggttggta-3v;
cox-2 anti-sense, 5v-actggagggaccagccaaat-3v; h-actin sense, 5v-ggagaagatc tggcaccacacc-3v; and h-actin anti-sense, 5v-cctgcttgctgatccacatctgctgg-3. the following
pcr conditions were applied: 30 cycles of denaturation
at 94 8c for 30 s, annealing at 54 8c for 30 s, and
extension at 72 8c for 30 s.
2.8. determination of pge2 production
the cells were incubated with the fermented
 xxxd2200xxx , bst204 and/or lps (1 ag/ml). after
incubating the cells for 16 h, the culture medium was
collected and the concentration of pge2 secreted into
culture media was measured using a specific enzyme
immunoassay according to the manufacturer’s instruction (cayman, mi).

264.7 cells, and maximal in lps-treated cells, for 8 h
(fig. 1a). after this, it was decreased gradually (data
not shown). moreover, the expression of cox-2
mrna was at its peak 2 h after its treatment with lps
(fig. 1a). whereas cox-2 protein expression was
induced with crude  xxxd2200xxx  (ge), it was not
induced with bts204 (fig. 1b). these results
prompted an investigation on whether bst204 has
any inhibitory activity on cox-2 expression and
pge2 production. the inducible expression of cox-2
protein and pge2 production by lps was inhibited by
treating bst204 in a dose-dependent manner, but not
by treating crude  xxxd2200xxx  (fig. 2a and b).
3.2. effects of bst204 on cox-2 mrna expression
next, an investigation was conducted on whether
bst204 has any effect on the level of cox-2 mrna.
unexpectedly, the level of cox-2 mrna was not
diminished by bst204 (fig. 2c). this result suggested that bst204 did not have any effect on the
transcription pathway and the mrna stability of

2.9. statistical analysis
the data were presented as the meanfsem from
three or more separate experiments, as indicated in the
legend. the student’s t-test was done to perform a
statistical comparison between each stimulated group
and the non-stimulated control group with the use of
the sigmaplot 2000 (jandel scientific, corte madera,
ca). the asterisks indicate significant differences
from the control group (*pb0.05 and **pb0.001).

3.1. effects of bst204 on cox-2 expression

using western blotting analysis. the expression of

blot analysis, as described in materials and methods. (b) effects of

protein were detected by western blot analysis.

of cox-2 protein through translational inhibition was
then measured.
3.3. effects of bst204 on the activation of p70 s6
kinase
it is well established that p70 s6 kinase is
activated through multiple phosphorylations, and that
its activation is critical for translation [22,23]. p70
s6 kinase was time-dependently activated by lps,
and showed maximal activity after a 1-hour stimulation (fig. 3a). the activation was dose-depend-

levels of cox-2 protein were detected by western blot analysis. (b)
the pge2 production was dose-dependently inhibited by bst204,
not by crude  xxxd2200xxx  (ge). the cells were treated with

50 ag/ml) 1 h before they were incubated with 1-ag/ml lps for 16
h, and the levels of pge2 in media were detected using a specific
enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturerts instruction
(cayman co., mi). (c) the cells were treated with bst204 in the
indicated doses or with crude  xxxd2200xxx  (ge, 50 ag/ml) 1 h
before they were stimulated with 1-ag/ml lps for 4 h and the levels
of cox-2 mrna were measured by rt-pcr, as described in
materials and methods.

ently inhibited by bst204 (fig. 3b). consistent with
fig. 2a, crude  xxxd2200xxx  did not show any
effect on the activating phosphorylation of p70 s6
kinase (fig. 3b).
3.4. partial inhibition of the expression of cox-2 by
rapamycin
to confirm the above result, a measurement was
made of whether rapamycin, an upstream inhibitor of
p70 s6 kinase, suppressed the level of cox-2 protein
in lps-stimulated raw 264.7 cells. the expression
of cox-2 protein was partially suppressed in a dosedependent manner, and the activating phosphorylation
of p70 s6 kinase was completely inhibited by
rapamycin (data not shown). these results indicate
that the suppression of cox-2 by bst204 was
mediated by the mtor/p70 s6 kinase pathway and
other unknown pathways.

4. discussion
there is growing evidence that inhibitors of cox2 activity can be effective anti-inflammatory agents,
and are useful in the prevention and treatment of colon
cancer [15,24]. furthermore, agents that interfere with
the signaling mechanisms governing the expression of
cox-2 should inhibit inflammation and tumorigensis
[9,10]. ginsenosides are mainly responsible for the
pharmacological activities of ginseng, and recent
studies have shown that the ginsenosides rh2 and
rg3 have anti-tumor effects [25–28]. there have been
few reports, however, about the mechanism of action
of ginsenosides with respect to their anti-tumor effects
[17]. this paper investigates whether bst204, a
fermented  xxxd2200xxx  that enriches rh2 and
rg3, could also inhibit the expression of the
inflammatory enzyme cox-2 and pge2 production,
in lps-stimulated macrophages, and what the mechanism of its action is.
unlike crude ginseng extracts and lps, bst204
did not induce the expression of cox-2 protein (fig.
1b). this result led to a measurement of whether
bst204 inhibited cox-2 expression and pge2
production in lps-stimulated cells. as shown in
fig. 2a and b, bst204 dose-dependently suppressed
the expression of cox-2 protein and pge2 produc-

tion. it appears very likely that some components of
bst204, probably rh2 and rg3, were responsible for
the inhibition of the expression of cox-2 protein and
pge2 production. next, the mechanism of cox-2
expression inhibition was investigated, with the
hypothesis that bst204 suppresses the nfnb pathway, as with 20(s)-protopanaxatriol and other agents
[29–31]. very interestingly, the hypothesis was
wrong. the expression of cox-2 mrna did not
change with bst204 in either unstimulated (data not
shown) or lps-stimulated macrophages (fig. 2c).
unlike in the case of 20(s)-protopanaxatriol and other
reports, this result indicates that bst204 did not have
any effect on mrna expression and the stability of
mrna for cox-2. it was therefore interesting to
investigate whether bst204 suppressed lps-stimulated translation in the cells. a measurement was
made of whether lps activated two major signaling
pathways for translation, p70 s6 kinase and  xxxg693xxx .
lps time-dependently increased the activating phosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase (fig. 3a). the phosphorylation level of  xxxg693xxx , however, was already
high in unstimulated raw 264.7 cells, and was rarely
increased by lps in the cells (data not shown).
bst204, not crude  xxxd2200xxx , dose-dependently
inhibited the activation of p70 s6 kinase (fig. 3b).
recently, lim et al. reported that the activation of p70
s6 kinase induced the expression of cox-2 [12]. the
result of the investigation described in this paper, and
that of lim’s investigation, strongly suggest that the
inhibition of translation through p70 s6 kinase in
raw 264.7 cells mediated the inhibition of cox-2
protein expression. next, it was investigated whether
rapamycin, an inhibitor of mtor, which is an
upstream of p70 s6 kinase and  xxxg693xxx , suppressed
the expression of cox-2 in lps-stimulated cells.
consistent with the above result and the previous
report [12], rapamycin inhibited cox-2 protein
expression. this result strongly suggests that
bst204’s inhibition of cox-2 protein expression
was closely associated with the inhibition of the
activation of p70 s6 kinase. the expression, though,
was not completely blocked (fig. 4). therefore, the
possibility cannot be discounted that other mechanisms, such as the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway, are
involved in the activity of bst204.
at present, it is very difficult to chemically
synthesize rh2 and rg3 so as to develop them into

paper investigated whether a fermented ginseng
extract, bst204, could regulate the expression of
cox-2 and pge2 production in murine macrophage
cell lines, raw 264.7, that have been stimulated with
lps. it was found that bst204 inhibited the
expression of cox-2 in an nfnb-independent
manner. this was partially correlated with the
inhibition of p70 s6 kinase for translation. taken
together, this paper suggests that it may be possible to
develop bst204 as a useful agent for the chemoprevention of cancer or inflammatory diseases.
fig. 4. effects of rapamycin on the expression of cox-2 protein in
raw 264.7 macrophages. the cells were treated with rapamycin in

lps for 4 h, and the levels of cox-2 protein and the
phosphorylation of p70 s6 kinase were detected by western blot

a therapeutic medicine. therefore, an attempt was
made to enrich rh2 and rg3 in crude  xxxd2200xxx 
by treating them with ginsenoside-h-glucosidase.
finally, bst204 was derived, containing 5% rh2
and 10% rg3 (see materials and methods). the effect
of bst204 on the expression of cox-2 was
compared with that of the single ginsenoside rh2 or
rg3 at the same dose. unexpectedly, bst204 showed
a more potent inhibitory activity on cox-2 expression compared with rh2 or rg3 (data not shown). it is
plausible that bst204 seems to have the additive
activity because it contains other minor ginsenosides.
recently, the inhibitory effect of one of the ginsenoside methabolites, protopanaxatriol, on cox-2
expression was reported to suppress the expression
of cox-2 mrna [29], which was different from that
of bst204. while bst204 suppressed cox-2
protein without any effect on the level of cox-2
mrna (fig. 2c), protopanaxatriol inhibited the level
of cox-2 mrna by inhibiting the nfnb pathway
[29]. therefore, the additive effect of bst204 on the
expression of cox-2 did not seem to have been
derived from protopanaxatriol.
in summary,  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) is upregulated in response to inflammatory and pro-inflammatory mediators, and pge2 can influence many
aspects of the inflammatory cascade. abnormally
excessive pge2 production has been associated with
the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases and certain
types of human cancers, including breast cancers. this
