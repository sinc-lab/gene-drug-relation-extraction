abstract
purpose induction of cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4, an
enzyme that is involved in the biotransformation of more
than 50% of all drugs, by xenobiotics is an important cause
of pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions in oncology. in
addition to rifampicin and  xxxd2307xxx , the anticancer drug
paclitaxel has also been shown to be an inducer of cyp3a4
via activation of the  xxxg1598xxx  ( xxxg1598xxx ). we therefore screened 18 widely used anticancer drugs for their
ability to activate  xxxg1598xxx -mediated cyp3a4 induction.
methods a cyp3a4 reporter gene assay was employed
to identify  xxxg1598xxx  agonists among the eighteen anticancer
drugs. subsequently cyp3a4 mrna and protein expression following treatment with these  xxxg1598xxx  agonists was
assessed. finally, the evect of pre-treatment with these
agents on the 1’-hydroxylation of midazolam (a speciwc
cyp3a4 probe) was determined.
results paclitaxel,  xxxd2029xxx , tamoxifen, ifosfamide,
xutamide and docetaxel are able to activate  xxxg1598xxx , while

the treatment of cancer often constitutes a combination of
multiple anticancer drugs or hormonal agents, supplemented with a wide range of symptomatic therapies to treat
or prevent regimen-related side evects. the risk of drug–
drug interactions, however, increases with the number of
concomitantly administered medication [1]. a signiwcant

part of these drug–drug interactions are pharmacokinetic
interactions [2, 3]. due to the narrow therapeutic index and
steep dose–toxicity curves of chemotherapeutic agents,
small changes in the pharmacokinetic prowle can signiwcantly alter the toxicity and therapeutic eycacy of these
agents.
alterations in the pharmacokinetic prowle of anticancer
drugs often involve inhibition or induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes or drug transporters. one of the most
important drug-metabolizing enzymes is cytochrome
p450 (cyp) 3a4, which represents approximately 30% of
total hepatic, and up to 70% of total intestinal cyp content. human cyp3a4 has a wide substrate speciwcity and
is involved in the biotransformation of more than 50% of
all clinically used drugs [4], including several antineoplastic agents. the expression of cyp3a4 is highly
inducible and concomitant administration of cyp3a4
inducers, like phenobarbital or rifampicin, limits the oral
bioavailability of drugs that are substrate for this enzyme,
possibly resulting in sub therapeutic dosing or therapeutic
failure. in addition, enhanced anticancer pro-drug activation, due to induction, might increase morbidity and mortality as a result of increased blood levels of cytotoxic
metabolites.
cyp3a4 expression is transcriptionally regulated by
members of the nr1i nuclear receptor subfamily of ligandactivated transcription factors, which constitutes the human
 xxxg1598xxx  (hpxr;  xxxg1598xxx ) [3, 5, 6], the vitamin
 xxxg657xxx  (vdr;  xxxg2412xxx ) [7] and the  xxxg1599xxx  (car; nri3) [8, 9]. only a few agonists are
known for car and vdr, while  xxxg1598xxx  is activated by a
wide variety of structurally unrelated compounds that
include rifampicin, phenobarbital and  xxxd2307xxx , but also
anticancer drugs like paclitaxel [10] and tamoxifen [11].
upon agonist binding, the nuclear receptors heterodimerize
to the retinoid x receptor  ( xxxg1998xxx ) and bind to distinct
motifs within the promoter area of cyp3a4 [12]. nuclear
receptor activation is therefore one of the major mechanisms behind drug–drug interactions due to induction of
cyp3a4.
we hypothesize that also other anticancer drugs induce
cyp3a4 by activation of the nuclear receptor  xxxg1598xxx . to
evaluate the potential of anticancer drugs to cause or
reduce pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions by direct
binding to nuclear receptors, we examined 18 widely used
anticancer drugs for their capacity to modulate nuclear
receptor mediated cyp3a4 expression in a cell-based
cyp3a4 reporter gene assay [12]. in addition, also evects
on cyp3a4 mrna and protein expression were studied,
as well as midazolam 1’-hydroxylation to determine
cyp3a4 activity after exposure to these anticancer
agents.

cyp3a4 reporter gene assay
ls180 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 £ 104 cells/
well) in 200 l rpmi 1640++ medium and incubated overnight in 5% co2-humidiwed, 37°c atmosphere. following
incubation, the cells were transfected with 75 ng/well of
nuclear receptor expression vector (pcdg-hpxr), 210 ng/
well of the cyp3a4 luciferase reporter construct (pgl3cyp3a4-xrem), and 15 ng/well of the renilla luciferase
expression control vector (prl-tk), using 0.99 l/well
exgen500 in vitro transfection reagent (fermentas, st
leon-rot, germany) in 150 mm nacl. after overnight
transfection the medium was removed and cells were
washed with pbs. test compounds, diluted in dmso,
were added to the plates and serially diluted in culture
medium. rifampicin (10 m) was used as a positive control in the  xxxg1598xxx -reporter gene assay, respectively. the wnal
solvent concentration did not exceed 0.1%. after 48 h, the
medium was removed, cells were washed with pbs, and
lysed with 20 l/well passive lysis buver (promega, madison, wi, usa) for 15 min on a shaker. the cell-lysates
(5 l) were transferred to a white 96-well half area plate
(corning, corning, ny, usa) and the reporter activities of
wrexy luciferase and renilla luciferase were determined
using the dual-luciferase® reporter (dlr™) assay system according to the manufacturer’s manual, with reagent
volumes adjusted to the cell-lysate volume (promega, madison, wi, usa). luminescence was recorded on a mithras
lb940 microplate reader (berthold technologies, bad
wildbad, germany). the fold induction was calculated by
normalization of the wrexy-luciferase signal to the renillaluciferase signal.
induction studies
ls180 cells were plated at a density of 1 £ 10 6 cells/
well in 6-well plates in 2 ml rpmi 1640++. after reaching
80–90% conxuency, medium was replaced with medium
containing the diverent anticancer drugs cisplatin (20 m),
carboplatin (20 m), cyclophosphamide (300 m), ifosfamide (300 m), docetaxel (20 m), paclitaxel (20 m),
xutamide (20 m), tamoxifen (20 m),  xxxd2029xxx  (10 m)
and rifampicin (10 m; positive control) and dmso
(0.1%; negative control). the concentrations chosen correspond with peak plasma concentrations of the anticancer
drugs in standard anticancer regimens, while for ifosfamide
and cyclophosphamide a peak plasma concentration that is
reached in high-dose regimens was chosen. the cells were
treated for two consecutive days with the drugs and the
controls. at the end of each treatment period, the medium
was removed and the cells were washed with pbs.
after the washing, the cells were used to determine the
fold increase of cyp3a4 mrna by using qpcr. protein

37

expression levels were determined with western blotting,
and midazolam 1’-hydroxylation was used to determine the
cyp3a4 activity in these drug treated cells.
rna extraction and rt-pcr
total rna was extracted using the geneelute mammalian
total rna miniprep kit (sigma-aldrich, zwijndrecht, the
netherlands). rna integrity and quantity were determined
using a nanodrop diode array spectrophotometer (isogen
life science, ijsselstein, the netherlands). next, 1 g of
total rna was reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer guidelines using a random hexamer primer
(revertaid™ first strand cdna synthesis kit, fermentas,
st leon-rot, germany).
quantitative rt-pcr
the cyp3a4 and housekeeping gene (18s) mrna expression levels were analyzed using an abi prism 7700
sequence detection system (applied biosystems, foster
city, ca, usa). all reactions were singleplexed with the
housekeeping gene (18s). oligonucleotide primers and a
taqman probe for cyp3a4 were as follows: forward, 5⬘-t
caataacagtctttccattcctcat-3⬘; reverse, 5⬘-c
ttcgaggcgactttctttca-3⬘; and probe, 5⬘-tgtt
tccaagagaagttacaaa-3⬘. the primers and probe
used for 18s real-time pcr were a commercially available
assay on demand (applied biosystems, foster city, ca,
usa). according to manufacturer guidelines, data were
expressed as threshold cycle value (ct) values and used to
determine dct values. fold changes in expression were
calculated according to the transformation: fold increase =
2¡(diverence in dct).
western immunoblot analysis
the cells that were treated with the diverent anticancer
drugs were lysed in 250 l pbs containing 1% triton x100, 0.1% sds, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% (w/v) complete protease inhibitor cocktail tablet edta-free (roche,
basal, switzerland). protein concentrations were determined by a pierce bca protein assay (pierce, rockford,
il, usa) and 25 g of total protein was separated by sdspolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10%). proteins were
electroblotted onto immobilon p membranes (millipore,
bedford, ma, usa). after overnight blocking in 3%
bovine  xxxg124xxx , the membranes were incubated with
a murine monoclonal anti-human  xxxg590xxx  primary antibody
(1:500; gentest, becton dickinson, woburn, ma, usa) or
-actin (1:10000; ac-15; abcam, cambridge, uk) followed by incubation with a bovine anti-mouse igg coupled
to horse radish peroxidase (hrp) secondary antibody

(1:1000; santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca,
usa). the proteins were visualized by a chemiluminescence-based detection reagent (west femto; pierce biosciences) and the intensities of the cyp3a4 bands were
determined on a chemidoc xrs imaging system and
analyzed with quantity one analysis software (bio-rad,
hercules, ca, usa).

cell viability

cell-based cyp3a4 activity assessment

one-way anova with bonferroni and dunnett post hoc
testing was performed for statistical comparison of the
obtained cyp3a4 reporter gene and activity results and
considered statistically signiwcant when p < 0.05. statistical analysis on real-time pcr data were performed on
mean dct values (and not fold changes) to exclude potential
bias attributable to averaging data that had been transformed through the equation 2¡ct [13]. all statistical calculations were done in spss (v14, spss inc., chicago, il,
usa).

the cells that were treated with the diverent anticancer
drugs were incubated with 4 g/ml midazolam (mdz) in
phenolred-free rpmi without fbs and penicillin/streptomycin for 3 h. after the incubation period, the medium was
aliquoted and centrifuged for 5 min  xxxd1891xxx ,000£g. the
supernatant was further analyzed using hplc-uv.
hplc-uv analysis
the hplc-uv analysis was performed on a symmetry
c18 column (150 mm £ 3 mm; 3.5 m; waters, milford,
ma, usa) protected with a metagaurd c18-a guard column (2.0 mm polaris 3 m; varian, palo alto, ca, usa).
both columns were maintained at 40°c. the mobile phase
consisted of 75:25 (v/v) water/acetonitrile (containing
4.35 mm perchloric acid; ph = 2.4). the xow rate was
0.5 ml/min. the hplc system comprised a lc-10at
pump (shimadzu, kyoto, japan), a sil-10ad autoinjector
(shimadzu, kyoto, japan), and a scl-10a system controller (shimadzu, kyoto, japan). midazolam and its metabolite 1’-hydroxymidazolam were detected with a spd-m10
diode array detector (220 nm; shimadzu, kyoto, japan).
the precision was evaluated by repeatability and intermediate precision; both were <15%.
fluorometric enzyme activity assay
incubations were conducted in black 96-well microtiter
plates based on the method described on the gentest
corporation website (www.gentest.com). each well contained recombinant human cyp3a4 protein (supersomes;
1 nm), 1 mm nadph, 10 m of the test compound and
diverent concentrations that varied between 50 m and
50 nm of the non-xuorescent cyp3a4 probe bfc, in
200 l 100 mm potassium phosphate (ph 7.4) supplemented with 3.3 mm  xxxd2532xxx . the wnal concentration of dmso, which was the solvent for both the
test compounds and the bfc, did not exceed 0.1%. the
reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°c for 20 min.
formation of the highly xuorescent metabolite of bfc
7-hydroxy-4-trixuoromethylcoumarin (hfc) was measured
on a mithras lb940 microplate reader berthold technologies, bad wildbad, germany).

cell viability was determined based on the quantization of
intracellular atp with celltiter-glo® (promega, madison, wi, usa) according to the manufacturer’s manual.

docetaxel, vinblastine, vincristine, xutamide, tamoxifen

nuclear receptor mediated cyp3a4 induction was determined in ls180 cells that were co-transfected with the
hpxr expression plasmids and a cyp3a4 reporter construct. as shown in fig. 1, paclitaxel is a strong activator
of  xxxg1598xxx -mediated cyp3a4 reporter gene activity, while
xutamide,  xxxd2029xxx , cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, tamoxifen and docetaxel only moderately activate  xxxg1598xxx -mediated
cyp3a4 reporter gene activity. in addition, no increase in
reporter gene activity was observed in the absence of the
nuclear receptor expression plasmids indicating that the
increase in cyp3a4 reporter activity is mediated by  xxxg1598xxx 
(results not shown).
cyp3a4 mrna expression
mrna was isolated from ls180 cells that were exposed
for 48 h to rifampicin (10 m; positive control),  xxxd2029xxx 
(10 m), paclitaxel (20 m), and xutamide (20 m)
strongly induced cyp3a4 mrna expression, while ifosfamide (300 m), docetaxel (20 m), tamoxifen (20 m),
cyclophosphamide (300 m) and carboplatin (20 m) by
using quantitative rt-qpcr analysis. the concentrations
that were used were not cytotoxic as was determined by a

the cyp3a4 mrna levels were determined after 2 £ 24 h treatment
of the cells with one concentration of the anticancer drugs; cyclophosphamide (300 m), docetaxel (20 m), xutamide (20 m), ifosfamide
(300 m), tamoxifen (20 m),  xxxd2029xxx  (10 m) and paclitaxel
(20 m). rifampicin (10 m) was used as a positive control. for each
anticancer drug, three wells of cells were grown. cdna from each well
was assessed at least in triplicate using singleplexed quantitative taqman real-time pcr with 18s as housekeeping gene [signiwcance
(*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001) compared to the vehicle 0.1%

rifampicin,  xxxd2029xxx , paclitaxel and xutamide strongly
induced cyp3a4 mrna expression, while ifosfamide,
docetaxel, tamoxifen and cyclophosphamide only moderately induced cyp3a4 mrna expression compared to the
control. carboplatin did not alter cyp3a4 mrna expression, as was expected based on the results from the
cyp3a4 reporter gene assay.

cyp3a4 protein levels were evaluated using western
immunoblotting and densitometric analysis, and plotted as
fold induction. as shown in fig. 3, treatment of the ls180
with rifampicin (20 m) and paclitaxel (20 m) resulted in
signiwcantly induced cyp3a4 protein levels, while  xxxd2029xxx , ifosfamide, docetaxel, xutamide and cyclophosphamide and tamoxifen did not signiwcantly induced cyp3a4
protein levels.
cell-based cyp3a4 activity assessment
to evaluate the clinical relevance of the observations that
certain anticancer drugs are able to induce cyp3a4
reporter gene activity, and mrna and protein expression
levels, the metabolic activity of cyp3a4 was determined
after treatment of ls180 cells with these agents. the metabolic activity of cyp3a4 was assessed by measuring the
formation of 1’-hydroxymidazolam after a 3-h incubation
of the cells with the cyp3a4 probe-substrate midazolam.
as expected, based on the cyp3a4 protein expression
levels, both rifampicin and paclitaxel enhanced the
biotransformation of midazolam to the inactive 1’-hydroxymidazolam metabolite (fig. 4).  xxxd2143xxx  caused a
twofold increase in 1’-hydroxymidazolam formation, while
 xxxd2029xxx  was shown to decrease the formation of the
1’-hydroxy metabolite. all other compounds did not

evect of  xxxd2029xxx  and xutamide on the activity
of recombinant human cyp3a4 enzyme
since both xutamide and  xxxd2029xxx  were shown to act diverently on cyp3a4 activity as was expected based on the
cyp3a4 reporter activity and mrna and protein expression levels, the evect of both compounds on the enzyme
kinetics of cyp3a4 was further evaluated using recombi-

eighteen anticancer drugs were screened for their ability to
modulate cyp3a4 expression and activity. these oncolytic
agents were chosen to cover a broad range of mechanisms,
and consisted of topoisomerase i inhibitors, microtubulestabilizing agents, antimetabolites, antitumor antibiotics,
alkylating agents, and protein  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors,
antiestrogens and an antiandrogen.
a cyp3a4 reporter gene assay was used to rapidly
assess the potential of these 18 agents to induce cyp3a4.
the screening was performed in the intestinal cell line
ls180, because previous comparison of the cyp3a4
inducibility in both ls180 and other widely used cell lines
such as caco-2 [14] and hepg2 [15] had revealed that
ls180 cells represent a better model to study cyp3a4
induction.
 xxxg1598xxx  was shown to be involved in the
induction of cyp3a4 by 7 of the 18 anticancer drugs
(fig. 1). a highly signiwcant (p < 0.001) induction level of
 xxxg1598xxx -mediated cyp3a4 expression was observed for paclitaxel, while docetaxel, xutamide, ifosfamide, cyclophosphamide,  xxxd2029xxx  and tamoxifen moderately increased
cyp3a4 expression compared to rifampicin, a prototypical
cyp3a4 inducer. cisplatin, carboplatin, doxorubicin,

alter rate of substrate conversion compared to the dmso. these results

imatinib, etoposide and 5-xuorouracil all did not exert a
signiwcant evect on the  xxxg1598xxx -mediated induction of
cyp3a4.
since the nuclear receptor expression levels in the
cyp3a4 reporter gene assay described above are raised
artiwcially, the evect of treatment with the anticancer agents
on cyp3a4 mrna expression and protein levels in nontransfected ls180 cells was evaluated. the same compounds that increased cyp3a4 reporter activity were
shown to increase cyp3a4 mrna expression levels following 48 h incubation. interestingly, with the exception of
 xxxd2029xxx , the compounds (cyclophosphamide, tamoxifen,
docetaxel, ifosfamide, xutamide) that elicited a modest
cyp3a4 reporter gene activation also showed a moderate
induction of cyp3a4 mrna expression (<10-fold) and
protein expression (<1.5-fold) levels.  xxxd2029xxx , however,
highly induced cyp3a4 mrna expression levels (»18fold) in contrast to other compounds that were shown to
activate cyp3a4 induction. in the cyp3a4 reporter gene
assay and western blot assay,  xxxd2029xxx  was shown to only
moderately increase both cyp3a4 reporter gene activity
(<20-fold) as well as cyp3a4 protein expression levels
(<1.5-fold). the discrepancy between the cyp3a4 mrnaand the cyp3a4 protein expression levels is diycult to
explain. especially, because many diverent anticancer
drugs were used that all have diverent targets within the
cell by which these agents exert their cytotoxic evects.
we did show that eight anticancer drugs were able to activate  xxxg1598xxx -mediated cyp3a4 transcription of cyp3a4.
however,  xxxd2029xxx  caused an exceptionally high fold
increase in cyp3a4 mrna expression, which cannot be
explained by the activation of  xxxg1598xxx  by  xxxd2029xxx  alone.

possibly post-transcriptional processes such as rna stabilization are modulated by  xxxd2029xxx . however, this remains
to be explored.
the enzymatic activity of cyp3a4 after 48 h treatment
with the anticancer drugs was assessed by measuring
1’-hydroxylation of midazolam, which is solely catalyzed
by cyp3a4 [16]. it revealed that the 1’-hydroxylation of
midazolam was increased by exposure to the strong  xxxg1598xxx 
activators paclitaxel and rifampicin, while no signiwcant
increase could be measured after exposure to the weak  xxxg1598xxx 
activators tamoxifen, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide and
ifosfamide.  xxxd2029xxx  inhibited midazolam 1’-hydroxylation, which was conwrmed by a cyp3a4 inhibition study
with  xxxd2029xxx  on recombinant human cyp3a4 supersomes.
the increase in midazolam 1’-hydroxylation after treatment
with paclitaxel and rifampicin relates to the cyp3a4
protein expression levels after treatment with these agents.
in contrast to paclitaxel and rifampicin, the increase of
1’-hydroxymidazolam after pre-treatment with xutamide
did not correlate with cyp3a4 reporter gene, cyp3a4
mrna and cyp3a4 protein expression level data. these
data showed that xutamide only moderately induced
cyp3a4 compared to rifampicin, while xutamide caused
major increase in the cell-based cyp3a4 activity assay.
possibly xutamide (or a metabolite of xutamide) increases
1’-hydroxymidazolam formation by allosterically activating cyp3a4. a similar evect has been described for
-naphthoxavone [17]. however, the results from an
enzyme kinetics study with recombinant human cyp3a4
supersomes co-incubated with xutamide and bfc showed
that xutamide does not allosterically activate cyp3a4.
possibly a metabolite of xutamide causes the increase in the
cell-based assay, but this remains to be explored.
although the weak  xxxg1598xxx  activators do not signiwcantly
increase cyp3a4 protein levels and midazolam 1’-hydroxylation, these agents were shown to induce cyp3a4
reporter gene activity as well as mrna expression levels.
indeed, several of these agents (tamoxifen, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide) were shown to cause clinical relevant
drug–drug interaction as a result of cyp3a4 induction.
tamoxifen, for instance, reduced the plasma levels of concomitantly administered aromatase inhibitors letrozole and
anastrozole, by 37 and 27%, respectively, in a clinical trial
[18]. both aromatase inhibitors are cyp3a4 substrates.
tamoxifen was also shown to autoinduce its own clearance
as a result of cyp3a4 induction [11]. our study shows that
this autoinduction is most likely mediated by  xxxg1598xxx . in addition, the oxazophosphorines, cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide, are also known to autoinduce their clearance [19].
we found that ifosfamide (>100 m) causes  xxxg1598xxx -mediated
cyp3a4 induction. although this concentration seems very
high, it corresponds with the peak plasma concentration after
intravenous administration of >1.5 g m¡2 ifosfamide

123

(depending on the infusion schedule) [20, 21]. the ability
of ifosfamide to cause cyp3a4 induction at a clinically
relevant concentration of >100 m may, in part, provide an
insight into the mechanism by which ifosfamide is able to
autoinduce its own biotransformation [19]. however, also
other mechanisms like inhibition of enzyme degradation
should be taken into account [21]. remarkably, ifosfamide
had a greater capacity to induce cyp3a4 compared to
cyclophosphamide, which is an isomer of ifosfamide.
lindley et al. [22] showed that cyclophosphamide is able to
activate  xxxg1598xxx  at a concentration >100 m in vitro, which is
conwrmed by our results.
clinical proof for our observations that the other anticancer drugs, paclitaxel, docetaxel, xutamide and  xxxd2029xxx ,
have the potential to cause pharmacokinetic drug–drug
interaction is not yet known and should be further investigated. this especially is remarkable for paclitaxel, since
this compound has been identiwed as a strong activator of
 xxxg1598xxx  mediated cyp3a4 induction. however, many anticancer drugs are co-administered with other antineoplastic
agents and supportive care drugs (analgesics, antiemetics,
etc.). therefore it is diycult to identify the speciwc drugs
involved in the interaction. for instance, the taxanes, paclitaxel and docetaxel, are routinely co-administered with
dexamethasone, an agent used as anti-emetic and hypersensitivity prophylaxis and also a classic and potent cyp3a4
inducer [23]. in addition, non-responsiveness to chemotherapeutic agents is generally accepted as regimen related.
however, non-responsiveness could also be an evect of
enzyme induction, for instance due to concomitant unprescribed use of cyp3a4 inducers like  xxxd2307xxx , the active
component of st john’s wort [24].
in conclusion, we present the inductive capacity of a
range of widely used anticancer drugs on cyp3a4 expression and the mechanism by which these agents mediate this
response. paclitaxel [10], cyclophosphamide [22] and
tamoxifen [11] were already known to induce cyp3a4
expression via activation of  xxxg1598xxx  and our data conwrm
these results. however, in contrast to other studies [10, 25]
we observed a small, but signiwcant cyp3a4 reporter
activity after treatment with docetaxel.
we have identiwed three new  xxxg1598xxx  activating anticancer
drugs;  xxxd2029xxx , ifosfamide and xutamide, and have provided new insight into the autoinduction mechanism of
ifosfamide. both the cyp3a4 reporter gene assay and to a
lesser extent the cyp3a4 mrna determination are more
accurate in predicting possible clinical relevant drug–drug
interactions compared to western blotting and the midazolam 1’-hydroxylation assay. with the latter two assays only
strong  xxxg1598xxx  activators were shown to generate a response,
possibly due to detection limits, while the former two
assays allowed the identiwcation of weak  xxxg1598xxx  activators
that in the clinical setting are known to cause drug–drug

123

interactions as a result of cyp3a4 induction (e.g., cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and tamoxifen). the data on clinical anticancer drug–drug interactions are scarce, due to the
diyculty to recognize drug–drug interactions as such, and
the limited number of preclinical drug interaction studies.
clinicians should be aware of drug–drug interactions when
combining multiple (anticancer) drugs. especially (anticancer) drugs that activate  xxxg1598xxx -mediated cyp3a4 induction
have the potential to cause clinically relevant drug–drug
interactions by avecting the pharmacokinetic prowle of coadministered agents.
