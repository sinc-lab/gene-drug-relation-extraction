gilbert j. zoghbi, md,a,b and ami e. iskandrian, mda
selective adenosine receptor agonists have several advantages for use as stress agents in conjunction with myocardial perfusion imaging compared to the non selective agents such as
adenosine and  xxxd1914xxx . this review will summarize the pre-clinical and clinical data
on the selective adenosine agonist stress agents  xxxd3091xxx  (lexiscanò),  xxxd342xxx 
(corvuetm) and  xxxd194xxx  (stedivazetm) that have been studied so far with focus on  xxxd3091xxx  that has the most clinical data published so far. the article will review the adenosine
receptor types and properties. it will also review the various attributes of the selective adenosine agonists including their pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, their
coronary vasodilatory and hemodynamic effects, their safety and side effects, their interactions
with other drugs and their use with myocardial perfusion imaging. the landmark trials of the
selective adenosine agonists will be reviewed as well as their use in special patient populations
undergoing stress myocardial perfusion imaging.

introduction
pharmacologic stress is used in conjunction with
&50% of the &10 million myocardial perfusion imaging (mpi) studies performed yearly in the united states
for the evaluation of patients with known or suspected
coronary artery disease (cad). pharmacologic stress is
reserved for patients who cannot exercise, achieve
adequate exercise end-points, or have a left- bundle
branch block (lbbb) or electronically paced rhythms.
around 50% of outpatients and 75% of inpatients and
&30% of patients \75 years and &50% of c75 years
cannot perform adequate exercise mpi.1 the pharmacologic stress agents include the vasodilator agents and the
inotropic-chronotropic agents such as dobutamine or
 xxxd212xxx . the vasodilator stress agents are classified,
based on their action on the adenosine receptors, as nonselective agonists such as  xxxd1914xxx , adenosine, and

such as  xxxd3091xxx  (lexiscanò, gilead sciences inc),
 xxxd342xxx  (corvuetm, king pharmaceuticals) or
 xxxd194xxx  (stedivazetm, forest laboratories, inc).
 xxxd3091xxx , the only fda approved agent so far, has
become one of the more commonly used pharmacologic
stress agents in use in the united states accounting for
68% of the market compared to 15% for adenosine, 13%
for  xxxd1914xxx , and 4% for dobutamine.

vasodilator mpi
the vasodilator agents increase the myocardial
blood flow (mbf) by 3-5-fold in normal coronary
arteries independent of myocardial oxygen demand.
the generation of perfusion defects during vasodilator
mpi results from the disparity in mbf and radiotracer
concentration between territories supplied by non-diseased compared to diseased coronary arteries that have
limited ability to augment mbf. the capillaries and
myocardial blood volume are important in determining
the regional myocardial radiotracer concentration. cellular exchange and radiotracer extraction depend
primarily on capillaries that contain 90% of the myocardial blood volume.2 a capillary pressure of c30 mm hg
is needed to maintain resting mbf and homeostasis and is
achieved in the presence of coronary stenosis by recruitment of capillaries.2,3 in the presence of a significant

stenosis, the coronary mbf reserve and capillary recruitment are already maximal and can minimally increase
further under vasodilator stress leading to the disparity in
mbf and radiotracer concentration compared to a nondiseased coronary artery which is the basis for the
generation of perfusion defects by single photon emission
computed tomography (spect) mpi.

the adenosine receptors are ubiquitously located in
multiple tissue types and are divided into 4 subtypes:
a1, a2a, a2b, and a3 (table 1; figure 1).4,5 the a1
and a3 receptors activate a gi protein that decreases
adenylyl cyclase activity leading to a decrease in
intracellular  xxxd1773xxx  (camp)
which increases  xxxg1232xxx  conductance and
causes smooth muscle contraction.6-9 the a2a and a2b
receptors activate a gs protein that increases adenylyl
cyclase activity leading to an increase in intracellular
camp which opens potassium channels and inhibits the
voltage-gated calcium channels resulting in smooth
muscle relaxation and arteriolar vasodilation.7-9 stimulation of the a2a receptors causes coronary vasodilation
whereas stimulation of the other adenosine receptors
causes the undesirable side effects. an ideal adenosine
receptor agonist is one that causes vasodilation via
selective stimulation of the  xxxg82xxx  and minimal
or no stimulation of the other adenosine receptors that
cause the side effects (table 2). most of the adenosine
receptor agonists are derived from the purine nucleosides adenosine or xanthosine.9 the selective a2a
agonists that have been studied so far as pharmacological stressors for mpi are  xxxd194xxx  ( xxxd194xxx  or
 xxxd194xxx ),  xxxd3091xxx  ( xxxd3091xxx ), and  xxxd342xxx 
( xxxd342xxx  and  xxxd342xxx ).

or by the plasma  xxxg62xxx  permitting its
administration as an intravenous (iv) bolus rather than a
continuous iv infusion.11 in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses of  xxxd3091xxx  in healthy male
volunteers, adverse events were mainly related to vasodilation and increase in heart rate (hr) and were more
prevalent at  xxxd3091xxx  doses [3 lg/kg in a dosedependent effect.12 the maximum tolerated doses of
 xxxd3091xxx  were 20 lg/kg in the supine position and
10 lg/kg in the standing position.12 the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3091xxx  followed a 3-compartment model with
linear clearance and rapid distribution throughout the
body followed by a slower elimination half-life of
approximately 2 hours following iv bolus administration.12 following iv bolus administration,  xxxd3091xxx 
maximal venous plasma concentration was reached
within 1-3 minutes.11 the central compartment volume
of distribution was 11.5 l and the steady state volume of
distribution was 78.7 l with an estimated clearance of
37.8 l/h.12 renal excretion accounted for 58% of total
 xxxd3091xxx  elimination.12  xxxd3091xxx ’s volume of
distribution, terminal half life and excretion were dose
independent.11 the plasma  xxxd3091xxx  concentration
causing a 50% increase in emax (ec50) and the maximum
hr increase (emax) were12.3 ng/ml and 76 beats/minute, respectively.12 the elimination half life of a single iv

decreasing renal function.13 however,  xxxd3091xxx ’s
maximal plasma concentrations, severity and number of
adverse side effects did not differ significantly by
renal function.13 thus, dose adjustments of  xxxd3091xxx 
are not necessary in patients with impaired renal

the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd342xxx  were studied after
iv escalating doses (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and
6 lg/kg) that were infused over 10 minutes in healthy
volunteers.14  xxxd342xxx  exhibited linear pharmacokinetics and a dose-related increase in side effects such as
headache, nausea, vasodilation, and chest pain.14  xxxd342xxx  distributed into the extracellular space and
exhibited 2-compartment pharmacokinetics based on
visual inspection of the semi-log plots of plasma
concentration vs time curves.14 the distribution phase
was apparent at higher doses over the first 10 minutes
post-infusion and the terminal elimination phase was
generally apparent after 10-15 minutes post-infusion
with a terminal half life of 10 ± 4 minutes. systemic
clearance was independent of dose but correlated with
body weight.14 mean maximal plasma concentration
(cmax) values increased with dose with a range from
0.09-12.11 ng/ml. cmax occurred at the end of the
infusion with a corresponding mean time of maximum
plasma concentration (tmax) of 7.5-11.3 minutes across
all doses.14 the incidence of side effects was dose
related.14

 xxxd3091xxx  is marketed as lexiscanò (astellas
inc) and is packaged in 5 ml pre-filled syringes. it is
administered as a single 400 lg iv bolus dose over
10 seconds followed by a 5 ml saline flush.5 the
radiotracer is administered 20 seconds after the  xxxd3091xxx  bolus.5  xxxd342xxx  has not been yet approved
by the fda for use. it will be marketed as corvuetm
(king pharmaceuticals) and will be supplied in 250 lg
vials.  xxxd342xxx  is administered as a single weight
based iv bolus dose of 1.5 lg/kg over 30 seconds. the
packaging information for  xxxd194xxx  is not available.

the properties of the selective  xxxg82xxx  agonists are summarized in table 3. compared to
adenosine,  xxxd3091xxx  is 100 times more potent at
the  xxxg82xxx .7,10 in animal studies,  xxxd3091xxx 
had greater affinity and more selectivity for the a2a
receptor compared to the other adenosine receptors.16 in
one study of isolated rat hearts,  xxxd3091xxx  increased

affinity (ki) is defined as the ratio of the rate of drug
dissociation to the rate of drug association to the
receptor in question.16 thus, high affinity agonists have
a lower ki compared to low affinity agonists.16 the
affinity of  xxxd3091xxx  to the  xxxg82xxx  was [13fold compared to the a1a receptor.16 at the a2a
receptor,  xxxd3091xxx  (ki = 1200) has a lower affinity
compared to cgs-21680 (ki = 157) and  xxxd342xxx 
(ki = 21) and a higher affinity compared to adenosine
(ki = 2700-5600).16,17 in dog studies,  xxxd194xxx  was
equipotent to atl-193 as agonist of a2a receptors and
&6 and 35 times more potent than  xxxd342xxx  ( xxxd342xxx ) and cgs-21680, respectively.  xxxd194xxx  was
more selective for the a2a over the  xxxg81xxx .16
 xxxd194xxx  was 71 times more selective for the a2a over
the  xxxg81xxx  compared with selectivity ratios of 37
and 6 for  xxxd342xxx  and cgs-21680, respectively.16
 xxxd3091xxx  produced a maximal coronary vasodilator
response of similar magnitude compared with the higher
affinity a2a agonists (figure 3).16,17 thus a lower
affinity drug, such as  xxxd3091xxx , can elicit a potent
and rapid vasodilatory response due to the presence of a
high density of a2a receptors and a large spare receptor
capacity in the coronary arteries.16,17
animal studies
coronary vasodilatation
intravenous adenosine (13-267 lg/kg) and  xxxd3091xxx  (0.1-5 lg/kg) were compared in a study of conscious
dogs.18  xxxd3091xxx  caused a dose-dependent increase of
coronary blood flow (cbf) with a comparable maximal
increase to adenosine (221% ± 18% vs 227% ± 11%).18
 xxxd3091xxx  (ed50 = 0.34 ± 0.08 lg/kg) was more
potent than adenosine (ed50 = 51 ± 15 lg/kg, p \
.05).18 duration of cbf c 2-fold above the baseline
ranged from 97 ± 14 seconds to 247 ± 39 seconds for
the minimal to maximal  xxxd3091xxx  doses compared
to 24 ± 2 seconds after the maximal adenosine dose.18

figure 4. time course of changes in coronary blood flow
(cbf) by  xxxd3091xxx  ( xxxd3091xxx ) and adenosine (reproduced
from zhao et al19 with permission).

in another study of conscious dogs, iv  xxxd3091xxx  (0.12.5 lg/kg) or adenosine (10-250 lg/kg) caused similar
dose-dependent increases in cbf and dose-dependent
decreases in the late diastolic coronary resistance.19  xxxd3091xxx  at 2.5 lg/kg caused a similar increase in maximal
cbf compared to 250 lg/kg of adenosine though the
increase in cbf was significantly of longer duration
with  xxxd3091xxx  (figure 4).19 adenosine (ed50 = 47 ±
7.77 lg/kg) was 100 times less potent than  xxxd3091xxx 
(ed50 = 0.45 ± 0.07 lg/kg).19
 xxxd3091xxx  (2.5 lg/kg iv bolus) and adenosine
(4.5-minute infusion at 280 lg/kg) were studied in
anesthetized dogs.20 the biodistribution and clearance
of 201-tl and 99m-tc sestamibi tracers and the hyperemic responses were comparable between  xxxd3091xxx 
and adenosine.20 during  xxxd3091xxx  stress, the relative
microsphere flow deficit (0.34% ± 0.02%) was significantly greater than the relative perfusion defect with
201-tl (0.53% ± 0.02%, p \ .001) or 99m-tc sestamibi
(0.69% ± 0.03%, p \ .001) and the ex vivo single
photon emission computed tomography (spect) perfusion defect score was larger with 201-tl (22% ± 2.8%)
than with 99m-tc sestamibi (17% ± 1.7%).20
 xxxd342xxx  (0.1-3 lg/kg/minute infused for
10 minutes) produced dose-related vasodilatation in
the left anterior descending (lad) and left circumflex
(lcx) arteries of 5 dogs without altering mean bp,
hr, left atrial pressure, or left ventricular (lv) dp/
dt.21 infusion of adenosine at 300 lg/kg/minute for

caused lcx flow to increase approximately 3-fold
from rest, whereas flow in the stenotic lad did not
significantly change (figure 6). adenosine caused a
significant drop in mean systemic bp (figure 6).
 xxxd342xxx  (0.6 lg/kg/minute for 10 minutes) caused
lcx flow to increase 5-fold from rest, whereas flow in
the stenotic lad did not significantly change compared to rest with no associated hypotension
(figure 6).
 xxxd194xxx  ( xxxd194xxx ) was administered as a
continuous (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 lg/kg/minute
infused over 10 minutes compared to 250 lg/kg/minute
of adenosine for 3 minutes) or bolus (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and
1.5 lg/kg compared to 60, 250, 500, and 750 lg/kg of
adenosine boluses) infusions to normal dogs and to
dogs with critical lad stenosis.15 the 1.5 lg/kg dose
of  xxxd194xxx  caused an increase of cbf from 35.3 ml/
minute at baseline to 142.3 ml/minute.15 the 1.0 lg/
kg dose of  xxxd194xxx  produced a larger increase in
cbf than did the 500 lg/kg dose of adenosine.15  xxxd194xxx  bolus doses c0.5 lg/kg produced approximately
equal or greater increases in cbf as the adenosine
infusion (250 lg/kg/minute for 3 minutes) but without
provoking significant hypotension (figure 7).15 after a
bolus  xxxd194xxx  injection, cbf reached its peak in
2.3 minutes and remained elevated for several minutes
and returned to baseline within 20 minutes (figure 7).15
in dogs with critical lad stenosis, lad cbf remained
unchanged while normal zone lcx flow increased
&4-fold after the  xxxd194xxx  bolus resulting in a 4:1
flow disparity between the stenotic lad and normal
lcx zones.15

hemodynamic effects
iv  xxxd3091xxx  (0.1-2.5 lg/kg) in conscious dogs
caused a smaller decrease in total peripheral resistance
and a smaller increase in the lower body flow compared
to iv adenosine (10-250 lg/kg).19 adenosine caused
a dose-dependent renal vasoconstriction with a 683% ±
197% increase in renal vascular resistance and an
85% ± 4% decrease in renal blood flow with the
maximal adenosine dose while the maximal  xxxd3091xxx  dose did not significantly affect the renal vascular
resistance and caused a minimal decrease in renal blood
flow (-11% ± 4%).19 adenosine and  xxxd3091xxx 
caused comparable dose-dependent mesenteric vasodilation.19 the maximal  xxxd3091xxx  and adenosine doses
caused similar increases in the cardiac outputs.19 the
average peak cbf velocity increased by 3.3-fold,
whereas the peak peripheral flow velocity increased by
1.1-fold after administration of 1 lg/kg of iv  xxxd3091xxx  to anesthetized closed chest dogs.17 iv adenosine
doses of 134 and 267 lg/kg in conscious dogs increased
lv systolic pressure by 12% and 18%, respectively,

with no changes with  xxxd3091xxx  (0.1-5 lg/kg).18 the
lv dp/dt increased by 29% with adenosine and by
39% with  xxxd3091xxx .18 the mean bp decreased by
13 mm hg with  xxxd3091xxx  and by 18 mm hg with
adenosine.18  xxxd3091xxx  caused a lower decrease in
the systemic vascular resistance compared to adenosine
(-20% vs -45%), while both adenosine and  xxxd3091xxx  caused a 45% decrease in the mesenteric vascular
resistance.18
 xxxd3091xxx  caused a higher and a more prolonged
increase in hr compared to adenosine.18  xxxd3091xxx 
(0.3-50 lg/kg) caused a dose-dependent increase in hr
and a decrease in mean bp at the higher doses in rats.22
the bp decrease and the hr increase caused by
 xxxd3091xxx  were attenuated after pretreatment with
an  xxxg82xxx  antagonist whereas pretreatment with

metoprolol (1 mg/kg) attenuated the hr increase with
no effect on the hypotensive response.22 a ganglionic
blocker prevented the tachycardia-mediated effect of
 xxxd3091xxx  whereas the mean bp was further reduced.
the plasma norepinephrine levels increased by 2-fold
after 10 lg/kg of iv  xxxd3091xxx .22  xxxd3091xxx  (5
and 10 lg/kg) did not cause a significant change in hr
after administration of propranolol in dogs.23 this
dissociation of hr and bp responses suggests that
 xxxd3091xxx  baroreflex-mediated tachycardia maybe
more due to a direct stimulation of the sympathetic
nervous system via activation of a2a adenosine
receptors rather than an entirely baroreflex-mediated
response.22
 xxxd342xxx  (0.1-3 lg/kg/minute infused for 10
minutes) was compared to an infusion of adenosine at
300 lg/kg/minute for 4 minutes in 5 dogs.21  xxxd342xxx  did not produce significant systemic hypotension
(figure 8).21 the highest dose of  xxxd342xxx  decreased
the mean bp from 104 ± 6 to 88 ± 13 mm hg which
was not statistically significant.21 similar to adenosine,
there was a reflex rise in hr with  xxxd342xxx .
there was a trend toward a dose-related increase in
lv dp/dt.21
in dogs, mean bp fell significantly at the higher
doses of  xxxd194xxx  (13-18 mm hg) but was markedly
less than that produced by all of the adenosine doses
(&50 mm hg).15 the decrease in mean bp was transient and lasted 1.5-6 minutes after injection.  xxxd194xxx 
produced small but statistically significant increases in
heart rate and dp/dt at several doses, whereas adenosine
produced either no change or a decrease in heart rate at
the higher doses.15
effects of other drugs
pretreatment with 20 mg/kg of  xxxd150xxx  abolished the peak cbf and hemodynamic effects caused by
1 lg/kg of  xxxd3091xxx  and attenuated the effects of the
2.5 lg/kg dose in conscious dogs.18 the effects of
different doses of caffeine on 5 lg/kg of iv  xxxd3091xxx 
were studied in 16 conscious dogs. caffeine at 1, 2, 4,
and 10 mg/kg did not significantly affect the 2-fold
increase in cbf but decreased the duration of hyperemia
by 17% ± 4%, 48% ± 8%, 62% ± 5%, and 82% ± 5%,
respectively.24 caffeine at 4 and 10 mg/kg significantly
attenuated  xxxd3091xxx ’s effects on bp and hr.24

c85% of maximum peak flow velocity was 33 seconds
(range of 20-40 seconds) and was independent of
 xxxd3091xxx  dose.11 the peak flow velocity was reached
within 0.5-2.3 minutes with the 400 lg dose.11 the
mean duration of [2.5-fold increase of peak flow
velocity was 2.3 and 2.4 minutes for the 400 and
500 lg  xxxd3091xxx  doses, respectively (figure 10a).11
different doses of 3-minute iv infusions (0.3, 0.5,
or 1.0 lg/kg/min) and bolus injections (1.5 or 3.0 lg/kg)
of  xxxd342xxx  were studied in patients who underwent
diagnostic cardiac catheterization using a flow wire and
were compared to hyperemia induced by intracoronary
adenosine administration (figure 11).25 the 1.5 and

3 lg/kg doses whether infused over 3 minutes or
injected as boluses produced coronary hyperemia equivalent to that achieved by adenosine whereas the
hyperemia of the 0.3 lg/kg/minute dose was less.25
the hyperemic responses occurred within seconds of
administration. the 1.5 lg/kg dose produced near-maximal hyperemia by 4.5 ± 3.7 minutes that was sustained
for 7.4 ± 6.9 minutes, whereas the 3 lg/kg dose produced near-maximal hyperemia by 6.0 ± 3.8 minutes
that was sustained for 12.3 ± 9.6 minutes. the higher
dose also resulted in higher hr, rate-pressure product
and more subjective side effects. thus the 1.5 lg/kg
dose was selected as the pharmacological stress agent to
be used with mpi.25
in one study of human subjects that has been
published in abstract form, the effects of iv bolus doses
of  xxxd194xxx  (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 lg/kg) on cbf
(measured by a flow wire) and hemodynamics were
compared to a 140 lg/kg/minute adenosine infusion
over 6 minutes.26 all  xxxd194xxx  doses produced
hyperemia within 1 minute.26 the mean cbf velocity
remained [29 baseline values for 3, 6, 7, and 8 minutes
for the 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 2.5 lg/kg doses, respectively
(figure 12).26 the 1 lg/kg  xxxd194xxx  bolus dose
produced a cfr response that was similar in extent
and duration compared to an adenosine infusion.26

hr by 21 ± 21 beats/minute, decreased the systolic bp by
24 ± 15 mm and the diastolic bp by 12 ± 10 mm hg.11
the maximal bp changes occurred within 5 minutes of
 xxxd3091xxx  administration and returned to near baseline
within 15 minutes.11 in the phase ii and iii trials, iv
 xxxd3091xxx  boluses (400 and 500 lg) decreased the
systolic and diastolic bp and increased the hr (figure 13).27,28 in the larger phase iii trial,  xxxd3091xxx 
caused a greater increase in peak hr compared to
adenosine though the bp nadir was similar.28 the peak
hr was reached within 2 minutes and returned to nearbaseline within 30-40 minutes of  xxxd3091xxx  administration.28 in the 400 lg  xxxd3091xxx  group from the phase
ii trial, 5% of subjects had[25 mm hg decrease in sbp
and none had a drop in systolic bp to\90 mm hg.27 the
nadir systolic bp occurred at 3 minutes after  xxxd3091xxx 

administration.27 in one study, patients with dm, particularly those on insulin therapy, had blunting of the
adenosine- and  xxxd3091xxx -mediated increases in hr.29
a blunting in the hr response to adenosine and  xxxd3091xxx  was also seen in patients with the metabolic
syndrome.30 an increase in the number of features of the
metabolic syndrome was associated with a stepwise
decrease in the hr response (-0.92% per metabolic
syndrome criterion, p \ .05), irrespective of the presence
of dm. increasing blood sugar levels caused blunting of
the hr response even after controlling for dm and the
metabolic syndrome (0.60% ± 0.08% per 10 mg/dl,
p \ .001). the metabolic syndrome was independently
related to the hr response on top of dm, renal function,
left ventricular function, gender, age, baseline hr, bp,
and beta-blocker use.30 in summary,  xxxd3091xxx  causes
a faster and greater increase in hr and a comparable

from 75 ± 14 to 97 ± 15 bpm, and a decrease in sbp and
dbp from 133 ± 23 to 103 ± 20 mm hg and 72 ± 8 to
55 ± 10 mm hg, respectively.25 the 3.0 lg/kg dose
caused an increase in hr from 75 ± 15 to 108 ±
11 bpm, and a decrease in sbp and dbp from 126 ± 21
to 103 ± 17 mm hg and 74 ± 11 to 59 ± 10 mm hg,
respectively.25 the bp and hr returned to baseline levels
within 15 minutes.25 in the initial multicenter trial of
 xxxd342xxx  vs adenosine, there were no significant
differences between the 1.5 lg/kg  xxxd342xxx  dose and
adenosine in sbp and dbp drops compared to adenosine
(table 4).31 however, the 1.5 lg/kg  xxxd342xxx  dose
caused a higher increase in hr compared to adenosine.31
 xxxd194xxx  caused a dose-dependent decrease in
bp and increase in hr. the respective sbp and hr
changed by -8.6% ± 11.6% and 21.9% ± 15.5% with
the 1.0 lg/kg dose and by -14 ± 10.6% and 29.9 ±
18.5% with the 2.0 lg/kg dose.26

stress mpi
in the phase ii multicenter trial, 36 patients with
ischemia on adenosine (140 lg/kg/minute infusion over
6 minutes) 99m-tc sestamibi spect had  xxxd3091xxx 
(400 or 500 lg iv bolus) 99m-tc sestamibi spect
within 2-46 days from the adenosine study.27 the
agreement rates of the 400 and 500 lg  xxxd3091xxx 
doses for the visual presence of ischemia were 89% and
76%, respectively, compared with adenosine spect.27
the agreement rates between adenosine and  xxxd3091xxx  were 57% for the visual analysis and 69% for the
quantitative analysis.27 the 400 lg  xxxd3091xxx  dose
was subsequently adopted as the dose used in the phase
iii trial.
the phase iii (advance mpi 2 trial), multicenter, international, double-blinded trial studied 784
patients who underwent an initial qualifying adenosine
spect study followed by a 2:1 randomization to
 xxxd3091xxx  (400 lg rapid iv bolus) or adenosine
(140 lg/kg/minute infusion over 6 minutes) spect.28
the average agreement rate was 0.64 ± 0.04 for the
adenosine-adenosine spect images and 0.63 ± 0.03 for
the  xxxd3091xxx -adenosine spect images which were
above the pre-specified non-inferiority margin.28 the

studies.28 quantitative analysis from the advance
mpi 2 trial showed no differences between total and
ischemic perfusion defect extent and severity between
 xxxd3091xxx  and adenosine spect images (figure 14).33 linear regression analysis showed excellent
correlation between adenosine and  xxxd3091xxx  for
ischemic (r = 0.95, p \ .001) and total (r = 0.97,
p \ .001) perfusion spect defects.33 the agreement
rates of adenosine and  xxxd3091xxx  images were similar
within age, gender, bmi, and dm subgroups.34 the
image quality was similar within the subgroups for
adenosine and  xxxd3091xxx  except for men who had a
better image quality compared to women.34
in a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, 2-arm
crossover trial, 240 patients underwent 2 spect studies
in random order, one after stress with adenosine and one
with  xxxd342xxx , using iv boluses of 0.5, 1, or 1.5 lg/
kg over 30 seconds or a 0.5 lg/kg/minute infusion over
3 minutes.31 exact categorical agreement in the severity
and extent of ischemic defects between the different
 xxxd342xxx  doses and adenosine ranged from 79% to
87% with kappa values from 0.69 to 0.85.31 all doses
showed good general correlation though the 1.5 lg/kg
dose showed the closest correlation.31 the results of the
phase iii vision 302 trial of  xxxd342xxx  have been
published in abstract form. the study involved 2 doubleblind, double-dummy mpi procedures in random order
within 7 days. one was with a 1.5 lg/kg  xxxd342xxx 
bolus along with a 6-minute placebo infusion and one
with a placebo bolus along with 140 lg/kg/minute of
adenosine infused over 6 minutes. the study included
402 patients in the  xxxd342xxx  arm and 404 patients in
the adenosine arm. the mean paired summed difference
scores (sds) of  xxxd342xxx  vs adenosine images was
-0.09 (ci -0.44 to 0.27) was well within the prespecified 1.5 sds units for noninferiority. the concordance between the 2 stressors was 61% and complete
discordance was 3%.

safety and adverse effects
in the phase ii trial of  xxxd3091xxx , 72% of subjects
had mild and self-limiting side effects that resolved
spontaneously within 10 minutes.27 the 400 lg group
had a lower rate of side effects (61% vs 83% in the
500 lg group) and less pronounced hemodynamic
changes (figure 13).27 no subject had bronchospasm,
second or third degree av block, myocardial infarction
or death.27 in the phase iii trial,  xxxd3091xxx  was better
tolerated than adenosine and the summed symptom
score (chest pain, flushing and dyspnea) was significantly lower after  xxxd3091xxx  compared to
adenosine.28 the various side effects observed in the
phase iii trial are summarized in table 5. abdominal
pain with or without nausea or vomiting, diarrhea, fecal
incontinence, myalgias, musculoskeletal pain, tremor,
and hypersensitivity have been reported in the postmarketing experience. transient qtc prolongation has
also been reported shortly after  xxxd3091xxx  administration
though without any clinical significance.
the frequency of side effects was lower with
 xxxd342xxx  compared to adenosine in the initial multicenter trial (table 4).31 the severity of the symptoms
as assessed by visual analog scores for the intensity of
subjective adverse events was less with  xxxd342xxx .31
there were no av blocks or hypotension with  xxxd342xxx . there were no significant differences in systolic
and diastolic bp drops between the different  xxxd342xxx  doses and adenosine.31 in the phase iii trial, the
incidence of second or third degree av block was 0%
for  xxxd342xxx  and 3% for adenosine (p = .004).
compared to adenosine,  xxxd342xxx  had lower frequencies of flushing (50% vs 32%; p \ .05), chest pain

\.05

(61% vs 38%; p \ .05), and dyspnea (51% vs 42%;
p \ .05). patient-rated intensities of these events were
significantly lower during  xxxd342xxx  than adenosine
and more patients preferred  xxxd342xxx  over adenosine. changes in bp were comparable between the two
stressors though maximal changes in hr were higher
with  xxxd342xxx  compared to adenosine (25.3 vs
22.5 bpm, p \ .001).
despite the selectivity for the  xxxg82xxx , side
effects still occurred albeit they were briefer and less
severe though the more serious side effects such as
significant hypotension, av blocks, and bronchospasm
were not observed. the reason for the persistence of side
effects could be that the doses of  xxxd3091xxx  used in
clinical studies might be causing  xxxd3091xxx  to be less
selective for the  xxxg82xxx .4 the integrated
advance mpi trial assessed the effects of age,
gender, obesity, and dm on the safety of  xxxd3091xxx 
and adenosine mpi.34  xxxd3091xxx  was associated with
a lower incidence of chest pain, flushing, and throat,
neck, or jaw pain, a higher incidence of headache and
gastrointestinal discomfort and a lower combined symptom score in nearly all subgroups.34 women felt less
comfortable than men with both stress agents.34

 xxxd3091xxx  was studied in a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled crossover trial that enrolled 48
patients with mild to moderate asthma and a positive
 xxxd81xxx  challenge test.35 patients
were randomized to  xxxd3091xxx /placebo or placebo/
 xxxd3091xxx  in a 1:1 ratio where each patient received
400 lg of  xxxd3091xxx  and a matching placebo on 2
separate treatment days separated by a 1 to 14 days
washout period.35 all patients abstained from the use of
bronchodilators for at least 6 hours prior to the study.
there was no significant difference in the mean forced
expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1) at any time point
between  xxxd3091xxx  and placebo (figure 15a).35 the
mean ratio of the (fev1) at each tested time point
relative to the baseline fev1 was significantly higher
after treatment with  xxxd3091xxx  compared with placebo
from 10 to 60 minutes after treatment (figure 15b).35
bronchoconstrictive reactions ([15% reduction of
fev1 within 2 hours compared to baseline) occurred
in the moderate asthma group and were similar in the
 xxxd3091xxx  and placebo groups (4.3% vs 4.2%,
p = ns), were clinically silent and did not require any
therapy.35 dyspnea occurred in 34% of patients after

 xxxd3091xxx  and in none of the patients after placebo.
the occurrence of dyspnea was not associated with a
decrease in fev1 (figure 15c) and none of the patients
in either groups had \92% oxygen desaturation.35
in another randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, the safety of  xxxd3091xxx  was
evaluated in 49 patients with moderate to severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (copd).36 short-acting
bronchodilators were withheld for at least 8 hours before
treatment. there were no differences between  xxxd3091xxx  and placebo on repeated (measured at prespecified time intervals up to 2 hours post- xxxd3091xxx 
or placebo administration) follow up fev1, forced vital
capacity, respiratory rate, pulmonary examinations, and
oxygen saturation (figure 15d, e).36 the mean maximum decline in fev1 was 0.11 ± 0.02 l and
0.12 ± 0.02 l (p = .55) in the  xxxd3091xxx  and placebo
groups, respectively.36 new-onset wheezing was noted
in 6% and 12% of the  xxxd3091xxx  and placebo groups,
respectively (p = .33).36 bronchoconstricitve reactions
were clinically silent and occurred in 12.2% and 6.1% of
the  xxxd3091xxx  and placebo groups, respectively
(p = .31). dyspnea was reported in 61% of patients in

in a dose-escalating, single-blinded phase and a
placebo-controlled, double-blinded phase study,  xxxd342xxx  was administered to 87 adults with documented
mild, intermittent, asthma.37 in the single-blinded phase,
3 sequential cohorts of 8 subjects received intravenous
 xxxd342xxx  (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 lg/kg). in the doubleblinded phase, the subjects were randomly assigned to
either  xxxd342xxx  1.5 lg/kg (n = 41) or placebo
(n = 22).37 the most common adverse events were
tachycardia, dizziness, and flushing.  xxxd342xxx  was
well tolerated and caused no clinically significant
bronchoconstriction defined as decrease in fev1 of
c20% from baseline or significant changes in the
pulmonary function parameters (fev1, forced vital
capacity, pulse oximetry, and forced expiratory flow
during the middle 50% of the forced vital capacity).37

patients with renal disease
the safety of  xxxd3091xxx  that is renally excreted was
studied in 277 consecutive patients with end stage renal
disease (esrd) who underwent  xxxd3091xxx  spect for
clinical indications and were compared to a cohort of 134
patients with normal renal function.38 the patients with
esrd were younger than the controls. the esrd patients
had similar rates of abnormal myocardial perfusion imaging (19% vs 18% compared to controls, p = ns) and lower
left ventricular ejection fractions (57% ± 12% vs 64% ±
12% compared to controls, p \ .001). the changes in hr
and systolic bp from peak stress to baseline were 20 ± 12
beats/minute vs 22 ± 13 beats/minute and -11 ±
24 mm hg vs -12 ± 23 mm hg in the esrd and control
groups, respectively (p = ns for both). side effects were
reported in very few patients in either group during the
stress test and no patient had serious adverse events in
either group.38 thus,  xxxd3091xxx  was well tolerated in
patients with esrd.

patients with liver disease
in one study, 168 consecutive patients with end stage
liver disease (esld) who underwent  xxxd3091xxx  mpi
were compared to a control group of 168 patients from the
same time period with no liver disease and with comparable
mpi results.39 patients with esld were younger (58 ± 7 vs
62 ± 12 years, p = .0002).39 the mpi images were normal in 96% of patients in each group.39 the lvef was
higher in the esld group compared to the control group
(72% ± 10% vs 66% ± 11%, p = .0001). compared to
the control group, the esld group had a lower increase in
the hr in response to  xxxd3091xxx  (16 ± 11 vs 23 ±
16 bpm, p = .0001), but similar changes in sbp (-9 ± 12
vs -11 ± 14 mm hg) and dbp (-6 ± 8 vs -7 ±
10 mm hg) and similar incidence of  xxxd3091xxx  side
effects.39 there were no deaths or medication-related
adverse events that required hospitalization in either group
within 30 days index study.39

 xxxd3091xxx  in combination with exercise
mpi
 xxxd3091xxx  with low level exercise in patients
undergoing mpi was evaluated in a randomized, doubleblind, placebo, and active controlled study.40 patients
who underwent standard adenosine mpi for clinical
indications were randomized in a 2:1 manner to lowlevel exercise with bolus intravenous injection of  xxxd3091xxx  (n = 39) or placebo (n = 21).40 adverse
events occurred in 95%, 77%, and 33% of patients
receiving adenosine alone,  xxxd3091xxx  with exercise,
and placebo with exercise, respectively. peak hr was
13 bpm greater following  xxxd3091xxx  with exercise
compared to placebo exercise (p = .006).40 change in
mean sbp from baseline, change from baseline to nadir
sbp, and percentage of patients with a decline in sbp
by c20 mm hg were not significantly different between
 xxxd3091xxx  with exercise and placebo with exercise.40
the mean heart-to-liver and heart-to-gut ratios were
improved with  xxxd3091xxx  with exercise compared to
adenosine alone.40 compared to adenosine, 70% of
patients felt that  xxxd3091xxx  with exercise was better
based on a tolerability questionnaire.40 one drawback of
this study is that there was no  xxxd3091xxx  only arm for
comparison.
in another study, 1,263 patients underwent  xxxd3091xxx  stress mpi (596 with low-level exercise).41
 xxxd3091xxx  with exercise compared to  xxxd3091xxx 
alone was associated with significantly lower rates of
shortness of breath (23% vs 32%), dizziness (12% vs
19%), palpitations (6.7% vs 37%), and nausea (1.2% vs
3.3%).41 chest pain (33% vs 37%), headache (0.7% vs
2.1%), and transient av blocks (0.34% vs 0.15%) were

not significantly different between the  xxxd3091xxx  with
exercise and the  xxxd3091xxx  alone groups, respectively.41 the  xxxd3091xxx  with exercise group compared
to the  xxxd3091xxx  alone group had significantly more
frequent drop in sbp by [10 mm hg (56% vs 47%) and
[30 mm hg (12% vs 7%) and a higher peak hr
(104 ± 19 vs 91 ± 17 bpm).41 one drawback of the
study is that the same patients were not compared with
and without exercise.
summary
 xxxd3091xxx  was fda approved in april 2008. its
use as a stressor is gaining more acceptance and
adoption instead of adenosine or  xxxd1914xxx  given
its ease of administration and better tolerability. the
other  xxxg82xxx  agonists are still in various stages of
development. despite their selectivity to the a2a
receptor, side effects related to activation of the other
adenosine receptors continue to occur albeit at a lower
frequency and with less severity and duration compared
to the selective adenosine agonists. the search for the
ideal selective adenosine agonist is not over yet.
