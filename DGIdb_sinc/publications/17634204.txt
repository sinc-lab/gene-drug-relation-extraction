july 18, 2007; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00185.2007.—we studied the
roles of estrogen receptors (er) and aromatase in the mediation of
flow-induced dilation (fid) in isolated arteries of male er␣-knockout
(er␣-ko) and wild-type (wt) mice. fid was comparable between
gracilis arteries of wt and er␣-ko mice. in wt arteries, inhibition
of no and prostaglandins eliminated fid. in er␣-ko arteries,
n␻-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-name) inhibited fid by ⬃26%,
whereas indomethacin inhibited dilations by ⬃50%. the remaining
portion of the dilation was abolished by additional administration of
6-(2-proparglyoxyphenyl)hexanoic acid (ppoh) or iberiotoxin, inhibitors of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (eet) synthesis and large-conductance potassium channels, respectively. by using an electrophysiological technique, we found that, in the presence of 10 dyne/cm2 shear
stress, perfusate passing through donor vessels isolated from gracilis
muscle of er␣-ko mice subjected to l-name and indomethacin
elicited smooth muscle hyperpolarization and a dilator response of
endothelium-denuded detector vessels. these responses were prevented by the presence of iberiotoxin in detector or ppoh in donor
vessels. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis
indicated a significant increase in arterial production of eets in
er␣-ko compared with wt mice. western blot analysis showed a
significantly reduced endothelial  xxxd2738xxx  synthase expression but
enhanced expressions of aromatase and er␤ in er␣-ko arteries.
treatment of er␣-ko arteries with specific aromatase short-interfering rna for 72 h, knocked down the aromatase mrna and protein
associated with elimination of eet-mediation of fid. thus, fid in
male er␣-ko arteries is maintained via an endothelium-derived
hyperpolarizing factor/eet-mediated mechanism compensating for
reduced no mediation due, at least in part, to estrogen aromatized
from testosterone.

the presence of steroid hormone receptors in vasculature has
been recognized for some time (21) and the effect of
activation of vascular estrogen receptors (ers) on genomic
and nongenomic vascular responses in both sexes has been
amply investigated (6). a normal er function is required for
the cardiovascular development and function in both sexes
(17, 37).
recently, considerable attention has been directed to the
issue of how cardiovascular tissues in males respond to the
exposure of estrogen. a key enzyme responsible for conversion of androgen to estrogen in males is aromatase, a member

of the cytochrome p-450 (cyp) superfamily of enzymes. in
males, multiple tissues are involved in the aromatization of
testosterone to form estradiol, including the testes, liver, muscle, skin, and adipose tissue (1), as well as vascular smooth
muscle and endothelial cells (7, 30). increasing evidence has
been provided that estrogen has beneficial effects on the male
cardiovascular system of humans and animals (22). recent
studies highlight the significance of aromatase-derived estrogen in the regulation of endothelial function in the male
vasculature. a reduction of endogenous estrogen via aromatase
inhibition significantly decreases flow-induced dilation of brachial arteries in healthy young men (19). in male aromataseknockout (aromatase-ko) mice, which are incapable of synthesizing estrogen, acetylcholine-stimulated release of nitric
oxide (no) is significantly decreased compared with wild-type
(wt) controls (18). thus, aromatase has been defined as an
estrogen-producing enzyme in vasculature (7) and has been
shown to be essential for the maintenance of normal endothelial function in male vessels (33). estrogens generated in the
male vasculature initiate regulatory functions via activating
ers that are located in both smooth muscle and endothelial
cells (26, 34). the role of er␣ in the estrogen-dependent
potentiation of no synthesis has been well established (8, 29).
men lacking functional er␣ were reported to have early
coronary arterial calcification, as well as impairment of endothelial function (31, 32). specifically, the variation in the gene
for er␣, such as with the cc genotype at c.454-397cc or
c.454-397t⬎c was demonstrated to be associated with an
increased risk of myocardial infarction in men (28).
given that estrogen is necessary for the maintenance of
endothelial function in the male vasculature and that ers are
required for the mediation of vascular responses, it is legitimate to hypothesize that the release of no from vessels in
response to shear stress is reduced in er␣-ko mice. also, it
remains of interest to seek an answer to the question of whether
and by what mechanisms estrogen exerts a beneficial effect on
endothelial mechanotransduction to shear stress in the absence
of its specific receptor, a target which has been shown to be
necessary in estrogen-induced no production. thus, our studies were conducted on isolated and cannulated gracilis muscle
and mesenteric arteries of male er␣-ko and wt mice. shear
stress-induced arterial dilations and the mediators responsible
for the responses were assessed. the data obtained validate our
hypothesis that an attenuated no-mediated portion of flowinduced responses caused by er␣ deficiency is compensated
for by endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor(s) (edhf),

effects of estrogen in male arterial responses

identified as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (eets), which are metabolites of  xxxd208xxx  via cyp leading to a normal
vasodilator response to shear stress.
methods

er␣-ko and wt (c57bl/bnt) 12–14 wk-old male mice were
purchased from taconic farms. all protocols were approved by the
institutional animal care and use committee of new york medical
college and conform to the current national institutes of health and
american physiological society guidelines for the care and use of
laboratory animals.
isolated arteries
mice were killed by inhalation of 100% co2. experiments were
conducted on arteries isolated from either gracilis muscle or mesentery because of the identical features of their flow-induced dilations,
as well as the mediators responsible for the responses (10, 11, 13, 14,
36). the first-order gracilis muscle arteries were isolated for experiments of flow-induced dilation. in experiments of membrane potential
measurement, donor vessels were isolated from first-order gracilis
muscle arteries of er␣-ko and wt mice. second-order mesenteric
arteries of the corresponding animals were used as detector vessels.
the endothelium of the detector vessel was removed by injection of
air into the vessel lumen as described previously (10, 11). an rna
interference study was performed on second-order mesenteric arteries
of er␣-ko mice because they have adequate length with fewer
branches. also, a sufficient number of vessels can be obtained from
the mesentery for rt-pcr and western blot analysis after transfection with specific short-interfering rna (sirna).
flow/shear stress-induced dilation
changes in diameter of arteries in response to increases in perfusate
flow (from 0 to 10 ␮l/min in 2 ␮l/min steps) were studied at 80 mmhg
of perfusion pressure.
first, roles of no and prostaglandins (pgs) in flow-induced
dilation were assessed by exposure of vessels to n␻-nitro-larginine methyl ester (l-name; 3 ⫻ 10⫺4m) and indomethacin
(indo; 10⫺5m), inhibitors of no synthase (nos) and cyclooxygenase (cox), respectively, after control flow-diameter curves
were obtained.
second, the role of metabolites of cyp/epoxygenase in the mediation of the l-name/indo-resistant portion of flow-induced dilation was assessed by using 6-(2-proparglyoxyphenyl)hexanoic acid
(ppoh; 5 ⫻ 10⫺5m), an inhibitor of cyp/epoxygenase (10) responsible for metabolizing  xxxd208xxx  to eets.
finally, contribution of potassium channels to ppoh-sensitive
flow-induced dilations was evaluated by administration of iberiotoxin
(ibtx; 2 ⫻ 10⫺7m), a blocker of large-conductance ca2⫹-dependent
k⫹-channels (bkca).
assessment of smooth muscle membrane potential
of detector vessels
similar to what was described previously (11), the membrane
potential of an endothelium-denuded mesenteric artery (detector vessel) in response to the perfusate that had flowed through a 10
dyne/cm2-stimulated gracilis artery (donor vessel) was recorded.
briefly, a donor vessel was cannulated in chamber a and an endothelium-denuded detector vessel was cannulated in chamber b that was
connected serially by a micropipette (⬃2 ␮l volume) to the outflow
site of chamber a. thus, when shear stress was initiated by perfusion
of the donor vessel, the perfusate flowed through the detector vessel
in which changes in membrane potential and diameter were simultaneously recorded. intraluminal pressure of the two vessels was maintained at 80 mmhg. the membrane potential was recorded with an
electrometer (model ie-210; warner). tip resistance of the glass
ajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

electrode was ⬃40 –70 m⍀. the electrode was positioned via a
micromanipulator (narishige) and further advanced into a smooth
muscle cell of the vessel with an oil hydrostatic micromanipulator
(trentwells). the output of the electrometer and the video calipers
were connected to a data acquisition system (model di-700; dataq
instruments). a successful intracellular recording was confirmed by
the criteria described previously (11).
cyp/epoxygenase activity in skeletal muscle arteries
first-order gracilis muscle arteries including their distal branches
(⬃50 –70 ␮g protein/per sample) isolated from six wt and six
er␣-ko mice were incubated in the presence of nadph (10⫺3m),
indo (3 ⫻ 10⫺5m), l-name (10⫺4m),  xxxd208xxx  (3 ⫻
10⫺5m), and dibromododecynyl-methylsulfimide (3 ⫻ 10⫺5m), an
inhibitor of ␻-hydroxylase, at 37°c for 1 h.
purification of eets. a mixture of eet-d8 (8,9-, 11,12-, and
14,15-eet; 4.5 ng) was added to each sample as internal standards.
the samples were extracted twice and were purified by rp-hplc.
the fractions were evaporated to dryness and derivatized for gas
chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) analysis.
derivatization and mass spectrometric analyses. the method of
sample derivatization and quantification by negative chemical ionization gc/ms was similar to those described previously (10, 13). the
endogenous eets were identified (ion m/z 319) by comparison of gc
retention times with authentic d8-eets (m/z 327) standards and
quantitated by calculating the ratio of abundance.
rna interference study
vessel culture perfusion system. all perfusion chambers, tubing,
reservoirs, and connectors were autoclaved prior to use. the perfusion
system was placed in a vertical cell-culture hood (edgecard, sanford me) to maintain a sterile environment. the system consists of
four 1-ml perfusion chambers that provides an identical experimental
environment for four single vessels treated with different agents. the
intravascular pressure of the vessels was maintained by four separate
pressure reservoirs. the height of the reservoir was precisely controlled. intraluminal flow was generated by a linear syringe pump
coupled with an in-line pressure transducer to monitor the inflow
pressure. the outflow pressure (the height of the reservoir) was
adjusted accordingly to maintain intravascular pressure constant. the
flow rate was adjusted within the submicroliters-per-minute range.
the diameter of vessels was measured by a microscope television
image shearing system and recorded in a computer. the feasibility of
vessel culture systems has been proven by our previous studies (12),
and additionally, our preliminary studies further demonstrated constant flow-induced dilations and release of no in vessels that had been
incubated for 7 days.
rna interference study. the efficiency and specificity for sirna
transfection in isolated vessels have been proven by our preliminary
studies by using hs/mm- xxxg1366xxx  control (positive control) and nonsilencing control sirna labeled with alexa fluor 488 (negative
control). after transfection of  xxxg1366xxx  sirna (5 nm) for 6 h, arterial
 xxxg1366xxx  mrna was knocked down by ⬃70% and by ⬃80% after
48 h, whereas the gene expression in time course control vessels
(transfected with nonsilencing sirna for 48 h) was maintained. also,
a successful uptake of sirna by endothelial cells was confirmed by
transfection of vessels with alexa fluor 488-labeled sirna. the
rna interference human/mouse starter kit, as well as the primers, was
purchased from qiagen.
in the present study, four second-order mesenteric arteries isolated
from male er␣-ko mice were cannulated at 80 mmhg of intravascular pressure in perfusion chambers. the vessels were superfused
with dmem with 1% antibiotic antimycotic solution without serum.
after a 1-h equilibration period, shear stress (10 dyne/cm2)-induced
dilation was recorded at 80 mmhg perfusion pressure in the presence
of l-name (3 ⫻ 10⫺4m) and indo (10⫺5m). after that, two vessels

were transfected with aromatase sirna (mm_cyp19a1_1_hp
sirna; qiagen). the sirna was mixed initially with 3 ␮l hiperfect
transfection reagent (qiagen) per 100 ␮l dmem at room temperature
for 10 min. the mixture was further diluted 1:5 with dmem to a final
concentration of 25 nm sirna. the sirna mixture was then administered intra- and extraluminally to the cannulated vessels at 37°c for
4 h without flow. the other two vessels were incubated with transfection reagent without sirna for the same period of time. after that,
the vessels were washed with dmem and further incubated at 50
mmhg of intravascular pressure with a constant 2 ␮l/min perfusate
flow and in the presence of 5 ⫻ 10⫺10m testosterone for 72 h. shear
stress-induced dilation (in the presence of l-name and indo) was
then reassessed at 80 mmhg perfusion pressure. the time course
control vessels (incubated with transfection reagent without sirna),
which maintained dilations to shear stress, were then subjected to
ppoh or ibtx for 45 min followed by repeating the shear stressinduced responses. the vessels were collected at the end of experiments to determine aromatase mrna and protein by real time
rt-pcr and western blot analysis, respectively.
quantitative real-time rt-pcr
total rna of single vessels was purified using a mini-rna
isolation kit (zymo research, orange, ca). reverse transcription was
performed using 0.5 ␮g rna and superscript ii (invitrogen) as per
manufacturer’s instructions and was done in duplicate with 10% of the
rt product used for pcr amplification in the presence of sybr
green. increased fluorescence was determined in real time using a
stratagene mx3000p. aromatase primers were purchased from
qiagen (mm_cyp19a1_1_sg) and the expression of aromatase was
normalized to  xxxg861xxx .
western blot analysis
single vessels were homogenized in 1⫻ laemmli buffer for 1 min,
incubated in ice for 30 min, and sonicated twice in ice-cold water with
1 min each and a 5-min interval, and then boiled for 5 min. after a
brief centrifugation, samples were loaded on a 10% sds-page gel
and transferred to a pvdf membrane. membranes were probed with
primary antibodies of endothelial nos (enos; 1:1,000; bd transduction), er␤ (1:500, affinity bioreagent), or aromatase (1:1,000,
biovision) overnight at 4°c. secondary antibodies were conjugated
to horseradish peroxidase according to the amersham ecl-plus
protocol. the exposed film was developed in a kodak x-omat
developer. image acquisition and density of specific bands on the film
were obtained by an imaging system (alpha innotech). specific bands
from arterioles were normalized to  xxxg861xxx  or ␤-actin.
calculations and statistics
changes in diameter in responses to increases in flow in each vessel
were normalized to its passive diameter. statistical significance was
calculated by repeated-measures anova followed by tukey/kramer
multiple-comparison test. data are presented as means ⫾ se. the
number of mice is represented by n. a group t-test was also used in
comparison of two independent groups, such as data of gc/ms and

figure 1 demonstrates the changes in diameter of arteries of
er␣-ko and wt mice in response to step increases in flow in
the control condition (fig. 1a) and in the presence of different
inhibitors (fig. 1, b–d). in the control condition, the magnitude of flow-induced dilation was comparable between the two
groups, but there was a parallel shift between the two curves
due to a difference in basal tone. flow-induced dilations were
also assessed in the presence of inhibitors for nos (l-name),
cox (indo), and cyp/epoxygenase (ppoh), respectively, to
identify the mediators responsible for the responses. similar to
our previous findings in arteries of wt mice, (fig. 1b),
l-name or indo alone inhibited flow-induced dilation by
⬃50%. combined administration of both inhibitors abolished
the responses, indicating that no and pgs participate equally
in their mediation. in arteries of er␣-ko mice (fig. 1c),
l-name had a significantly lesser inhibitory effect (⬃26%) on
the dilation than in those of wt mice. indo inhibited dilations
by ⬃50%, and the remaining portion of dilation was eliminated
by an eet synthase inhibitor, ppoh (fig. 1d), suggesting that
eets are the mediator responsible for the l-name/indo
resistant portion of the responses. in separate experiments
(summarized in fig. 1d), ibtx was used to evaluate the role
of potassium channels in the eet-mediated flow-induced dilation of er␣-ko arteries. ibtx inhibited the dilation as did
ppoh, indicating that eets activate bkca of smooth muscle
of arteries to initiate vasodilation.

of no and prostaglandin synthesis with l-name and indo,
shear stress (10 dyne/cm2)-induced changes in diameter were
recorded in arteries of both control and sirna groups (day 1
in fig. 5a). after incubation of the vessels with and without
aromatase sirna for 72 h (day 4), shear stress-induced dilation was eliminated in sirna-treated vessels but was maintained in control vessels and, furthermore, was abolished by
ppoh or ibtx, indicating that eet-mediated flow-induced
dilation of male er␣-ko arteries is aromatase dependent.

discussion

this is the first study to investigate effects of an er␣
deficiency on arterial regulation of shear stress in male mice.
we demonstrated that flow/shear stress-induced dilation in
male er␣-ko arteries is well maintained via an edhf/eetmediated mechanism compensating for an impaired no-mediated response as a function of estrogen aromatized from testosterone.

er␤ expression (fig. 3c) in isolated arteries of er␣-ko
compared with those of wt mice. moreover, there is a significant increase in aromatase protein expression in vessels of
er␣-ko mice (fig. 3b). these data illustrate that both the
downregulation of no synthesis and upregulation of er␤
could be the consequence of a deficiency of er␣. this, on the
other hand, potentiates vascular cyp activity via a reduced
inhibitory effect of no on cyp and an increased aromatized
estradiol to initiate an er␤-mediated signaling cascade. indeed, biological evidence of a significantly greater production
of eets in arteries of er␣-ko than in those of wt mice by
using gc-ms analysis is shown in fig. 4, which is indicative
of an upregulation of eet synthase or cyp activity. figure 5

er␣ is necessary for both genomic and nongenomic enhancement of no synthesis in the vasculature of both sexes
(9). this was also proven by our present findings showing that
in arteries of er␣-deficient mice, the no-mediated portion of
flow-induced dilation was significantly attenuated (fig. 1c) as
a consequence of reduced enos expression (fig. 3a). we also
found that enos phosphorylation was not significantly different in vessels of er␣-ko and wt mice, as indicated by a
comparable ratio of phospho-enos vs. enos in the two
groups (data not shown). indeed, in response to er␣ deficiency, the vascular production of no is significantly impaired
in both humans and animals (4, 31, 32). on the other hand, a
role for estrogen in the regulation of vascular endothelial
function in males has also been proven since the beneficial
effect of testosterone on the vasculature is dependent upon the
presence of aromatase (18, 19, 22). for example, castration of
male  xxxg1318xxx  ko mice hastens the development of atherosclerosis compared with intact mice, while inhibition of aromatase
in intact mice reverses the protective effect of testosterone to the
level observed in castrated animals (24), indicating that testos-

effects of estrogen in male arterial responses

subsequent studies were focused on the issue as to what is
the mechanism(s) responsible for the preserved endothelial
regulation of shear stress and whether estrogen evokes
beneficial effects via an er␣-independent pathway in male
er␣-ko arteries. we found, as observed previously (10, 36),
that in arteries of wt mice, no and pgs participate equally in
the mediation of flow-induced dilation (fig. 1b). in arteries of
er␣-ko mice, however, l-name had a lesser effect on
flow-induced dilation than in those of wt controls (⬃26% vs.
50%). additional indo maintained its inhibitory effect (by
⬃50%), leaving a portion (⬃24%) of the dilation that is
resistant to l-name and indo (fig. 1, c and d). by using a
specific inhibitor of cyp/epoxygenase, the nature of the mediator was characterized as eets. also, the specific target of
eets was identified as kca channels on smooth muscle since
edhf bioassay studies show that in the presence of 10 dyne/
cm2 shear stress in donor vessels increasing hyperpolarization
and vasodilation of detector vessels were elicited in response to
the perfusate flowing through donor vessels that had been
treated with l-name and indo. this could be prevented by
blocking kca channels in detector vessels or by inhibiting eet
synthesis in donor vessels (fig. 2). thus, it is eets that
mediate the l-name/indo-resistant portion of flow-induced
dilation in arteries of male er␣-ko mice. these results
strongly support our conclusions that eets are the edhf in
arteries of rats and mice (10, 11, 13, 14).

terone can prevent the development of atherosclerosis by its
conversion to estradiol by aromatase. since our previous studies demonstrated the beneficial effect of estrogen on augmenting no-mediated flow/shear stress-induced dilations in gracilis
muscle arteries of mice and rats (9, 12) we originally assumed
that er␣-ko arteries would have reduced flow-induced dilation due to a reduction of no release. however, the results
obtained were contrary to our expectation in that er␣-ko and
wt mice have a comparable magnitude of flow-induced dilation (fig. 1, a–c).

our previous studies demonstrated that in no deficiency,
edhf/eet is responsible for the mediation of endotheliumdependent, flow/shear stress-induced dilation of arteries from
female but not from arteries of male mice and rats, a response
that is purely estrogen- and er-dependent (10, 11, 13, 36) and
therefore has been characterized as a female phenotypic response thus, the present study showing an eet/edhf-mediated flow/shear stress-induced dilation in male er␣-ko mice
seems to challenge our previous conclusions. with respect to
the puzzling emergence of a female phenotypic flow-induced
response in male mice, two issues need to be borne in mind,
namely the relationship between no and edhf/eets and the
role of estrogen in the response.
in physiological conditions, the contribution of edhf to the
regulation of vascular tone is compromised by the presence of
no as indicated by the fact that shear stress-stimulated release
of eets from arteries is only observed when no synthesis is
absent or impaired (9 –11, 13, 36), suggesting a negative
correlation between no and cyp/edhf. indeed, as we demonstrated in er␣-ko mice, protein expression of enos in
arteries were significantly reduced (fig. 3a), whereas arterial
production of eets was significantly increased (fig. 4). these
data are consistent with our functional results showing a switch
from no-mediation to the mediation by eets (fig. 1, c and
d), and provide molecular and biochemical evidence that
forms the basis of eet-mediated dilation to shear stress in
compensation for a reduced er␣-related release of no. although cyp-mediation of flow-induced dilation in arteries/
arterioles is a genomic response, as indicated by the fact that
the response was prevented by transcriptional inhibitors (13),
the specific cyp gene(s) responsible for the upregulation of

effects of estrogen in male arterial responses

eet synthesis in microvessels has not yet been identified. the
identification of the specific gene(s) screened from cyp global
genes (more than 500 genes categorized in 78 families) will
require microarray analysis.
the mechanism responsible for the compensatory upregulation of eets/edhf-mediated dilator pathway elicited by shear
stress has been demonstrated to be an estrogen-dependent
genomic response, since ovariectomy eliminated and estrogen
replacement restored the response (13, 14). in response to er␣
deficiency, changes in er␤ receptor expression and aromatase
activity needed to be addressed. previous studies reported
upregulation of er␤ during the process of vascular injury (20).
in the mediation of estrogen-dependent prevention of vascular
diseases, er␣ and er␤ are able to complement one another
(15, 16), and both mrnas are upregulated by shear stress (23).
similar to er␣, er␤ binds specifically to estrogen-responsive
elements (ere) and activates ere-containing promoters in
response to estrogen (25). we presumed therefore, that a
compensatory upregulation of er␤ in response to er␣ deficiency is responsible for the estrogen-dependent transcriptional
upregulation of eet synthesis in male er␣-ko mice. this
hypothesis is supported by findings showing significant increases in protein expression of er␤ (fig. 3c) in er␣-ko
vessels. importantly, arterial expression of aromatase protein
was also increased (fig. 3b) in er␣-ko mice, which provides
molecular evidence of increases in vascular estradiol concentrations leading to an enhanced eet synthesis (fig. 4) in
vessels of er␣-ko mice.
regarding the specific role of estrogen in the responses,
there is no significant change in circulating estradiol levels in
male er␣-ko mice although there are unusually large increases in serum estradiol in female er␣-ko mice (2, 3, 27).
however, there is increasing evidence that plasma estrogen
levels may be a poor predictor of effective cellular estrogen
concentrations, especially in the vasculature (35). in males,
estrogens independent of plasma levels are produced in significant quantities by local tissues through aromatization of testosterone (5, 7). in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells that
express aromatase mrna, exogenous administration of testosterone elicited a significant production of estradiol (7). thus, in
the present study, the significantly increased concentrations of
circulating testosterone in male er␣-ko mice (27) provide an
extra amount of substrate to be aromatized, especially in the
additional presence of an upregulated aromatase expression
(fig. 3b), to increase the local concentration of estradiol that,
in turn, in a paracrine manner can further upregulate vascular
cyp and eet synthesis (fig. 4) (13). to confirm our conclusions and evaluate the specific effect of aromatase on the
estrogen-dependent, eet-mediated dilator response to shear
stress in vessels of male er␣-ko mice, an sirna was used to
knockdown the aromatase gene in the vessels. in our previous
studies, we have confirmed that eets are the mediator of the
dilation in response to shear stress in mesenteric, as well as
gracilis arteries, when no and pgs are absent (11). as an
estrogen-producing enzyme in the vasculature, aromatase expression in er␣-ko vessels was upregulated. we hypothesized, therefore, that increased vascular estrogen aromatized
from testosterone is responsible for this phenotypically female
response in male er␣-ko vessels. if this hypothesis is correct,
the eet-mediated flow-induced dilation should be eliminated
by knockdown of aromatase in the vessels. thus, we designed
ajp-regul integr comp physiol • vol

an rna interference study, aimed to confirm whether the
eet-mediated flow-induced response is aromatase dependent. eet-mediated, shear stress-induced responses in these
l-name/indo treated-vessels were assessed before and after
silencing the gene for aromatase. in the present study, a period
of 72-h transfection was chosen, based on the necessity for
protein degradation. we found that aromatase sirna specifically knocked down the gene (fig. 5b) and protein expression
(fig. 5c) in the vessels, which was associated with the elimination of eet-mediated dilator response to shear stress (fig.
5a). on the other hand, the maintained shear stress-induced
dilation in time-course control vessels was eliminated by an
inhibitor of eet synthase and a bkca channel blocker, indicating that it is eets that mediate shear stress-induced dilation/
hyperpolarization in an aromatase-dependent manner. thus,
our results suggest that the cardiovascular protective effects of
estrogen are not only of physiological importance in females,
but also in males, since the male cardiovascular system is an
important source, as well as a target, of estrogen.
in summary, our study provides evidence for the upregulation of aromatase and er␤ expressions in vessels of male
er␣-ko mice. we interpret our findings to mean that in male
er␣-ko mice the high plasma testosterone and enhanced
vascular activity of aromatase increase significantly the vascular concentration of estradiol, a female hormone that is necessary for eet/edhf-mediated flow/shear stress-induced dilation of arteries, when no synthesis is impaired. in addition, in
view of the questions raised as to whether the maintenance of
normal vascular tone by estrogen in males requires ers and
whether estrogen’s effect on vascular tone in males is mediated
by no or some other autacoid (22), our studies, by using male
er␣-ko mice, confirmed an association between estrogens
and edhf/eets. thus, a specific pathway is revealed by
which aromatase-derived estrogen through er␤ regulates arterial endothelial function via upregulation of eet synthesis in
the male vasculature to compensate for the impairment of no
synthesis.
