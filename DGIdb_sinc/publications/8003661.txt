the effects of  xxxd1783xxx , a drug that blocks ampa
receptor desensitization, on synaptic responses were stud-
ied in field ca1 of hippocampal slices from adult and neo-
natal rats.  xxxd1783xxx  (100 um) reliably increased
 xxxg981xxx -mediated field epsp decay times in adult
slices but only after prolonged (60-120 min) applications.
in neonatal slices, 30 min applications of  xxxd1783xxx 
were sufficient to produce large and long-lasting increases
in response decay times. since the effects of  xxxd1783xxx 
on  xxxg981xxx  binding properties were similar in
adult and neonatal forebrain membranes, the data indi-
cate that the slow action of the drug in adult slices is prob-
ably due to diffusion barriers. the prolongation of epsp
decay by  xxxd1783xxx  suggests that  xxxg981xxx -
mediated synaptic responses in hippocampus are termin-
ated by receptor desensitization.

introduction

fast excitatory transmission at many sites in mam-
malian brain is mediated by the ampa (a-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazolepropionic acid) subclass
of glutamate receptors. drugs that enhance the oper-
ation of these receptors are of interest both as tools for
investigating the relationship of receptor properties to
specific features of synaptic responses and as potential
therapeutic agents for treating age-related changes in
excitatory receptors and synapses. recent studies indi-
cate that  xxxd1783xxx  is a drug of this type. this
diuretic compound blocks the desensitizing response
of ampa receptors in patches excised from cultured
neurons! and prolongs the duration of synaptic cur-
rents in dissociated cells’? and in the brain stem of
immature birds. its effects on  xxxg981xxx 
mediated currents in mammalian telencephalon have
not been tested but biochemical studies indicate that
 xxxd1783xxx  causes a large reduction in the binding of
phjampa to membrane fractions isolated from this
region.‘ given prior evidence that the desensitized
state of the  xxxg981xxx  has a higher affinity than
its sensitized counterpart,° the effects of  xxxd1783xxx 
on binding constitute evidence that the drug blocks
desensitization or accelerates resensitization in the
mature brain. assuming then, that the transition of the
 xxxg981xxx  into a relatively stable desensitized
state terminates fast excitatory transmission in telen-
cephalon,  xxxd1783xxx  would be expected to cause a
marked increase in the duration of synaptic responses
in hippocampus. the present experiments tested this
prediction.

(postnatal days 6-11) or adult (180-250 g) male
sprague-dawley rats using conventional methods. in
most experiments, slices were maintained in an inter-
face chamber at 35°c and perfused (0.8 ml min”) with
medium (acsf) containing (in mm): nacl 124, kc12,
kh,po, 1.25,  xxxg2125xxx , 3.4, mgso, 2.5, nahco, 26,
d-glucose 10, and l-ascorbate 2. in several additional
experiments, slices were incubated as above for 1 hand
then superfused with the same medium for the dur-
ation of the experiment. one stimulation electrode was
placed in the stratum radiatum of field cala and
another in the same lamina of field caic; a glass
microelectrode filled with 2m nacl was placed in stra-
tum radiatum of field ca1b to record field excitatory
postsynaptic potentials (epsps) evoked by schaffer/
commissural fiber stimulation. responses to homo-
synaptic paired-pulse stimulation (75 ms inter-pulse
interval) to each electrode were recorded alternately
for the two electrodes  xxxd1891xxx  s intervals throughout each
experiment. a priming paradigm consisting of 1 single
pulse to the other (heterosynaptic) electrode 200 ms
prior to paired-pulse stimulation was routinely used to
suppress inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (ipsps);
this paradigm has been shown previously to cause a
50-75% reduction of ipsps.*? responses were also
collected in the absence of priming stimulation at
various time points throughout each experiment.
 xxxd1783xxx  was prepared as a stock solution at 100
mm in 100%  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and diluted
to the desired final concentration in acsf. the drug
was applied by switching the perfusion medium from
control to that containing  xxxd1783xxx . in each
experiment, baseline responses were collected for
10-30 min, then  xxxd1783xxx  was perfused for 30-120
min, and washed out for 30-90 minutes. responses
were digitized by microcomputer (ibm pc-compat-
ible), measured on-line, and stored on disk for detailed

analysis. the measures used for quantitation of the
results were based on averages of eight consecutive res-
ponses recorded at various time points and included
peak amplitude, half-decay time, half-width (duration
at half of peak amplitude), and decay tau (a single
exponential fit to the response between the times it had
decayed from 10% to 50%).

membranes for binding assays were prepared as pre-
viously described, with the following modifications:
the starting tissue was postnatal days 6-11 rat telen-
cephalon and the assay buffer was 100 mm tris acetate,
50 um egta, ph 7.2. hjampa binding studies in
the presence of 50 mm potassium thiocyanate were
performed as previously described,‘ measuring specific
binding of 50 nm hjampa in the absence and pres-
ence of 500 4m  xxxd1783xxx  at three different tem-
peratures. all points were assayed in quadruplicate.

results

figure 1 summarizes two experiments in which 100
um  xxxd1783xxx  was infused into slices for 30 min.
panel a illustrates the most commonly obtained result;
the drug caused no reliable effect on either the ampli-
tude (upper panel) or half decay time (lower panel) of
the field epsp. in some cases, however,  xxxd1783xxx 
did produce the predicted increase in the decay time of
the field epsp, as is evident in the experiment
described in panel b. as shown, the drug had no reli-
able effect on the initial slope and amplitude of the res-

ponse (upper panel) but did produce a substantial
increase in its half decay time. two features of this
effect are noteworthy; (i) the increase in half decay time
began to develop only after 20 min of infusion and (i1)
the effect continued to grow during a 60-min washout
period. table 1 (top) summarizes the percentage
changes in amplitude and three measures of response
decay rate for primed responses in slices of adult hip-
pocampus following 30 min of  xxxd1783xxx  infusion
(n = 17 pathways in nine slices) and a subsequent 30
min of washout (n = 11 pathways in six slices). a stat-
istically significant increase in decay time measures was
obtained at the latter but not the former time point.

the variability in the effect of  xxxd1783xxx , and its
delayed onset of action when effective, suggested that a
30 min infusion provided only a threshold dosage of
the drug. accordingly, additional experiments were
run using 60-120 min infusions with a typical result
shown in figure 2. the decay time of the response
began to increase after 45 min of drug application and
then continued to grow for the remainder of the
infusion period as well as during a subsequent 90 min
washout. the amplitude of the field epsp remained
constant throughout the experiment (upper panel).
comparable results were obtained for seven pathways
tested in four slices. the average maximum drug effect
in these slices was + 0.8% (+1.5) for the amplitude and
+122.3% (+38.2) for the half decay time.

three slices were infused for 60 min with the
 xxxd1783xxx  vehicle 0.1% dmso. in none of the six
pathways tested did any of the decay times measured
increase more than 10% at any time point during the
experiment, including 60-90 min of washout.

ponses in this case in contrast to the adult. records show a control res-

the above results indicate that  xxxd1783xxx  acts
only slowly on synapses in adult brain tissue and that
once in place is very slow to washout. this suggests
that the drug is sequestered into a compartment during
infusion and then released gradually into synaptic
regions. astroglia, which are thought to buffer at least
some  xxxg981xxx  agonists,"' could contribute to
such effects. therefore, the above experiments were
repeated using slices from rats at postnatal days 6-11,
ages at which astroglial processes are much more
poorly developed than is the case for the adult. figure 3
shows the results obtained with a 30 min infusion; as is
evident,  xxxd1783xxx  caused an increase in the decay

time of the response that began about 15 min after the
onset of perfusion and that reached its maximum at 20
min after the cessation of infusion. table 1 (bottom)
summarizes the results for primed responses ina group
of eight slices (15 pathways); a 30 min infusion of
 xxxd1783xxx  was sufficient to produce a reliable pro-
longation of the decay phase of the field epsp and this
effect grew larger over the course of a subsequent 30-
min washout period. the drug not only worked much
more quickly in the neonatal tissue than in the adult but
also produced a larger effect (see table 1). there was
also a tendency for the amplitude of the response in the
immature slices to increase with  xxxd1783xxx 
administration (p < 0.1). comparable results were
obtained in neonatal slices treated with  xxxd1783xxx 
in the presence of the gaba, receptor antagonist,
 xxxd2947xxx  (50 4m), and the n-methyl-p-aspartate
(nmda) receptor antagonist, —p-2-amino-5-
phosphonopentanoate (50 4m) (n = 2), indicating that
the drug effects were not due to suppression of ipsps
or activation of nmda receptors.

the developmental differences just described could
potentially reflect differences in the effects of cyclo-
thiazide on ampa receptors in immature vs mature
synapses. however, tests of the drug’s actions on the
binding of [h]ampa to membrane fractions isolated
from the telencephalon of rats at postnatal days 6-11
produced results that were virtually identical to those
previously reported for membrane preparations from
adult brain. that is,  xxxd1783xxx  reduced binding at
o°c by 68% (+ 2), at 23°c by 57% (+ 2), and at 35°c
by 45% (+3) in the immature telencephalic mem-
branes (7 = 3; values shown are mean + s.e.m.). these
values are similar to those obtained for  xxxd1783xxx ’s
effects on (hjampa binding to adult whole brain
membranes‘ in both magnitude and the degree of tem-
perature dependency.

discussion

cyclothazide caused a sizeable prolongation of syn-
aptic responses in hippocampus while having only
marginal effects on their amplitudes. given prior evi-
dence on the drug’s mode of action (see above), its
effects on the field epsp strongly suggest that fast
excitatory transmission in hippocampus is terminated
by the transition of bound ampa receptors into a

tam which, like  xxxd1783xxx , prolongs the response of
ampa receptors to agonists, '?"" also extends the decay
phase of synaptic responses in hippocampus.’? * how-
ever, unlike  xxxd1783xxx ,  xxxd181xxx  causes only a
minor reduction (5-10%) in ph]ampa binding to

of the field epsp as well as its duration.'*'7!* these
observations raise the possibility that  xxxd181xxx 
affects the opening/closing rates of the ampa recep-
tor as proposed by hestrin.”? it will be of interest to test
for interactions between  xxxd1783xxx  and  xxxd181xxx 
both on the binding properties of ampa receptors and
on the synaptic responses they mediate. it is also note-
worthy that  xxxd1868xxx , a compound structurally
related to  xxxd1783xxx , has been reported to alter field
epsps in hippocampal slices,” although in a manner
different from that reported here for  xxxd1783xxx  (i.e.
equivalent effects on amplitude and duration of the res-
ponse). studies are in progress to compare the effects of
 xxxd1868xxx  and  xxxd1783xxx  on ampa binding to
forebrain membranes.

while producing sizeable effects,  xxxd1783xxx  had
an unexpectedly slow onset of action and rate of wash-
out; the effects of  xxxd181xxx , by comparison, are evi-
dent within 5 min and begin to reverse almost
immediately upon washout in experiments similar to
those described here.'’ the extreme time courses for
 xxxd1783xxx ’s effects suggest that the drug (i) 1s
accumulated and slowly released by one or more tissue
compartments; (ii) is restricted in its entry into and exit
from the synaptic cleft; or (iii) must penetrate the den-
dritic membrane to gain access to an intracellular site of
action. the extended processes of astroglial cells could
contribute to the first two factors on this list and, as
described,  xxxd1783xxx  had more rapid and pro-
nounced effects in immature slices in which astroglia
are only poorly developed. the third possibility listed
above seems unlikely since studies on cultured hippo-
campal neurons have shown that extracellular but not
intracellular injections of  xxxd1783xxx  alter kainate-
evoked responses.” in any event, the age-dependent
differences in  xxxd1783xxx ’s effects provide a useful

starting point in identifying why the drug has so
extreme a time course of action, a question of consider-
able importance in evaluating its possible uses in
behavioral studies.

conclusion

 xxxd1783xxx  produced a significant prolongation
of the decay of field epsps in the ca1 field of hippo-
campal slices. this effect suggests that synaptic res-
ponses mediated by ampa receptors are terminated
by receptor desensitization.  xxxd1783xxx  had more
rapid and larger effects on synaptic responses in slices
from neonatal animals than from adults although the
drug’s inhibition of [/hjampa binding to brain mem-
branes was similar for adult and neonatal samples.
these results suggest that the slow actions of cyclothia-
zide in adult slices are most likely due to diffusion
barriers.
