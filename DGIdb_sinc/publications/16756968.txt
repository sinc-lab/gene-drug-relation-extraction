abstract
background: glucosamine sulfate may have an ex vivo inhibitory effect on the plasminogen activator (pa)/plasmin system and gelatinases
expression during the early development of osteoarthritis (oa).
methods: we compared the levels of urokinase-type pa ( xxxg1767xxx ), pa inhibitor-1 (pai-1) and gelatinases ( xxxg1428xxx  and -9 [ xxxg1428xxx  and -9]) in a series of chondral, meniscal, and synovial cultures of early oa after treatment with or without glucosamine sulfate.
results: gelatin zymography revealed that glucosamine sulfate could suppress  xxxg1428xxx  secretion in chondral, meniscal and synovial cultures
and also decrease  xxxg1440xxx  production in synovial and meniscal cultures. elisa data also showed the suppressive effects of glucosamine sulfate on
 xxxg1767xxx  and pai-1 production in synovial cultures at 48 h.
conclusions: our data suggest that one of the therapeutic effects of glucosamine sulfate is to down-regulate the expressions of  xxxg1767xxx , pai-1,  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  that underlie the destruction of articular cartilage in the early stage of oa, and therefore to delay the joint failure.

1. introduction
both mechanical factors and enzymatic pathways are
involved in articular matrix degradation of osteoarthritis
(oa), which is the major cause of disability in the elderly [1].
in oa knees, the changes involve a disturbed balance between
degradation and repair in the articular cartilage and subchondral
bone accompanied by meniscal tears, capsular fibrosis,
marginal osteophyte formation and a variable grade of
inflammation of the synovial membrane. matrix metalloproteinases (mmps) are zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases
known for their ability to degrade all extracellular matrix
(ecm) constituents, as well as non matrix proteins. these

mmps are secreted as latent precursors and can be activated by
limited proteolysis, which results in a loss of molecular weight
of about 10 kda. type iv collagenases (gelatinases) are
members of the family of mmps and can be divided into
gelatinase-a ( xxxg1428xxx ) and gelatinase-b ( xxxg1440xxx ).
although oa is classically defined as a progressively
degenerative disease of articular cartilage, the key role of
inflammation in the pathogenesis of oa has been pointed out
recently [2]. in arthritic effusions, the increased expressions of
gelatinases steadily reflect the inflammatory condition of the
joints [3–5]. the increased expressions of  xxxg1428xxx  and -9, also
observed in pathologic chondral, meniscal and synovial lesions
of early oa, may play a significant role in oa pathophysiology
[6]; however, the roles of  xxxg1428xxx  and -9 secreted in the joints
on pathogenesis of oa have not been clarified. with a transient
primary culture model of chondral, meniscal and synovial
tissues to act as a system representative of the in vivo environment, proinflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharide

increase gelatinases' secretion but agents that target the protein
kinase c pathway, plasmin/serine proteinase or protein synthesis inhibit gelatinases' production in early oa [7].
plasminogen activators (pas), urokinase- ( xxxg1767xxx ) and tissuetype pa ( xxxg1766xxx ), are serine proteases responsible for the conversion of the circulating zymogen, plasminogen, to generate
the less specific  xxxg745xxx , plasmin [8]. by single proteolytic cleavage, both  xxxg1767xxx  and plasmin produce active forms
of mmps that promote degradation of joint cartilage [9], such as
gelatinases [10] and stromelysins [11].  xxxg1767xxx  is primarily responsible for plasmin generation during connective tissue
breakdown while  xxxg1766xxx  is likely to be relevant to fibrinolysis.
both of them are rapidly inactivated by its specific fast-acting
natural inhibitors, pa inhibitors (pais), which include pai-1,
the main pai form in the circulation, and  xxxg2053xxx  [12].  xxxg1767xxx  is the
predominant pa form in oa, whereas a decreased amount of
pai-1 is found in oa cartilage [13]. clinical improvement of
patients with oa or rheumatoid arthritis (ra) is observed after
intra-articular injection of urinary  xxxd207xxx , which is
shown to inhibit  xxxg1767xxx  [14,15]. additionally, higher pa/plasmin
activity appears in effusions of patients with septic arthritis,
gouty arthritis and ra than that with oa [16,17].
glucosamine, a constituent of glycosaminoglycans, has been
used widely to treat human oa in recent years. several shortand long-term clinical trials in oa have shown significant
effects of glucosamine on improving symptom and structure, as
well as its good safety profile [18–20]. gulcosamine not only
regulates proteoglycan [21] and glycosaminoglycan [22]
synthesis but also suppresses the excess production of no
[23]. thus glucosamine probably provides the structuremodifying effects of therapeutic efficacy in oa. moreover,
glucosamine has an inhibitory effect on the neutrophil
functions, thereby possibly exhibiting anti-inflammatory
actions in oa [24]. however, detailed mechanisms on the
beneficial effect of glucosamine on the disease-modifying effect
and in vivo regulation of the pa/plasmin system and mmps in
human oa joint are still fragmentary and insufficient [25]. in
particular, studies focusing on the diseased synovium and
meniscus, rather than directly on the articular cartilage itself, are
not available. we therefore investigated the ex vivo effects of
glucosamine sulfate on expressions of  xxxg1767xxx , pai-1 and
gelatinases in chondral, meniscal and synovial cultures of
early oa.

final concentration of glucosamine sulfate used in this study
was 10 mug/ml. this concentration of glucosamine sulfate did not
induce cell death and therefore should not cause cytotoxicity or
apoptosis in osteoarthritic chondral, meniscal and synovial
cultures.
2.2. chondral, meniscal and synovial cultures
using the arthroforce® iii forceps (karl storz, germany),
specimens of cartilage, menisci and synovia of over 100 mg
were obtained from the patients with early oa knees (fulfilled
the american college of rheumatology criteria and corresponded to grade ii or iii in anteroposterior weight-bearing,
lateral and merchant's radiographs, according to the kellgren
and lawrence grading scale for the medial, lateral and
patellofemoral compartments) undergoing arthroscopic débridement at chung shan medical university hospital by the
same author [6]. the remainders of the specimen were subjected
to pathological examination to confirm the diagnosis. no
patient had received intraarticular steroid or hyaluronan
injections within the last 3 months before the surgical
procedure. all patients gave informed consent for their surgical
specimens to be studied. each specimen of cartilage, menisci
and synovia was divided into 2 groups respectively (weighted
equally 50 mg), transferred into 24-well tissue culture dishes
and then incubated at 37 °c under a humidified 5% co2
atmosphere in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium (dmem)
supplemented with 2% penicillin–streptomycin (10,000 u/ml)
and 10 mg/ml streptomycin. the tissue culture system
employed has been used previously [3,6,7].
2.3. glucosamine sulfate treatment
after the initial incubation for 3 h, the chondral, meniscal
and synovial tissues were continuously cultured in medium with
or without glucosamine sulfate. appropriate amounts of stock
solution of glucosamine sulfate (5 mg/ml in dmso) dissolved
in dmem was added to each well to achieve the concentrations
of 10 mug/ml, while dmso solution without glucosamine sulfate
was used as blank reagent. culture wells were then incubated
for 4 days and the conditioned media were collected,
respectively, at 3, 24, 48 and 96 h. collected media were
subjected to gelatin zymography and the measurement of  xxxg1767xxx 
and pai-1 levels.

2. materials and methods
2.4. gelatin zymography
2.1. chemicals and materials
all culture materials were from gibco (grand island, ny,
usa). glucosamine sulfate (viartril®-s), from rotta pharmaceuticals (monza, italy), was directly dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (dmso) (merck, darmstadt, germany) and subsequently diluted to achieve the required final concentration in the
culture medium. the final concentration of dmso in the
medium was 0.1% (v/v), which has been proven to be nontoxic
to osteoarthritic chondral, meniscal and synovial cultures.
based on in vitro studies of other laboratories [21,23,25], the

the levels of  xxxg1428xxx  and  xxxg1440xxx  were assayed by loading
the conditioned medium which contained 10 mug of total protein
onto a precast sodium  xxxd3215xxx –polyacrylamide gel
containing 0.1% gelatin followed by an electrophoresis [26,27].
after electrophoresis, gels were processed as described by chu
et al. [7]. with a molecular weight marker being used as mmp
calibrators, gelatin zymograms revealed that the latent form of
 xxxg1428xxx  (prommp-2) migrated at 72 kda and the latent form of
 xxxg1440xxx  (prommp-9) presented at 92 kda regions. the
activated forms of  xxxg1428xxx  and -9 showed a loss of the

s.-c. chu et al. / clinica chimica acta 372 (2006) 167–172

169

propeptide of about 10 kda, respectively. the nonstaining
bands representing the activities of latent and activated forms of
 xxxg1428xxx  and -9 were quantitatively measured by spot density
measurement using a digital imaging analysis system (alpha
innotech, mt. prospect, il, usa). results were calculated as
integrated density value (idv), which was the sum of all the
pixel values after background correction, i.e., idv = ∑(each
pixel value − background value) [3,6]. the levels of  xxxg1428xxx  and
-9 from the treated group were then expressed as optical density
(% of control) in comparison with the control group.
2.5. measurement of  xxxg1767xxx  and pai-1 levels
the  xxxg1767xxx  and pai-1 levels in conditioned media were
measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) kits
for  xxxg1767xxx  and pai-1 from biopool, umea, sweden. from each
conditioned medium, 200 mul of the sample were directly
transferred to the microtest strip wells of the elisa plate and
then assayed by following the manufacturer's instructions. the
absorbance at 495 nm was measured in a microtest plate
spectrophotometer and  xxxg1767xxx  and pai-1 levels were quantitated
with a calibration curve using human  xxxg1767xxx  and pai-1 as a
standard [16,17].
2.6. statistical analysis
all assays were repeated at least three times to ensure
reproducibility. statistical calculations of levels of  xxxg1767xxx  and
pai-1, and the pai-1/ xxxg1767xxx  ratio between the control and
glucosamine sulfate treated groups were performed using
student's t-test. analysis of variance (anova) was used for

(control = 100%) from at least 3 independent experiments. the level of activated
 xxxg1440xxx  was undetectable at 3 h with or without glucosamine sulfate treatment.
anova with scheffe's posteriori comparison was used. prommp-2:
f = 20.156, p < 0.001; activated  xxxg1428xxx : f = 82.298, p < 0.001; prommp-9:
f = 95.196, p < 0.001; activated  xxxg1440xxx : f = 120.545, p < 0.001. asignificantly

when compared to that of 24 h. dsignificantly different, at p < 0.05, when
compared to that of 48 h.

zymograms were quantitated and data were shown in figs. 2–4.
both latent and activated forms of  xxxg1428xxx  were detected in
conditioned media of all chondral, meniscal and synovial
cultures. generally, prommp-2 levels in glucosamine sulfatetreated media significantly decreased since 3 h and continuously
through to day 4, while that in chondral cultures reduced since
48 h (p < 0.001). as for the levels of activated  xxxg1428xxx ,
glucosamine sulfate seemed to have inhibitory effect in
chondral and meniscal cultures since 24 h and in synovial
cultures since 3 h, and these suppressed levels persisted through
to day 4 (p < 0.001). furthermore, these inhibitory effects were
time-dependent.
3.2. effect of glucosamine sulfate on  xxxg1440xxx  level
with zymography, prommp-9 was detected in some
meniscal and all synovial cultures, but not in any of chondral
cultures. the prommp-9 levels of glucosamine sulfate treated
media significantly decreased in meniscal and synovial cultures
from 3 h to day 4 (p < 0.001) (figs. 3 and 4). the levels of
activated  xxxg1440xxx , which was only detectable in synovial

as shown in table 1, constant suppression of  xxxg1767xxx  and  xxxg2058xxx  levels by glucosamine sulfate seemed to be demonstrated in
all tissue cultures at 48 h.  xxxg1767xxx  levels of glucosamine sulfate
treated media in synovial cultures significantly decreased at
48 h (p = 0.008), while the suppressed effect could not be found
in chondral (p = 0.058) and meniscal cultures (p = 0.235).
analogously, an inhibitory effect of glucosamine sulfate on
pai-1 levels in synovial cultures was shown at 48 h (p < 0.001),
while such effect was not demonstrated in chondral (p = 0.057)
or meniscal cultures (p = 0.563). however, the pai-1/ xxxg1767xxx  ratio
was not significantly different between the control and
glucosamine sulfate treated groups in all tissue cultures at 48 h.
4. discussion
pharmacological treatment for oa can be divided into 2
groups: symptom- and disease-modifying drugs [28]. the
objective of this study was mainly to identify whether the
evidence of so-called disease-modifying effect of glucosamine
for oa knee. our major findings include that glucosamine
suppresses the  xxxg1428xxx  and -9 expressions in all tissue cultures
of early oa in a time-dependent manner, and glucosamine also
suppresses the levels of  xxxg1767xxx  and pai-1, upstream enzymes of
 xxxg1428xxx  and -9, in chondral and synovial cultures of early oa.
following oral administration, glucosamine makes its “first
pass” through the liver, is available to the systemic circulation,
and is rapidly incorporated into articular cartilage in man [29].
glucosamine could accumulate in articular cartilage over time
with long-term oral administration; however, it remains to be
established whether changes observed over short-term in these
ex vivo cultures would occur in vivo as a result of long-term
administration. moreover, it also needs to be determined
whether the effect of glucosamine on the proteoglycans
synthesis and release is associated with the down-regulation
of the pa/plasmin system and mmp expressions. further
detailed studies should be undertaken to clarify how glucosamine regulates the pa/plasmin system and mmps in vivo.
when the above effects occur in vivo in joints to alter the course
of oa, glucosamine possesses the chondroprotective effect and
may be termed disease-modifying oa drugs [30].

degenerative tears of the meniscus and cartilage destruction
are considered to be the most important and primary event and
therefore chondrocytes attract most of the attention. in fact,
current evidence suggests that synovial inflammation is
significant in cartilage destruction and is implicated as a central
component of oa pathogenesis [1]. the synovial lining cells
are comprised of different cell populations which appear to be
primarily responsible for producing large amounts of mmps
and cytokines. the inflammation of the membrane through the
synthesis of mediators creates a vicious cycle with more
cartilage being degraded and subsequently provoking more
inflammation. consistent with our previous findings, there is
strong circumstantial evidence that  xxxg1428xxx  participates in the
turnover of normal cartilage matrix, whereas some  xxxg1428xxx  and
 xxxg1440xxx , which are expressed in synovial cultures the most,
facilitate the progressive destruction of the cartilage matrix in
oa [6,7]. the resulting imbalance between the anabolic and
catabolic activities leads to the severe degradation of articular
cartilage observed in oa.
during arthritis,  xxxg1767xxx  is indicated as the principal regulator
of plasmin activity which is able to degrade not only fibrin,
but also proteins of the joint ecm and cartilage [31]. the
balance between pas and pais reflects the level of
fibrinolytic activity in arthritic effusions. in addition to
pais, an increase of  xxxg1767xxx  activity and the expression of its
receptor and reduced  xxxg1766xxx  activity have been reported in
joints of patients with ra and associated with the clinical
severity of disease [32]. in oa, there is a hypercoagulable
and prothrombotic state, with hypofibrinolysis and indirect
evidence of increased fibrin generation [33]. levels of
components of the pa/plasmin system in oa synovia are
reported to be generally lower than those in ra synovia [12].
however,  xxxg1767xxx  in particular has been implicated in the same
way as it has in ra, namely, as playing a role in
inflammation and tissue remodeling [34]. we have also
shown previously that serine proteinase activity is required for
the regulation of  xxxg1428xxx  and -9 in oa [7]. our current
observations of the suppressive effects on  xxxg1767xxx  and pai-1
productions in synovial cultures, although a slight, yet nonsignificant decrease in chondral and meniscal cultures at 48 h,
has indicated that glucosamine plays a critical part to reduce
these destructive processes.
indeed, cultured chondrocytes produce  xxxg1767xxx  spontaneously,
while synovial fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and mononuclear
and polymorphonuclear cells respond with a prominent  xxxg1767xxx 
production upon stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines or
with growth factors [35]. like the data in synovial cultures, the
suppressive potential was observed in chondral and meniscal
cultures, although not significant. overall, these findings give a
better insight into the down-regulation of the pa/plasmin
system and gelatinases by glucosamine, some of which are
beneficial for disease modification in oa. it is likely to
contribute, at least in part, to the apparent irreversibility of the
oa disease process.
successful treatment of oa must effectively control pain and
slow down or reverse progression of the disease. a comparative
study has demonstrated that glucosamine relieves knee oa

171

symptoms to an extent similar to that of non-steroidal
antiinflammatory drugs [36], the most commonly used drugs
in the pharmacological management of oa. the cartilageunrelated effects, such as the inhibition of superoxide-radical
generation or the inhibition of inducible  xxxd2738xxx  synthesis,
can explain the fast onset of action on symptom relief noted in
short-term clinical trials [23]. the reported long-term effects of
the compound on cartilage structure are stimulation of anabolic
activities, such as the synthesis of proteoglycans [21], and the
depression of catabolic activities, such as the effects on mmps
[37]. glucosamine, therefore, has recently received a great deal
of attention from the public as a potential treatment for oa
[38,39].
unlike other published studies using the specimens from
advanced oa in total knee arthroplasty, the targeted patients in
this study were those with early oa knees undergoing
arthroscopic débridement. therefore, we cannot know how
the efficacy of drug treatment in the late stage of oa.
accordingly, exogenous glucosamine may be an attractive
candidate for adjuvant therapy in early oa by exhibiting not
only anti-inflammatory effects but also inhibition of the pa/
plasmin cascade and gelatinases' activation to offer effective
articular cartilage protection. an additional contribution from
other proteolytic enzymes is also possible. still, the exact
mechanisms of the drug should be elucidated in further studies
as they might be of great biological and therapeutic significance
in oa.
