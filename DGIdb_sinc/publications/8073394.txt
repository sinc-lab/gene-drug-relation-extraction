the lysine analogues epsilon- xxxd146xxx  ( xxxd146xxx ) and trans-4-aminomethyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid (amca) are used to prevent excessive
bleeding
in patients
with coagulopathies,
such as hemophilia
and
thrombocytopenia, or in those who have received tissue plasminogen activator
( xxxg1766xxx ). however, their relative efficacy in inhibiting lysis of clots that have been
formed in the presence of exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  or that have been formed and then
exposed to exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  has not been well characterized. the present study
utilized blood from normal volunteers and ‘?-fibrinogen in a dilute whole blood
clot assay to determine the relative concentrations of lysine analogues required
for inhibition of clot lysis induced by exogenous  xxxg1766xxx . amca (0.06 mm) and
 xxxd146xxx  (0.6 mm) were effective in prolonging clot lysis if (1) whole blood clots
were formed and then exposed to a lysine analogue and exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  or if (2)
whole blood clots were formed in the presence of exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  and a lysine
analogue. however, their inhibitory effect was markedly reduced if clots were
formed in the presence of  xxxg1766xxx  and then exposed to either of the lysine
analogues. the analogues did not inhibit the initial binding of  xxxg1766xxx  to fibrin.
they did inhibit binding of plasminogen to fibrin as well as the activation of
plasminogen by  xxxg1766xxx  in the absence of fibrin. the data suggest that lysine
analogues, even at low concentrations, reduce the rate of  xxxg1766xxx  induced whole
blood clot lysis by several mechanisms.

lysine analogues and clot lysis

vol. 73, no. 6

intravascular fibrinolysis is initiated by the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin by  xxxg1766xxx 
on a fibrin surface (1). although  xxxg1766xxx  can activate plasrninogen to plasmin in the absence
of fibrin, the catalytic efficiency is enhanced at least loo-fold when  xxxg1766xxx  and plasminogen
form a complex on fibrin (2). human  xxxg1766xxx  binds to fibrin initially through its finger
domain; as fibrin degradation progresses,  xxxg1766xxx  binding may also occur through the kringle
2 domain (3). binding of plasminogen to fibrin is mediated by lysine-binding sites located
in its five kringle structures (1,4). the first kringle domain has a high affinity binding site
or th e 1ysine analogue  xxxd146xxx  ( xxxd146xxx ) and the others have lower
(&=9rm)f
affinity binding sites (&=5 mm) (5).
the lysine analogues  xxxd146xxx  and trans-4~aminomethyl cyclohexane carboxylic acid (amca)
have been used extensively in viva to inhibit fibrinolysis in order to reduce blood loss that
occurs after mucosal injury (6-11). they are also used in patients who have unacceptable
bleeding while receiving fibrinolytic agents such as  xxxg1766xxx  (12). experimental support for this
treatment has been demonstrated in an animal model (13). in this model, lysine analogues
inhibited bleeding induced by lacerations of the marginal ear vein in rabbits receiving  xxxg1766xxx .
in order to characterize the inhibitory effects of these analogues, we have utilized the dilute
whole blood clot assay as an ex vivo representation of the fibrinolytic system (14,15). in this
assay, dilute whole blood is clotted with thrombin under conditions that result in clot
retraction and in fibrin crosslinking, therefore including cy+ntiplasmin in the clot (16). the
inhibitory effect of the analogues was measured in dilute whole blood clots that had been
formed in the presence of exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  and then exposed to  xxxd146xxx  and amca and in
clots that were first formed and then exposed to the lysine analogues and exogenous  xxxg1766xxx .

‘%dination

of fibrinogen

human fibrinogen was labeled with lzsiby the iodogen procedure (20). a 2 ml solution of
fibrinogen (1 mg/ml) in 0.05 m tris-hcl, 0.10 m nacl, 0.025 m sodium citrate, ph 7.4 was
mixed with 200 &i ‘=i at 22 ‘c for 5 min in a scintillation vial precoated with
20 pg iodogen. unbound ‘=i was separated from labeled fibrinogen by chromatography on
a sephadex g-25 column. radioactivity was measured with a gamma counter (gammatrac’
1193, tm analytic, inc., elk grove village, il). the efficiency of labeling was 32%;
clottability of the radiolabeled fibrinogen was 95% and specific activity was 1.7 x 10’
cpm/mg protein.
plasminogen and  xxxg1766xxx  were iodinated in a similar fashion by incubating 300 pci 1251
with
0.2 mg protein in buffer containing 0.05 m tris, 0.15 m nacl, 0.01% tween-80, ph 7.4 at
4 ‘c for 2 min in a 12x75mm glass tube precoated with 10 pg iodogen. the specific activity
of  xxxg1766xxx  was 3.6~10’cpm/mg and plasminogen 1.4~10’cpm/mg.
dilute whole blood clot lysis

freshly drawn blood (2 ml) was diluted 1:lo in cold (4 “c) phosphate buffer (53 mm
najipo, and 12 mm kh,po.,, ph 7.4) that contained 0.02 pm ?fibrinogen
(14,21). to
2 ml aliquots of this solution were added 20 ~1  xxxg1766xxx  (final concentrations of 3 to 1200
iu/ml), 100 ~1eaca (0.075-0.6 mm, final), amca (0.0075-0.06 mm, final) or buffer, and
40 ~1 thrombin (1 u/ml, final). after the addition of thrombin, the solutions were
incubated for 20 min at 4 ‘c and then transferred to a 37 ocwater bath. the 0 time point
for measurement of clot lysis began with the 37 ‘c incubation. at this time and at fixed
intervals, the radioactivity was measured in 30 ~1aliquots of the supernatants. percent lysis
was calculated as:
corn time x - cnm time 0 x 100
total cpm - cpm time 0
total cpm was the radioactivity of the sample before clotting was initiated. the cpm
determined at time 0 (after clot formation) were 20% of the total cpm, indicating an 80%
incorporation of l”i fibrinogen into the fibrin clot.
in this study the term “clot lysis time” refers to the time required for the release of 50% of
the total counts from the radiolabeled clot.
functional assay of  xxxg1766xxx  activity in the absence of fibrin

 xxxg1766xxx  (50 ~1, 2 iv/ml final) was preincubated with 50 ~1 buffer (0.05 m tris, 0.1 m nacl,
0.1% triton x-100, ph 8.8) or with 50 ~1eaca (0.06,0.6 mm) or amca (0.006,0.06 mm)
for 10 min at 37 ‘c. the mixture was added to 50 ~1 plasminogen (0.1 mg/ml, final) and
plasmin activity was monitored by the addition of 50 ~1 s-2251 (0.25 mm, final) in a 96-well
plate. the change in absorbance at a405 was measured by a titertek multiscan
spectrophotometer (flow laboratories, mclean, va).

studied by preincubating 50 ~1 plasmin (0.01 u/ml, final) with tris-saline-t&on buffer,
ph 8.8 (100 pi), or lysine analogue for 10 min at 37 ‘c, followed by the addition of
s-2251 (50 ~1, 0.25 mm, final). at two hours the change in absorbance was recorded for
plasmin alone, and for  xxxd146xxx  (0.06, 0.6 mm) as well as for amca (0.006, 0.06 mm). to
assess the inhibitory effect of the analogues toward the proteolytic activity of plasmin,
fibrinogen (600 )cl,0.2 mg/ml in phosphate buffer) was mixed with ‘2si-fibrinogen(80 ~1)and
thrombin (20 ~1,5 u), in a 12x75mm glass tube and the clot was wound on a glass rod. to
the supematant was added plasmin (100 ~1,0.25 cia u) and either 200 ~1buffer, or  xxxd146xxx 
(0.6 mm, final) or amca (0.06 mm, fmal). aliquots (10 )tl) were then sampled during 50
min and the results expressed as per cent clot lysis. the assays were performed in triplicate
at 22 oc.
binding of radiolabeled  xxxg1766xxx  umi plasminogen to jbrin

plasminogen-free fibrinogen (1 mg/ml, 0.2 ml) was added to each well of a 24-well plate
(falcon 3047, becton dickinson and company, lincoln park, nj) (22). thrombin (10 ~1,
40 u/ml) was added and the plates were dried at 22 ‘c for 1 hr and subsequently at
37 ‘c overnight. a solution (200 ~1) of ‘%i- xxxg1766xxx (0.3-17 nm) or lzi-plasminogen
(0.6-15 nm) in phosphate buffered saline with 0.01% tween-80, ph 7.4 was incubated with
the fibrin-coated wells for 1 hr at 37 ‘c. the solution contained either no lysine analogues
or  xxxd146xxx  (0.06, 0.6 mm) or amca (0.06, 0.006 mm). the radioactivity of the unbound
protein was measured in the supernatant. the matrix was then washed 5 times with the
incubation buffer containing 10 mg/ml of human  xxxg124xxx , dissolved in 0.2 ml alkaline
urea, and the radioactivity of the bound protein was measured.

effect of lysine anutogues on  xxxg1766xxx  and plmninogen

before performing studies with dilute whole blood clots, we measured the effects of lysine
analogues on the activation of plasminogen by  xxxg1766xxx  in the absence of fibrin.  xxxd146xxx  and
amca at concentrations of 0.06 mm and of 0.006 mm, respectively, caused significant
inhibition of activation of plasminogen by  xxxg1766xxx  as determined by measuring the rate of
conversion of plasminogen to plasmin with the substrate s-2251 (fig. 1). since neither of
these analogues at the concentrations shown in fig. 1 inhibited the amidolytic activity of
plasmin toward s-2251, the inhibitory effect was due to decreased activation of plasminogen
by  xxxg1766xxx  the amidolytic activity of plasmin alone did not differ by more than 3% from the
activity of plasmin in the presence of  xxxd146xxx  (0.06 mm and 0.6 mm) or amca (0.006 mm
and 0.06 mm).
the inhibitory effect of the analogues toward the proteolytic activity of plasmin was assessed
by incubating the analogues with plasmin in the presence of purified fibrin. after incubation
for 20 min, lysis in the absence of analogues was 51 f7%. this was similar to 48f9% for
 xxxd146xxx  (0.6 mm) and was reduced to 23f9% in the presence of amca (0.06 mm).

 xxxd146xxx  and amca both inhibited the binding of plasminogen to fibrin at concentrations of
0.06 mm and 0.006 mm, respectively, with increasing inhibition at ten-fold higher
concentrations (fig. 2). in contrast, the lysine analogues did not inhibit the initial binding
of  xxxg1766xxx  to fibrin (fig. 3).
studies with the purified components indicated that the major antifibrinolytic effects of the
analogues were to inhibit binding of plasminogen to fibrin and conversion of plasminogen
to plasmin by  xxxg1766xxx . in addition, amca but not  xxxd146xxx  at the highest concentration used,
appeared to have an inhibitory effect on plasmin-induced proteolysis of fibrin.
effect of exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  on dilute whole blood clot lysis

in the absence of exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  the dilute whole blood clot lysis was 325&25 min.
the rate of whole blood clot lysis was increased by incorporating exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  into the
forming clot or by exposing the preformed clot to  xxxg1766xxx  (table 1). in subsequent
studies the antifibrinolytic effect of the lysine analogues was determined in dilute whole
blood clots that were formed in the presence of exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  and in clots that were
formed and then exposed to exogenous  xxxg1766xxx . the concentrations of lysine analogues that

in one set of experiments, dilute whole blood containing exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  (3 w/ml, final)
was clotted with thrombin and then lysine analogues were added to the supernatant (fig.
4).  xxxd146xxx  at a final concentration of 0.075 mm caused no significant prolongation of lysis
time (17 f 2 min vs 25 + 5 min, p=o.20, fig. 4a). however, if  xxxd146xxx  at this same
concentration was included with  xxxg1766xxx  before the clot was formed, the lysis time was
significantly increased from 17 f 2 min to 130 + 17 rnin (pco.01). a similar result was
noted for amca at a concentration of 0.0075 mm. these data suggested that  xxxg1766xxx  and
plasminogen that were incorporated into a forming clot before exposure to lysine analogues
were at least partially protected from inhibition.

in the following experiments, clots were formed and then incubated with  xxxg1766xxx  at a

clot formation, thereby having a potential inhibitory effect on the binding of plasminogen
to fibrin as well as inhibition of  xxxg1766xxx  that was added after the clot had formed (fig. 5). the
clot lysis time in the absence of  xxxd146xxx /amca was 95 f 1 min. when either  xxxd146xxx  (0.075
r&i) or amca (0.0075 n&l) were added before clot formation,  xxxg1766xxx  induced lysis was
prolonged by two-fold or greater. a similar degree of inhibition occurred when the  xxxd146xxx 
or amca at these concentrations was added after the clot had formed and before  xxxg1766xxx  was
added.
at higher concentrations,
the inhibitory effects of the analogues was more
pronounced when added before clot formation.

lysine analogues and clot lysis

427

the overall effect of lysine analogues on  xxxg1766xxx  induced whole blood clot lysis is summarized
in table 2. lysine analogues were most effective at both low and higher concentrations
when included with  xxxg1766xxx  before formation of the fibrin clot. their inhibitory effect was
markedly attenuated with clots that were formed in the presence of  xxxg1766xxx  and then exposed
to  xxxd146xxx  or amca a ten-fold lower concentration of amca provided an inhibitory
effect similar to that of  xxxd146xxx .
discussion
the present study indicates that low concentrations of lysine analogues exhibit their greatest
inhibitory potential if they are present at the time when  xxxg1766xxx  is being incorporated into the
forming clot. at higher concentrations (0.6 mm for  xxxd146xxx  and 0.06 mm for amca), they
have significant inhibitory effect against preformed clots that are exposed to  xxxg1766xxx . current
recommendations for the use of  xxxd146xxx  in patients who have received thrombolytic agents
are for the infusion of 0.5 to 1.0 gram/hour, which would provide plasma levels of
approximately 0.33 to 0.67 mm (23). these are well above the concentrations needed to
inhibit lysis induced by incorporation of  xxxg1766xxx  into the forming clot in vitro. other authors
have reported the satisfactory use of doses of  xxxd146xxx  as low as 6 grams per day in
preventing excessive bleeding with patients who have thrombocytopenia (9). the present
study suggests that such a dose, which would result in plasma levels of approximately 0.17
mm (23) could still be effective in inhibiting fibrinolysis. the study also suggests efficacy
for amca at concentrations lower than the recommended levels, which are reported as
0.032-0.064 mm (6). although the higher concentration of amca (0.06 mm) had an
inhibitory effect on plasmin-induced proteolysis,  xxxd146xxx  at the higher concentration (0.6
mm) showed no inhibition. at these concentrations, no inhibitory effect towards the
amidolytic effect of plasmin was shown by these analogues. the ability of lysine analogues
to inhibit the proteolytic activity of plasmin without affecting the amidolytic activity has been
previously reported (24).
the dilute whole blood clot lysis was chosen as an in vitro system that is similar to the clots
formed in viva in that both cellular and noncellular components were present in the system.
in the dilute whole blood clot lysis assay described in this report, endogenous  xxxg1766xxx 
comprised less than 5% of the activity of the exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  (25). at the concentration of
exogenous  xxxg1766xxx  (3 iii/ml) used in the present study, the dilute whole blood clots lysed
quickly as long as  xxxg1766xxx  was incorporated into the forming clot. however, if the clot was
formed first and then exposed to  xxxg1766xxx , a 400-fold greater concentration of the enzyme was
required to obtain a similar lysis time (table 1). a partial explanation for this may be the
lack of binding sites for  xxxg1766xxx  in the whole blood clot that has undergone retraction (26).
using purified components, investigators have demonstrated that  xxxg1766xxx  initially binds to
fibrin through the finger domain which is not a lysine binding site (3). further binding may
occur through the kringle 2 domain as fibrin undergoes digestion by plasmin with exposure
of c-terminal lysine sites on fibrin (27-29). the kringle 2 domain is also critical for the
enhanced activation of plasminogen by  xxxg1766xxx . as fibrin undergoes degradation, the
additional lysine binding sites that are available provide for increased binding of
plasminogen (30). during the course of fibrinolysis, the lysine analogues would have

the inhibitory activity in a system of purified components cannot necessarily predict what
will occur in a more complex system such as the dilute whole blood clot lysis assay. the
present study indicates that low levels of analogues are inhibitory in this system and that
multiple mechanisms are probably responsible for inhibition at low and at higher
concentrations of analogues.
