association of vasopressin 1a receptor levels with a regulatory microsatellite and behavior.  vasopressin regulates complex behaviors such as anxiety, parenting, social engagement and attachment and aggression in a species-specific manner. the capacity of vasopressin to modulate these behaviors is thought to depend on the species-specific distribution patterns of vasopressin 1a receptors (v1ars) in the brain. there is considerable individual variation in the pattern of  xxxg229xxx  binding in the brains of the prairie vole species, microtus ochrogaster. we hypothesize that this individual variability in  xxxg229xxx  expression levels is associated with individual variation in a polymorphic microsatellite in the 5' regulatory region of the prairie vole  xxxg229xxx  gene. additionally, we hypothesize that individual variation in  xxxg229xxx  expression contributes to individual variation in vasopressin-dependent behaviors. to test these hypotheses, we first screened 20 adult male prairie voles for behavioral variation using tests that measure anxiety-related and social behaviors. we then assessed the brains of those animals for  xxxg229xxx  variability with receptor autoradiography and used polymerase chain reaction to genotype the same animals for the length of their 5' microsatellite polymorphism in the  xxxg229xxx  gene. in this report, we describe the results of this discovery-based experimental approach to identify potential gene, brain and behavior interrelationships. the analysis reveals that  xxxg229xxx  levels, in some but not all brain regions, are associated with microsatellite length and that  xxxg229xxx  levels in those and other brain regions correlate with anxiety-related and social behaviors. these results generate novel hypotheses regarding neural control of anxiety-related and social behaviors and yield insight into potential mechanisms by which non-coding gene polymorphisms may influence behavioral traits.
