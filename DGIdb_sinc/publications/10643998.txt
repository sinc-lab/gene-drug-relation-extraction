a review of recent advances on the regulation of pigmentation in the human epidermis.  it has been recognised that the active transport of l-phenylalanine and its autocrine turnover to l-tyrosine via  xxxg1660xxx  in the cytosol of epidermal melanocytes provides the majority of the l-tyrosine pool for melanogenesis. in this context, it has been shown that the cofactor 6(r)-l- xxxd2033xxx   xxxd3166xxx  (6bh4) is produced de novo, recycled and regulated in both epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes to control  xxxg2276xxx ,  xxxg1660xxx  and tyrosinase activity. inhibition of the enzymes by excessive 6bh4 levels is reversible with  xxxg1801xxx  by specific complex formation between 6bh4 and the hormone. this direct mechanism of  xxxg1801xxx  is supported by the presence of the entire pomc processing system in the melanosome indicating a receptor independent control of eumelanogenesis. finally, the role of tyrosinase,  xxxg2332xxx  and  xxxg614xxx  is discussed in association with oxidative stress specifically related to  xxxd2298xxx . these recent findings are based on detailed investigations of the depigmentation disorder vitiligo and hermanský-pudlák syndrome.
