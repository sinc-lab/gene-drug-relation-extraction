the nucleus accumbens (nac) is central to heroin addiction. activation of opiate receptors in the nac dissociates gi/o into ␣ and ␤␥
subunits. g␣i inhibits camp production, but ␤␥ regulates several
molecular pathways, including  xxxg1836xxx  (pka). we show in
nac兾striatal neurons that opiates paradoxically activate pka signaling by means of ␤␥ dimers. activation requires g␣i3 and an
activator of g protein signaling 3 (ags3). ags3 competes with ␤␥
for binding to g␣i3–gdp and enhances the action of unbound ␤␥.
ags3 and g␣i3 knockdown prevents opiate activation of pka
signaling. in rats self-administering heroin, ags3 antisense in the
nac core, but not shell, eliminates reinstatement of heroin-seeking
behavior, a model of human relapse. thus, g␣i3兾␤␥兾ags3 appears
to mediate ␮ opiate receptor activation of pka signaling as well as
heroin-seeking behavior.

eroin addiction, a worldwide socioeconomic and public
health problem, is difficult for physicians to treat, often
because addicts frequently relapse when they try to stop using
heroin during abstinence. heroin activates opiate receptors (1).
however, we do not understand the postsynaptic cellular mechanisms produced by ␮ opiate receptor (mor) activation that
contribute to craving for and relapse to heroin. sharma et al. (2)
provided pioneering evidence in ng108-15 cells that ␦ opiate
receptor (dor) activation initially decreases camp levels,
followed by restoration of camp to normal levels during continued exposure to morphine; camp increases further in response to opiate receptor blockade. many investigators have
confirmed an opiate-induced increase of camp兾protein kinase
a (pka) signaling that is exaggerated upon opiate withdrawal
(3, 4). in vivo, increased camp兾pka activity may be associated
with opiate-induced tolerance and dependence and is thought to
contribute to the reinforcing properties of opiates (5).
postsynaptic gi/o-coupled opiate receptors are expressed on
gabaergic medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens
(nac), a brain region thought to account, in part, for craving,
reward, and reinforcement of addicting drugs (6, 7). mor and
dor activation dissociates heterotrimeric gi/o proteins into free
␣ and ␤␥ subunits. g␣i released from gi/o␤␥ inhibits several
isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (ac) (8) and appears to account for
opiate inhibition of camp production. by contrast, ␤␥ dimers,
which are simultaneously released during receptor activation,
can stimulate  xxxg68xxx  and ac4 (9–13). however, the precise
molecular mechanisms that facilitate this paradoxical gi/ocoupled opiate receptor-induced stimulation of camp兾pka
signaling are not clearly understood.
recent evidence suggests that an activator of g protein
signaling 3 (ags3) regulates g protein signaling in the nac (14).
by competing with ␤␥ for binding to g␣i3, ags3 appears to
stabilize a specific g␣i3–gdp complex formed before the reassociation of free g␣i3 and ␤␥ subunits (15). the bound form of
g␣i3 does not inhibit ac. both ags3 and mor are highly

expressed in the nac (6, 16). this expression suggests that ags3
could play a role in mor-induced g protein signaling and
heroin addiction. here, we identify g␣i3 and ags3 in primary
nac兾striatal cultures as molecular components preferentially
associated with the mor. g␣i3 and ags3 appear to be required
to enhance the action of free ␤␥ dimers, which mediate mor
stimulation of pka signaling. relapse, or reinstatement of
heroin addiction, is a major limitation for effective treatment of
human heroin addiction. in rats trained to self-administer heroin, we find that selective expression of ags3 antisense in the
nac core prevents reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior, a
valid model of human heroin craving and relapse. by contrast,
ags3 antisense in the nac shell is without effect. these findings
suggest that ags3 may play a critical role in mor stimulation
of pka signaling in nac neurons and in the development or
maintenance of heroin addiction.
methods
preparation and analysis of cells. cells were prepared from nac兾

striatum of newborn (postnatal day 0) male sprague–dawley rat
pups, plated at 5 ⫻ 104 cells per slide, and grown in neurobasal
a medium (gibco) supplemented with b27 supplement
(gibco) and glutamate. one-half of the medium was changed
1 day after plating and weekly thereafter. cells were treated on
day 10. immunostaining and images were obtained as described
in ref. 17. for quantification of pka c␣ translocation, random
fields on each slide were selected, and cells scored for pka c␣
staining in golgi, nucleus, cytoplasm, and neurites. for all
experiments, at least five fields were scored for each experiment
for a total number of at least 40 cells per slide. data shown were
obtained by two independent observers who were blind to the
experimental condition. staining for  xxxd2431xxx  decarboxylase indicates that ⬎90% of cells are gabaergic neurons (data
not shown).
total rna was isolated by using trizol (invitrogen) and
treated with dnase. first-strand cdna was synthesized by using
1 ␮g of rna in a final volume of 40 ␮l containing 0.5 ␮g of
oligo(dt), 500 ␮m each dntp, and 20 units of superscript
reverse transcriptase (gibco). ten microliters of this reaction
was taken for pcr using ags3-specific primers. pcr was
performed at 94°c for 30 s, 55°c for 30 s, and 72°c for 30 s for
25 cycles. pcr products were analyzed on a 1.2% agarose gel.

preparation of membrane and solubilized mor. confluent primary
nac兾striatal cultures in 100-mm dishes were washed with pbs
and homogenized with a brinkmann polytron homogenizer in 1
ml of buffer (20 mm tris, ph 7.4兾1 mm egta兾1 mm mgcl2兾
250 mm sucrose). the homogenate was centrifuged at 120 ⫻ g
for 30 min. the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at
27,000 ⫻ g for 30 min. crude membrane pellet was resuspended
in buffer a, which contains 50 mm hepes (ph 7.4), 100 mm
nacl, 5 mm mgcl2, 2 mm edta, 1 mm egta, 2 mm dtt,
and a protease inhibitor mixture (roche molecular biochemicals). membranes were centrifuged at 27,000 ⫻ g for 30 min,
resuspended in fresh buffer a, incubated with 100 nm [d-ala2,nmephe4,gly5-ol]enkephalin (damgo) for 10 min at 30°c, and
then chilled on ice for 10 min. 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate was added to the membrane suspension to obtain a final concentration of 10 mm. the preparation was incubated on ice with moderate agitation for 30 min
and subsequently centrifuged for 1 h at 50,000 ⫻ g. the
supernatant fraction was saved for immunoprecipitation.
immunoprecipitation and western blotting. solubilized membranes,
prepared from cells stimulated with 100 nm damgo, were
immunoprecipitated with anti-mor antibodies. protein complexes were captured by adding protein a兾g-sepharose beads
(santa cruz biotechnology) and continuing the incubation for
30 min at 4°c. the mixture was then microcentrifuged at 4°c, and
pellets were washed and resuspended in 2⫻ laemmli loading
buffer. resuspended samples were boiled for 5 min, and supernatant was loaded on 10% sds兾10% page. membrane transfer
and protein detection were carried out as described in ref. 17.
animal surgery and behavioral assay. sprague–dawley male rats

were anesthetized, implanted with jugular catheters and bilateral
intracranial guide cannulas, and trained as described in refs. 19
and 20. after animals met maintenance criterion (active lever
presses do not vary by ⬎10% across three consecutive days),
extinction and reinstatement were conducted as described (19,
20), except that a heroin prime was used. before reinstatement,
animals received a microinfusion of ad5ags3 as or ad5lacz.
ad5lacz was used to confirm viral expression and to control for
the effect of viral expression on reinstatement. on days 4–6 after
infusion, the subjects were returned to extinction conditions.
reinstatement testing was conducted on day 7 after infusion.
each rat received a priming injection of heroin (0.25 mg兾kg s.c.)
before placement in the self-administration chamber for a 3-h
extinction session. after behavioral testing, rats were anesthetized, and brains were fixed and sectioned as described in ref. 19
to verify infusion sites. there was no evidence of toxicity on
histological examination of the nac from experimental animals
(data not shown).

results
activation of mor induces pka signaling. damgo (100 nm) or

morphine (100 nm) each causes activation and translocation of
pka c␣ from golgi to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and neurites in
primary nac兾striatal neurons (fig. 1a). ctop, a mor antagonist, or rp-adenosine 3⬘,5⬘-cyclic monophosphorothioate (rpcamps), a pka inhibitor, blocks damgo and morphineinduced pka translocation (fig. 1 a). by contrast, activation of
nonaddictive gi/o-coupled adrenergic receptor ␣2b or muscarinic receptor m4 by uk 14,304 or carbachol, respectively, has
no effect (data not shown). as a positive control,  xxxd1742xxx , a
direct and potent activator of ac, causes pka activation and
translocation, like damgo and morphine (fig. 1 a).
pka c␣ translocated into the nucleus phosphorylates crebinding protein (creb) leading to increased cre-mediated
gene expression. damgo increases creb phosphorylation in
10 min (fig. 1b) and cre-mediated luciferase activity 5 h later
(fig. 1c); these effects also are blocked by ctop or rp-camps.
as a positive control,  xxxd1742xxx  produced a similar activation
(fig. 1 b and c). these data suggest that increases in campdependent signaling and cre-mediated gene expression are
mor- and pka-dependent.

herpes simplex virus (hsv) vectors expressing antisense
rna were created by cloning antisense oligonucleotides into
hsvlacz vector under control of mouse u6 polymerase iii
promoter. the sequences for ags3 antisense correspond to
nucleotides 306–330 of ags3. the sequences of antisense for
g␣i, g␤, or g␥ were designed as described in ref. 18. ad5ags3

mor is preferentially coupled with g␣i3. activation of gi/o-coupled

receptors is thought to inhibit camp production by means of
g␣i, but mor activation also can paradoxically stimulate
camp兾pka signaling (12, 21). we asked whether mor couples
with a specific g protein to facilitate ac stimulation. solubilized
rat nac兾striatal membranes were immunoprecipitated with
anti-mor antibodies and western-blotted with anti-g␣o, -g␣i1,
-g␣i2, -g␣i3, or -g␣olf plus mor (fig. 2a). we found that only
g␣i3 coimmunoprecipitates predominately with mor (fig. 2 a),
suggesting that mor interacts preferentially with g␣i3. this
finding was confirmed functionally by using as directed against
g␣i1, g␣i2, g␣i3, or g␣olf to knock down expression of each of
these proteins in nac兾striatal neurons (fig. 2b). knockdown of
g␣i3 specifically blocks damgo-induced pka c␣ translocation (fig. 2c) and cre-mediated luciferase activity (fig. 2d).
in contrast, as for g␣i1, g␣i2, or g␣olf was without effect (fig.
2c). in control studies, as directed against g␣olf, but not g␣i3,
blocks g␣s兾g␣olf-coupled  xxxd124xxx -induced pka signaling (fig. 2 c and d). antisense for g␣i1 or g␣i2 does not
change damgo-induced pka c␣ translocation (fig. 2c) or
cre-mediated gene expression (data not shown), confirming
the preferential requirement of g␣i3.
ags3 enhances mor-induced pka signaling. ags3 also appears to

interact preferentially with g␣i3, which is released upon mor
activation. when ags3 binds to g␣i3, a stable ags3–g␣i3–

gdp complex is formed that maintains inactivation of g␣i3,
thereby limiting g␣i3 recycling and its potential inhibition of ac
(15). ags3 and mor are expressed in the nac (6, 16).
therefore, ags3 could modulate mor signaling through g␣i3.
by using immunocytochemistry, we determined that ags3 and
g␣i3 are expressed and colocalized in membranes, cytoplasm,
and golgi in primary nac兾striatal neurons (fig. 3a). as
directed against ags3 knocks down ags3 mrna and protein
by ⬎80% (fig. 3 b and c) and prevents damgo-induced pka
c␣ translocation (fig. 3d) and cre-mediated luciferase activity
(fig. 3e). by contrast, ags3 as is without effect on  xxxd124xxx -induced pka translocation and gene expression,
because this activation depends on g␣olf or g␣s, not g␣i3 (fig.
3 d and e). these findings are consistent with the possibility that,
after mor-induced release of g␣i3 and ␤␥ subunits, ags3
competes with ␤␥ binding to a g␣i3–gdp complex (22), thereby
enhancing mor-dependent stimulation of ac by ␤␥. this
possibility was confirmed in nac兾striatal neurons preincubated
with ptx to inhibit g␣i/o dissociation into ␣i3 and ␤␥, or the
 xxxd3107xxx ␤ xxxg227xxx  dominant-negative minigene to inhibit the action of
␤␥ (23). we find that ptx or  xxxd3107xxx ␤ xxxg227xxx  each blocks
damgo- or morphine-induced pka c␣ translocation (fig.
1 a), creb phosphorylation (fig. 1b), and cre-mediated
luciferase expression (fig. 1c).
mor activation stimulates  xxxg68xxx  and ac4. several lines of evidence

indicate that ␤␥ dimers stimulate  xxxg68xxx , ac4, and perhaps ac7
(9–13). western blot analysis shows that  xxxg68xxx , ac4, and ac7 are
expressed in primary nac兾striatal neurons; as against  xxxg68xxx ,
ac4, or ac7 knocks down the expression of each isoform,

respectively (fig. 4a). damgo-induced pka c␣ translocation
(fig. 4b) and cre-luciferase expression (fig. 4c) are inhibited
by  xxxg68xxx  and ac4 antisense. antisense for ac3 and ac7 have no
effect on damgo-induced pka signaling (fig. 4 b and c and
data not shown). these findings suggest that  xxxg68xxx  and ac4,
which are known to be expressed in the nac (24, 25), appear to
be required for ␤␥-mediated stimulation of camp兾pka signaling upon mor activation.
ags3 is required for heroin-seeking behavior. mor activation of

pka signaling in nac兾striatal neurons requires ags3. the nac
core has been implicated in heroin-induced reinstatement of
drug-seeking behavior (25). heroin self-administration was established in rats (26). we asked whether heroin-induced reinstatement would be regulated by ags3 in the nac. expression
of ags3 antisense in the core of the nac abolishes heroinseeking behavior but is without effect when expressed in the nac
shell (fig. 5). moreover, ags3 as in the nac did not affect
heroin reinforcement as measured by heroin self-administration
(data not shown). therefore, ags3 appears to be required in the
nac core primarily for the reinstatement of heroin-seeking
behavior, a model of human relapse.
discussion
in this paper, we identify an important mor-activated pathway
in nac兾striatal neurons that stimulates camp兾pka signal
transduction, followed by activation of cre-mediated gene
expression. ags3 appears to be a key component of this
yao et al.

pathway, because it is required for mor-induced pka signaling
in primary nac兾striatal neurons. ags3 in the core of the nac
is also required for reinstatement of heroin-seeking behavior.
our major findings are that: (i) g␣i3 and ags3 associate
preferentially with the mor in nac兾striatal neurons, which
appears to provide specificity for mor-induced release of ␤␥
dimers from gi/o; (ii) g␣i3, ags3, and ␤␥ dimers are required
for mor stimulation of camp兾pka signaling and cremediated gene expression in nac兾striatal neurons; and (iii)
ags3 in the core of the nac is required for heroin-seeking
behavior during opiate withdrawal. mor agonists paradoxically
induce pka c␣ activation and translocation to the nucleus and
creb phosphorylation within 10 min, followed by cremediated gene expression hours later (fig. 1). these events
appear to be determined first by the predominant association of
the mor with g␣i3 (fig. 2) and subsequently, after g␣i3 and ␤␥
subunits are dissociated upon mor activation, by the binding
interaction of g␣i3 with ags3 (figs. 2 and 3). ags3 is thought
to bind transiently to the gdp-bound conformation of g␣i3,
maintaining attenuation of g␣i3 inhibition of ac (15). simultaneously, by competing with ␤␥ for binding to g␣i3 (22), ags3
delays the reassociation of free ␤␥ dimers with g␣i3 and would
be expected to prolong ␤␥ stimulation of camp production
unencumbered by g␣i inhibition (27). thus, interventions to
prevent ags3 from binding to the g␣i3–gdp complex would be
expected to hasten reassociation of free ␤␥ dimers with g␣i3,
thereby reducing ␤␥ stimulation of ac. consistent with this
possibility, as knockdown of ags3 selectively prevents mordependent increases in camp兾pka signaling (fig. 3); whereas
as knockdown of  xxxg1218xxx  and ags2 is without effect (data not
shown).
the nac core is thought to contribute to addictive behaviors
(28). inactivation of the nac core, but not the shell, inhibits
heroin self-administration (26) and heroin-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior (k.m., unpublished data). further, self-administration of heroin is associated with upregulation of gene transcripts involved in neuronal function
within the nac core but down-regulation of these same tranpnas 兩 june 14, 2005 兩 vol. 102 兩 no. 24 兩 8749

scripts within the nac shell (29). notably, inactivation of the
nac core (but not shell) (19, 30) or interference with prefrontal
glutamatergic projections to the nac core (20) also prevents
cocaine-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking behavior (14). in
that study, ags3 as in the prefrontal cortex prevented relapse
of cocaine-seeking behavior. in this study, ags3 as in the nac
core, but not the shell, abolishes reinstatement of heroin-seeking
behavior during withdrawal, a valid model of relapse in human
heroin addiction (fig. 5). it is of interest that ags3 as in the
nac did not block heroin reinforcement as measured by heroin
self-administration (data not shown). this result argues for a
specific effect of ags3 as on reinstatement and that mor
receptor blockade is not involved in this action. our findings are
consistent with current concepts about the special importance of
the core of the nac in addictive behavior (25, 27) and suggest
that ags3 in the core may regulate craving and relapse in heroin
addiction.
the specific requirement for ags3 in mor-activated
camp兾pka signaling appears to depend on the preferential
association of g␣i3 with the mor (fig. 2 a). thus, knockdown
of g␣i3 eliminates mor-induced pka signaling and cre
gene expression; knockdown of other g␣i subunits is without
effect (fig. 2c and data not shown). we propose that in the
absence of g␣i3, when ␤␥ dimers would be rapidly degraded
(31), a g␣i3␤␥ complex is not available to dissociate upon
mor activation so that free ␤␥ is not formed and cannot
stimulate  xxxg68xxx  or ac4 (12). thus, g␣i3 as well as ags3
appears to be required for ␤␥ action. our finding that the
mor preferentially interacts with g␣i3 (fig. 2 a) is consistent
with other reports that g␣i3 is associated with the mor and
the dor (32). however, adrenergic receptor ␣2b and muscarinic receptor m4, which are coupled primarily to g␣i2, only
inhibit camp production in the same cells (data not shown)
and do not activate pka signaling (10, 33, 34). this result
suggests that the preferential association of g␣i3 with the
mor appears to be required for ags3 regulation of ␤␥stimulated camp兾pka signaling. however, we have not
proven that ags3兾␤␥ regulation of pka signaling, which we
show in nac兾striatal neurons in vitro, is responsible in the nac
for ags3兾␤␥ regulation of heroin-seeking behavior in vivo.
other actions of ␤␥ subunits, such as activation of g proteinactivated inwardly rectifying potassium channels, could also be
involved (35).
a prevailing concept is that short-term activation of mor and
dor only inhibits ac activity. several laboratories, however,

find that increased camp production can be detected within
minutes after exposure to opiate agonists (10, 12, 21, 36, 37). our
work suggests that unbound ␤␥ dimers could be responsible for
these recent observations. moreover, our studies also suggest the
possibility that ␤␥ dimers may play a more general role in cellular
mechanisms involved in addiction to other drugs. dopamine d2,
␦-opioid, and cannabinoid cb1 receptors also appear to be
coupled preferentially to g␣i3 (38, 39). we find that ␤␥ dimers
are required for dopamine, opiate, cannabinoid, and ethanol
stimulation of camp兾pka signaling and for voluntary alcohol
consumption (10, 17). thus, g␣i3, ␤␥, and ags3 appear to be
components of a regulatory mechanism shared in common by
those gi/o-coupled receptors involved in addiction. it is well
established that ␤␥ dimers have diverse effects in cells, including
stimulation of pka signaling by means of  xxxg68xxx  and ac4 (11, 40),
which could be involved in addiction (3).
uncontrolled craving and relapse is perhaps the most important clinical problem that limits effective medical treatment of
addiction. current concepts suggest that reinstatement during
withdrawal is a valid model of human drug-seeking behavior
(craving). one of our most important findings during heroin
withdrawal is that as directed against ags3 in the core of the
nac, but not the shell, abolishes reinstatement in heroinaddicted rats. this finding is consistent with recent findings that
ags3 appears to be required for cocaine-induced behavioral
sensitization and reinstatement (14). we propose that, by competing with ␤␥ for binding to the g␣i3–gdp complex (22), ags3
enhances the action of ␤␥ dimers, and that g␣i3, ags3, and ␤␥
dimers appear to be components of a signaling pathway that
underlies addictive behavior. our results suggest that molecular
mechanisms that differentially regulate the action of g␣i3,
