effective against  xxxg791xxx  kinase (10). indeed, it proved to be
a potent inhibitor of leukemogenesis induced by the  xxxg791xxx 
fusion kinases (11,12). however, it is still not clear whether
 xxxd2985xxx  potently inhibits nsclc cell growth or blocks
progression of tumors with  xxxg791xxx  overexpression. in the
present study, we found that approximately half (30 out of
59) of all nsclc cases showed a >2-fold increase in transcriptional activity of  xxxg791xxx  compared with their adjacent
‘normal’ tissue counterparts by using quantitative rt-pcr,
indicating that not only genomic amplification of  xxxg791xxx  but
also transcriptional overexpression of  xxxg791xxx  is a relative
common molecular signature in nsclc. we further demonstrated that  xxxd2985xxx  can effectively and specifically suppress
cell growth in lung cancer cell lines as well as in primary
lung cancer cell cultures with overexpression of  xxxg791xxx . this
growth inhibition by  xxxd2985xxx  is associated with inactivation
of  xxxg791xxx  and its downstream targets. our data suggest that
 xxxd2985xxx  is a potent drug for targeted therapy in lung cancer
patients with amplification of  xxxg791xxx , and provide a rationale
for further evaluation preclinically and clinically.

to initiate the study, we first evaluated
published global gene expression array datasets from the
transcriptomics of cancer cell line project (950 assays,
e-mtab-37, european bioinformatics institute). this dataset
contains triplicate expression profiles of various cancer cell
lines. using the genepattern software program (http://www.
broadinstitute.org) we re-analyzed data for lung cancer cell
lines and found that  xxxg791xxx  was overexpressed in 38% (35
out of 89) of lung cancer cell lines compared with wi38
normal human fetal lung fibroblast cells and normal human
lung tissue (fig. 1a). to determine whether overexpression of
 xxxg791xxx  also occurs in primary human lung cancers, we identified 88 nsclc samples with matched normal lung tissues
resected from lung cancer patients at the shanghai pulmonary

hospital. after total rna isolation, we identified 59 pairs
of high quality matched rna samples suitable for further
analysis. the clinical features of these 59 nsclc patients are
presented in table i. we used real-time rt-pcr to quantify
human  xxxg791xxx  mrna levels and demonstrated that 30 out of
59 (50.8%) tumors showed a >2-fold increase in  xxxg791xxx  mrna
expression compared with their adjacent normal counterparts
(fig. 1b). five (8.5%) tumors showed lower expression levels
compared with the matched normal lung tissues (fig. 1b). we
did not observe a significant difference between smokers and
non-smokers (table i).

the frequent
upregulation of fgfr in primary lung cancers suggests that
targeting the  xxxg791xxx  signaling pathway using pharmacological
inhibitors may be an effective way to restrict nsclc growth.
our previous research targeting fgrf1 fusion kinases in
stem cell leukemia/lymphoma syndrome, demonstrated that
 xxxd2985xxx , a multiple  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitor, can effectively
suppress  xxxg791xxx  fusion kinase activity and subsequently
inhibit cell growth in vit ro
and leukemogenesis in mouse
models in vio
(12). this study demonstrated that  xxxd2985xxx 
was more potent than several other available  xxxg791xxx  inhibitors, such as  xxxd1932xxx  and pd17142. to determine whether this
was also the case for nsclc, we analyzed  xxxg791xxx  expression
levels in 12 nsclc cell lines using rt-pcr. three of these
cell lines h1299, a549 and h520, showed  xxxg791xxx  overexpression compared to h3122, which was confirmed using
western blot analysis (fig. 2a). h520 is a squamous cell line
that carries  xxxg791xxx  amplification (18). h1299 and a549 (both

h3122 (adenocarcinoma,  xxxg700xxx -alk translocation). the  xxxg791xxx  transcription level of h3122 was set as 1 and  xxxg53xxx  ( xxxg53xxx ) was used as loading control.

fusion positive) do not carry  xxxg791xxx  amplification or mutations
(cancer cell line encyclopedia, http://www.broadinstitute.org/
ccle/home). these cell lines were used to determine whether
 xxxd2985xxx  affects cell growth using a range of concentrations.
 xxxd2985xxx  showed no effect on the growth of h3122 cells which
express low levels of  xxxg791xxx  when used at concentrations up
to 1000 nm (fig. 2b). in contrast, the three cell lines overexpressing  xxxg791xxx  showed a dramatic reduction in cell growth
rate at various concentrations, ranging from 200 to 1000 nm.
we further used a colony formation assay to evaluate the effect
of  xxxd2985xxx  treatment. similar to the cell proliferation effects,
 xxxd2985xxx  significantly inhibited colony formation in cells overexpressing  xxxg791xxx  but not in h3122 cells which express low
levels of  xxxg791xxx  (fig. 2c).

having
shown that  xxxd2985xxx  inhibits cell growth of nsclc cells
overexpressing  xxxg791xxx , we then determined whether this
cell growth inhibition is associated with decreased levels of
phospho- xxxg791xxx .  xxxd2985xxx  dramatically decreased the tyrosine phosphorylation levels in all three cell lines expressing
 xxxg791xxx  (fig. 3a). western blot analyses with phospho-specific
antibodies showed that  xxxd2985xxx  treatment also led to inactivation of several direct targets of  xxxg791xxx , such as src and
plcgamma (fig. 3b). since  xxxd2985xxx  directly inhibits src activation (10), the level of phospho-src in h3122 was also diminished
(fig. 3a). inactivation of src, however, did not lead to growth

inhibition of the h3122 cells (fig. 2b). consistently, immunocytochemical analysis using a specific anti-phospho- xxxg791xxx 
antibody further confirmed that  xxxd2985xxx  (1.0 µm) effectively
reduced the membrane phospho- xxxg791xxx  staining levels in both
h1299 and a549 cells (fig. 3b) after only 1 h. in parallel with
these analyses, we also determined whether downregulation
of  xxxg791xxx  activation could lead to cell cycle arrest or/and cell
apoptosis.  xxxd2985xxx  markedly inhibited the cell cycle in these
 xxxg791xxx -positive cells but not in  xxxg791xxx -negative h3122 cells
(fig. 3c). no dramatic increase in the apoptotic cell population was noted in the  xxxd2985xxx -treated group (data not shown).
to further investigate whether cell growth inhibition is related
to inactivation of  xxxg791xxx  kinase by ponotinib, we treated the
h520 and h1581 cells with  xxxd2985xxx  in step-wise increasing
doses. the h1581 cell line has been shown to overexpress
 xxxg791xxx  (18),  xxxg792xxx  and  xxxg794xxx  (fig. 6). the h520 cells,
however, mainly overexpress  xxxg791xxx  with only low levels of
 xxxg792xxx -4 compared with the h1581 cells. other nsclc cell
lines showed a similar expression pattern as the h520 cell
line (fig. 6). immunoblotting, with the anti-phospho- xxxg791xxx 
antibody, demonstrated that the  xxxg791xxx  activity in the h1581
cells was inhibited by a lower dose of  xxxd2985xxx  than that used
for the h520 cell line (fig. 3d). consistently, the cell proliferation assay showed that the h1581 cells were more sensitive to
 xxxd2985xxx  when compared with the h520 cells. the ic50 values
for the h1581 and h520 cells were 30 and 50 nm, respectively
(fig. 3e). collectively, these data suggest that cell growth
inhibition by  xxxd2985xxx  correlates with inhibition of  xxxg791xxx 
activation.

four nsclc cell lines using the anti-py654 antibody demonstrated that  xxxd2985xxx  treatment (1.0 µm) led to reduced levels of phospho- xxxg791xxx  while it did
not affect total  xxxg791xxx . inhibition of  xxxg791xxx  activation by  xxxd2985xxx  (1.0 µm) also resulted in reduced activation of the  xxxg791xxx  downstream effectors src
and plcgamma. (b) immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the density of membrane-bound phospho- xxxg791xxx  staining (y653/654, arrows) was reduced by
 xxxd2985xxx  treatment at 1.0 µm. (c)  xxxd2985xxx  caused accumulation of cells in the g1 phase in nsclc cells overexpressing  xxxg791xxx . (d) western blot analysis

 xxxd2985xxx  was
designed to act against bcr-abl kinase and its mutants, but
it also effectively inhibits  xxxg791xxx , src, vegfr, pdgfr and
kit (10). to determine whether the growth inhibition noted in
the three nsclc cell lines was the direct result of inactivation of  xxxg791xxx , we used shrnas to specifically knockdown
 xxxg791xxx  expression in these cells. shgfp was used as a negative control. seventy-two hours post transfection, cells from
independently transfected wells were pooled for analysis. the
pooled cells were coincidently analyzed for  xxxg791xxx  expression,
activation, cell cycle analysis and cell proliferation. real-time
rt-pcr analysis showed that shfgfr1 markedly decreased
the transcription levels of  xxxg791xxx  in all three nsclc cell
lines compared with the vector control carrying shgfp. the
 xxxg791xxx -negative h3122 cells showed no alterations in expression as predicted (fig. 4a). consistently, western blotting with
an anti- xxxg791xxx  antibody also showed the effect of the knockdown in the shfgfr1 but not in the shgfp-infected cells
(fig. 4b). to determine whether knockdown of  xxxg791xxx  can
decrease cell proliferation, we performed a standard cell cycle
analysis which showed that knockdown of  xxxg791xxx  dramatically decreased the percentage of s/g2 phase cells compared
with that in the shgfp-infected cells (fig. 4c). consistent
with the cell cycle analysis, cell proliferation assay showed
that shfgfr1 transduction significantly induced cell growth
inhibition in the  xxxg791xxx -positive nsclc cells compared
with that in the shgfp-infected cells. we did not observe any
differences between the two groups in the  xxxg791xxx -negative
h3122 cells (fig. 4d).

to investigate whether  xxxd2985xxx  can decrease
the growth of primary lung cancer cells, we seeded freshly
resected human non-small cell lung cancers into culture from
12 patients. two of these cultures were successfully established and assayed. one was derived from a squamous-cell
carcinoma (pt #8) and another was from an adenocarcinoma
(pt #9) based on their histological features (fig. 5a, left panel).
these two primary lung cancer cell cultures were routinely
grown in rpmi-1640 medium plus 10% fbs without addition
of any growth factors. in the absence of  xxxd2985xxx  these cells
overexpressed many oncogenes frequently upregulated in
cancer e.g. plk1, survivin and  xxxg1988xxx , compared to normal lung
tissue (data not shown). western blot analysis with  xxxg791xxx 
antibodies showed high levels of expression of  xxxg791xxx  in
these two tumor cell cultures compared to normal lung tissues
and hbe4 cells (an immortalized human bronchial epithelial
cell line) (fig. 5a, right panel). consistently, both primary
cell cultures were sensitive to  xxxd2985xxx  treatment and showed
a dramatic reduction in the cell growth rate at various ic50
values, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 µm (fig. 5b). further analysis
suggested that this cell growth inhibition was associated
with a decrease in phospho- xxxg791xxx  levels in the presence of
 xxxd2985xxx  (fig. 5a, right bottom panel). to confirm the cell
proliferation effect of  xxxd2985xxx , we also performed colony
formation assays, which demonstrated that  xxxd2985xxx  significantly inhibited colony formation of both primary lung cancer
cell cultures (fig. 5c). subsequently, cell cycle analysis, in
combination with brdu uptake, showed that the percentage
of cells in the s phase was dramatically decreased. apoptotic

discussion
cancer is driven by different types of genetic mutations acquired
during tumorigenesis and tumor growth (19). identifying these
mutations that are critical for tumor growth (oncogenic drivers)
is the first step. once the oncogenic drivers are identified, they
can then be targeted accordingly. this therapeutic strategy
is becoming increasingly more possible due to advances in
second generation sequencing technology and other profiling
platforms (20) which facilitate the identification of driver mutations together with the increasing availability of drugs that
target these molecular changes (21). to date, egfr (22,23),
kras (24),  xxxg700xxx -alk (25),  xxxg1973xxx  (26,27), ret (28,29),
erbb2 and  xxxg1745xxx  (30) and met (31), among others, are
found to drive tumorigenesis in varying proportions of nsclc,
mostly adenocarcinomas. targeted therapies have materialized
in these tumors carrying egfr,  xxxg700xxx -alk,  xxxg1973xxx  as well as
ret. in the case of  xxxg791xxx , however, there is no mutation(s)
or translocation found to be involved, to date. instead, copy
number increase appears to be responsible for the activation of
this pathway particularly in the squamous cell subtype (18,32).
other important mechanisms for over-activation of  xxxg791xxx 
may be caused by increasing availability of  xxxg791xxx  through
increased transcription and/or autocrine/paracrine mechanisms

as part of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (emt) (33).
in the present study, we showed that ~50% (30 out of 59) of
the nsclc patients overexpressed  xxxg791xxx , a percentage that is
much higher than that of  xxxg791xxx  amplification. together these
studies indicate that i) copy number increase of  xxxg791xxx  contributes to the overexpression of  xxxg791xxx  in these tumor cells and
ii) overexpression of  xxxg791xxx  in a proportion of patients is due
to transcriptional upregulation of  xxxg791xxx . given that aberrant
fgfr pathway activation is also involved in drug resistance (34),
fgfr targeting is an important strategy in containing cancer
growth and possibly in overcoming resistance. importantly, in
two previous studies, while the  xxxg791xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2857xxx  was
shown to be effective against cells with overactivated  xxxg791xxx ,
this was not uniformly effective suggesting other mutation(s)
may affect sensitivity to  xxxd2857xxx .
in the present study, we demonstrated that targeting the
 xxxg791xxx  signaling pathway using a novel  xxxg791xxx  inhibitor in
nsclc cell lines as well as primary nsclc samples overexpressing  xxxg791xxx  significantly inhibited cancer cell growth
and clonogenicity, suggesting the potential clinical benefit of
 xxxd2985xxx . it is noteworthy that two nsclc cell lines, h1581
and h520, both harboring the  xxxg791xxx  gene amplification
[4 copies (18)], have much higher levels of  xxxg791xxx  transcription than other cell lines (figs. 2a). consequently these two
cell lines were more sensitive to  xxxd2985xxx  (fig. 3d and e;
ic50 <50 nm), confirming the results from a recent study (35).
at the recommended clinical trial dose of 45 mg, the trough
level of  xxxd2985xxx  reached 40 nm. the peak level was several

figure 5.  xxxd2985xxx  treatment effectively inhibits human primary lung cancer cell culture growth. (a) histological studies of two primary lung cancer tissues
(left panel) and western blot analysis (right panel) showed high expression of  xxxg791xxx  in the two primary lung cancer tissues when compared with a normal
human lung tissue and hbe4 immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells (right top panel). the phospho- xxxg791xxx  levels in the primary lung cell cultures
were significantly reduced following  xxxd2985xxx  treatment at 1.0 µm (right bottom panel). (b) cell proliferation assays showed that  xxxd2985xxx  inhibited the
growth of the primary lung cell cultures at various concentrations. error bars refer to the sd of octuplicate analyses. (c) clonogenic assay showed that the
number of colonies was decreased in the presence of  xxxd2985xxx  at 1.0 µm. (d) brdu cell cycle analysis showed a decrease in the percentage of cells in the s
phase following treatment with 1.0 µm  xxxd2985xxx . all experiments were performed at least in duplicate.

measurements.

fold higher (35). this suggests that  xxxd2985xxx  at a clinically
achievable concentration markedly reduces the growth of
nsclc in which  xxxg791xxx  is amplified. however, further
studies in animal models are necessary in order to determine
the efficacy before clinical trials are initiated in lung cancer
patients whose tumors overexpress  xxxg791xxx .

it is noteworthy that an increasing number of studies
have demonstrated that overexpression of  xxxg791xxx  is not only
observed in nsclc, but also in other types of cancers, such
as breast cancer (36-38), prostate cancer (39,40) and ovarian
cancer (41). recent large scale analyses of somatic copynumber alterations from 3,131 cancer specimens, spanning

oncology reports 29: 2181-2190, 2013

26 different cancer types, found amplification of the  xxxg791xxx 
gene in 10% of cases. this is the most significantly reported
focal amplification (42), indicating that  xxxg791xxx  signaling is
commonly involved in tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression and may represent a promising therapeutic target in many
cancer types. the precise role of  xxxg791xxx  signaling in the
pathogenesis and progression of these tumors, however, is still
unclear. in rearranged  xxxg791xxx  fusion kinase-induced leukemia
and lymphoma, we and others (17,43) have demonstrated
that constitutive activation of the chimeric  xxxg791xxx  kinase
alone is not sufficient to cause overt leukemia/lymphoma
development in mouse models. using immunohistochemical
staining, behrens et al (4) studied 321 nsclc tissue samples
and 426 adjacent bronchial epithelial specimens, and found a
significant increase in  xxxg787xxx  and fgfr proteins in respiratory epithelium with squamous dysplasia, compared with
metaplastic bronchial epithelia. using snp array analysis,
dutt et al (32) also observed that 60% (11 out of 19) of primary
nsclc patients were in stage i. together these observations
suggest that the activation of the fgfr signaling pathway is
an early event in the pathogenesis of nsclc. if so, fgfr
inhibitors may prove to be effective against early stage tumors.
in summary, our study provides convincing evidence that
abnormal expression of  xxxg791xxx  occurs in almost 50% of all
nsclc patients presented with both major histological types.
 xxxg791xxx , therefore, may serve as a novel target in molecularly
targeted therapies against lung cancer. targeting  xxxg791xxx 
kinases with the novel  xxxg791xxx  inhibitor  xxxd2985xxx  is a potentially successful approach for the treatment of nsclc patients
carrying aberrant activation of  xxxg791xxx . it is conceivable that
 xxxd2985xxx  may be used where appropriate either alone or in
combination with other drugs in the future.
