abstract
 xxxd3521xxx  ( xxxd3521xxx ) is an essential fat-soluble nutrient with antioxidant properties.  xxxd3521xxx  transfer protein (alpha-ttp), the product of the gene
responsible for familial isolated  xxxd3521xxx  deficiency, plays an important role in maintaining the plasma  xxxd3521xxx  level by mediating the secretion of
 xxxd3521xxx  by the liver. however, the mechanisms underlying hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion are not fully understood. this study was undertaken to
elucidate the mechanism of  xxxd3521xxx  re-efflux from hepatocytes, the cells that have the most important role in regulating plasma- xxxd3521xxx 
concentrations. from in vitro experiments using [3h]alpha- xxxd3389xxx  and mcarh7777 cells that stably express  xxxd3521xxx  transfer protein (alpha-ttp), the
following results were obtained. first, addition of  xxxg173xxx  ( xxxg173xxx ), a direct acceptor of the  xxxg9xxx  ( xxxg9xxx )-secreted
lipids, increased  xxxd3521xxx  secretion in a dose-dependent manner. second,  xxxd3014xxx , an antiatherogenic compound reported to be an inactivator of  xxxg9xxx 
reduced hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion. third,  xxxg9xxx -rnai suppressed hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion. in a mouse in vivo experiment, addition of
1%  xxxd3014xxx  to the diet decreased plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations. these results strongly suggest that  xxxg9xxx  is substantially involved in hepatic
 xxxd3521xxx  secretion.

1. introduction
 xxxd3521xxx  is a major lipid-soluble, chain-breaking antioxidant in
the body. its main role is to protect the integrity of membranes by
inhibiting lipid peroxidation.  xxxd3521xxx  is the generic term for a group
of four tocopherols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) and four tocotrienols (alpha, beta, gamma, delta).
among the eight forms,  xxxd3521xxx  is biologically most active and is
selectively retained in the body [1]. despite the vital physiological
requirement for  xxxd3521xxx , our understanding of the mechanisms that
regulate its levels in the body is limited. current knowledge of
intestinal  xxxd3521xxx  absorption is based on human and animal studies
involving oral or intraduodenal administration of  xxxd3521xxx  followed
by lymph and plasma analysis [2–7]. in most studies, around 20–50%
of dietary  xxxd3521xxx  is believed to be absorbed [8]. intestinal

absorption of  xxxd3521xxx  requires the presence of bile acids. vitamin
e is absorbed by enterocytes and then is secreted in the form of
chylomicrons into the lymphatic system. anwar et al. [9] reported that
 xxxd3521xxx  taken up by caco-2 cells is secreted with chylomicrons and
high-density lipoprotein (hdl). chylomicrons containing  xxxd3521xxx 
are secreted into the intestinal lymphatic system and are transported
into the systemic circulation via the thoracic duct.  xxxd3521xxx  reaching
the plasma via chylomicrons is partly released during the hydrolysis of
these particles by  xxxg1337xxx  [10]. lipase-mediated hydrolysis
of lipoprotein is needed for the uptake of  xxxd3521xxx  by peripheral cells.
however, most of the  xxxd3521xxx  that reaches the liver is in the form of
chylomicron remnants. chylomicron remnants are taken up by
endocytosis mainly in the liver, but probably also by several
extrahepatic tissues. once in the liver, the various isoforms of vitamin
e undergo different metabolic fates. the cytosolic  xxxd3521xxx 
transfer protein (alpha-ttp), a 31-kda member of the sec14 protein
family, selectively binds  xxxd3521xxx , whereas the other isoforms are
metabolized by microsomal p450 [11,12] or excreted into the bile. a
genetic defect in alpha-ttp is responsible for inducing a severe  xxxd3521xxx 
deficiency characterized by a neurodegenerative disease, ataxia with

452

 xxxd3521xxx  deficiency [13,14]. alpha-ttp thus plays an essential role in
maintaining plasma and tissue concentrations of  xxxd3521xxx . the
exact mechanism by which alpha-ttp regulates intracellular trafficking
as well as secretion of  xxxd3521xxx  into the plasma and very low
density lipoprotein (vldl) particles is not fully understood. one
hypothesis is that alpha-ttp facilitates vldl-associated  xxxd3521xxx 
secretion through a golgi-mediated pathway. however, we reported
that brefeldin a, which effectively inhibits vldl secretion by
disrupting the golgi apparatus, had no effect on  xxxd3521xxx 
secretion [15]. this result indicates that alpha-ttp-mediated  xxxd3521xxx  secretion is not coupled to vldl secretion. qian et al. [16] also
confirmed that  xxxd3521xxx  is secreted by hepatoma cells by a non-golgi
alpha-ttp-mediated pathway. they showed that  xxxd3521xxx  arrives at
intracellular vesicular organelles where it co-localizes with alpha-ttp and
a marker of the lysosomal compartment ( xxxg1300xxx ) before being
transported to the plasma membrane in an alpha-ttp-dependent manner
and that  xxxd3521xxx  secretion from the hepatocytes is inhibited by
 xxxd2215xxx , an inhibitor of several abc transporters. oram et al. [17]
reported that efflux of  xxxd3521xxx  from cells to hdl apolipoproteins
is mediated by  xxxg9xxx . however, none of the cell types they used
(murine raw264 macrophages,  xxxg9xxx  fibroblast and baby
hamster kidney cells) were hepatocytes [17].  xxxg9xxx  initiates the
formation of mature hdl by facilitating  xxxg173xxx  ( xxxg173xxx )
lipidation. mutations in the gene encoding  xxxg9xxx  have been reported
in  xxxg9xxx , an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
almost complete absence of plasma hdl, deposition of cholesteryl
esters in the reticuloendothelial system and aberrant cellular lipid
trafficking [18–20]. mice lacking a functional  xxxg9xxx  also have severe
deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins including  xxxd3521xxx  [21]. however,
in order to better understand the regulation of plasma  xxxd3521xxx 
concentration, it is necessary to determine whether  xxxg9xxx  is involved
in hepatic alpha-ttp-mediated  xxxd3521xxx  secretion. in this study,
we obtained direct evidence that  xxxg9xxx  is involved in the secretion of
 xxxd3521xxx  from hepatocytes.
2. materials and methods
2.1. materials
mcarh7777 cells were purchased from american type culture collection
(manassas, va, usa). mca-ttp21 cells, namely, alpha-ttp-stable transformants of
mcarh7777 cells, were constructed previously [15]. [3h]alpha- xxxd3389xxx  was
purchased from amersham. fetal calf serum and horse serum were purchased from jrh
biosciences (lenexa, ks, usa). penicillin, streptomycin sulfate and l-glutamine were
purchased from gibco (gaithersburg, md, usa). human  xxxg1335xxx -1 was purchased from
calbiochem (la jolla, ca, usa). phosphatidylcholine (egg) and dioleoyl-phosphatidylserine were purchased from avanti (alabaster, al, usa). dicethylphosphate,
cholesterol and bovine  xxxg124xxx  were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo,
usa). silica gel 60 tlc plate was purchased from merck (darmstadt, germany).
 xxxd3014xxx  was purchased from wako (osaka, japan). adenoviral vectors, padeasy-1 and
pshuttle-cmv were purchased from qbiogene (carlsbad, ca, usa). the sirna
expression vector, pigene-trna-pur, was purchased from igene (ibaraki, japan).

2.2. animals and diets
male 6-week-old c57bl/6cr mice were purchased from japan slc (hamamatsu,
japan). they were maintained under controlled conditions (temperature, 24±1°c;
humidity, 55±5%) in plastic cages with sterilized paper for bedding. the animals were
divided into the following two groups: (1) control feeding group (n=4) and (2) 1%
 xxxd3014xxx  treatment group (n=4). the control diet was made by mixing 20 mg
 xxxd3521xxx  into 1 kg of  xxxd3521xxx -deficient diet. the 1%  xxxd3014xxx  diet was made by
adding 1% v/w  xxxd3014xxx  to the control diet. the institutional animal care and use
committee approved these studies.

2.3. sampling
both the control feeding group and the  xxxd3014xxx  treatment group received control
diets for 2 weeks before the beginning of the experiments. they then received each
diet for 4 weeks. blood samples were collected after 6 h of fasting at the following
three time points, namely, 0, 14 and 28 days after initiation of experimental diet

feeding. plasma total cholesterol of each sample was measured by using the cholesterol
e test (wako).
2.4. detection of  xxxd3521xxx 
plasma  xxxd3521xxx  was extracted by chloroform/methanol (2/1, by volume).
lipids and  xxxd3521xxx  were extracted by centrifugation (15,000 rpm, at 4°c for 5 min)
after mixing vigorously with a vortex mixer. concentrations of  xxxd3521xxx  were
detected using an hplc system with an electrochemical detector (nanospace si-1,
shiseido, tokyo, japan). a wakosil-2 5c18 rs column (wako) was used with an eluent
of methanol/naclo4 containing 50 mm naclo4 at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. the
concentration of  xxxd3521xxx  was calculated by comparing the area under the curve
with that of the standard.
2.5. cell cultures
the rat hepatoma cell line mcarh7777 cells were grown in dulbecco's modified
eagle's medium with 2 mg/ml bsa containing 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 mug/ml
streptomycin sulfate and 2 mm l-glutamine. mca-ttp21 cells were cultured in the
same fashion as mcarh7777 cells, as previously described [15].
2.6. shrna sequence against rat- xxxg9xxx  mrna
the shrna sequence against rat- xxxg9xxx  mrna-specific sequences (genbank
accession number nm_178095) was designed. this oligonucleotide encodes an sirna
sense strand, loop (5′-cttcctgtc-3′) and an sirna antisense strand. custom oligonucleotides were synthesized as below: a template of stem loop: 5′-agatgtcctatctctgttatgttgatgatacttcctgtcatgtcatcaacataacaggggtagggcatctggtaccatagatatcttttttt-3′; forward primer: 5′-ccaactttgagctcagatgtcctatctctgttat-3′;
and the reverse primer: 5′-aaaaaaagatatctatggtacc-3′.
2.7. preparation of vectors and insertion of dna for making the adenovirus expressing
shrna against rat- xxxg9xxx 
to knock down endogenous  xxxg9xxx  protein in mca-ttp21 cells, we constructed an
adenovirus expressing shrna against rat- xxxg9xxx  (adv-rabca1-rnai). we first inserted
shrna against rat- xxxg9xxx  at multiple cloning sites downstream the trnaval promoter, a
promoter to express the valine transfer rna, of the pigene-trna-pur vector (igene,
ibaraki, japan). with this vector, the shrna fragment is transcribed by rna polymerase
iii and connected to the trna.
to prepare the dna insert (sense-loop-antisense) for shrna, the insert was
amplified by pcr using the templates and primers as described in section 2.6. the
resulting double-stranded dna was inserted into the pigene-trna-pur.
to check the rnai effect of this vector, we co-transfected hek293cells with 1000 ng
of this vector and 100 ng of pcdna3 containing rat- xxxg9xxx . after we confirmed that this
vector can reduce the expression of  xxxg9xxx  to 15% compared to hek293 cells
transfected with pcdna3 containing rat- xxxg9xxx  only (data not shown), we inserted
the sequence from the trna (val) promoter to the t7 terminator of this vector into
pshuttle-cmv. pshuttle-cmv is a transfer vector containing a multiple cloning site in
which a cloned gene is under the control of the human cmv promoter for constructive
recombinant expression in a wide variety of cell line. the pshuttle-cmv containing the
sequence of shrna against rat- xxxg9xxx  and an adenovirus expression vector padeasy-1
were electroporated into e. coli bj5183. recombinant adenoviral constructs were
transfected into e1-transformed hek293 cells to produce viral particles. the
recombinant adenoviruses were purified by using virakit adenomini-4.
2.8. transduction of adenoviral vectors into cells
cultured mcarh7777 cells and mca-ttp21 cells at 70% confluence were infected
with the respective adenoviruses in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium containing 2%
fbs for 2 h. cells were infected with the adv-rabca1-rnai (rat- xxxg9xxx -rnai
adenoviruses) at a rate of 10,000 particles per cell. as controls, cells were infected
with the lacz adenoviruses (adv-lacz) at the same rate. the cultures were
supplemented with an equal volume of dulbecco's modified eagle's medium containing 20% fbs and incubated for an additional 4 days.
2.9. preparation of cell membrane and western blot analysis of  xxxg9xxx  protein
cells were harvested in set buffer containing 1% protease inhibitor cocktails
(sigma) and homogenized. the cell suspension was centrifuged at 1000×g for
10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000×g for 1 h to prepare
the membrane fraction as a pellet. the proteins were separated by sds-page
(7%) and analyzed by immunoblotting using the anti- xxxg9xxx  monoclonal antibody
km3110 [22].
2.10. preparation of liposomes
multilamellar liposomes were prepared as described previously [15]. the liposomes
were composed of pc/ps/dcp/cholesterol/[3h]alpha- xxxd3389xxx  (5 muci/nmol)

3. results
3.1.  xxxg173xxx  increases hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion in a
dose-dependent manner
to examine the secretion of  xxxd3521xxx  from cultured hepatocytes, we used radiolabeled alpha- xxxd3389xxx  (fig. 1a), which is
assumed to be hydrolyzed to generate  xxxd3521xxx  when entering
cells. the  xxxd3521xxx  is secreted into the medium by the action
of alpha-ttp. thus, it should be possible to evaluate the secretion of
 xxxd3521xxx  from cells by measuring the amount of  xxxd3521xxx  in
the cells and in the medium [15,16].

(b) mcarh7777 cells and mca-ttp21 cells were radiolabeled with [3h]alpha-tocopheryl
acetate, incubated for 24 h with medium containing 2 mg/ml bsa plus 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and
20 mug/ml  xxxg173xxx , respectively. we measured the amount of [3h] xxxd3521xxx  in cells
(white) and medium (black). data represent means±s.d. of triplicates expressed as
percent of  xxxd3521xxx  secretion as described in the materials and methods section.

(molar ratio 50:50:10:75:2). the mixture of these lipids was dried under a stream of
nitrogen, and dried lipids were resuspended and sonicated in 0.3 m glucose at room
temperature.

2.11. incubation of cells with radiolabeled lipids
cells were plated at a density of 1×105 cells per well into 24-well collagen-coated
plates. the medium was changed to dmem containing 2 mg/ml bsa and 10 mug/ml apoai after overnight incubation. following 6 h of incubation, the medium was removed, and
cells were incubated for 24 h at 37°c in 0.5 ml medium with [3h]alpha-tocopheryl acetatecontaining liposomes (5 muci per well).  xxxd3521xxx  secretion (%) was calculated as
follows:  xxxd3521xxx  secretion ratio (%)={[3h] xxxd3521xxx  in medium/([3h]alphatocopherol in the cells+[3h] xxxd3521xxx  in medium)}×100 (%).

2.12. lipid extraction and analysis by thin-layer chromatography
after incubation, extracellular and cellular lipids were extracted by hexane. cells
were washed twice with pbs and were lysed by adding 0.1 ml of 0.1% sds. an aliquot
was diluted with 0.4 ml of aqua dest and used for the following procedure. the
media were centrifuged briefly (3500 rpm, 5 min, 4°c). the cell lysate or medium
(0.5 ml) was added to 1 ml of 6% pyrogallol in ethanol. the mixture was diluted
with 1.5 ml of 65% ethanol. three milliliters of hexane was added and the mixture
was mixed vigorously in a vortex mixer before being centrifuged at room
temperature. the hexane layer was saved, and the hexane extracts were evaporated
under nitrogen. the residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and subjected to thinlayer chromatography on a silica gel plate. the plate was developed with chcl3. after
development, plates were exposed and analyzed, using a bio-image analyzer (fujifilm,
tokyo, japan).

 xxxg173xxx . we found that the amounts of endogenous  xxxg173xxx  secreted
from mcarh7777 and mca-ttp21 cells were negligible compared
with the amount of added  xxxg173xxx  (data not shown) under the present
conditions, indicating that endogenous  xxxg173xxx  secreted from cells
does not contribute to the secretion of  xxxd3521xxx . bsa (2 mg/ml)
added to the culture (see materials and methods) might serve as an
acceptor of  xxxd3521xxx  secreted from the cells in the absence of
exogenous  xxxg173xxx .
3.2.  xxxd3014xxx  inhibits hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion
 xxxd3014xxx  (fig. 2a) has been clinically used as an antiatherogenic
compound, not only because of its lipid-lowering effect but also
because of its ability to prevent atherogenic oxidation of low-density
lipoprotein (ldl) as has been shown in in vitro [23,24] and in vivo
models [25]. wu et al. [26] as well as favari et al. [27] reported that
 xxxd3014xxx  inactivates  xxxg9xxx  by inhibiting the binding of  xxxg173xxx  to the
cells in a dose-dependent manner and by reducing the cellular lipid
release. in this study,  xxxd3521xxx  secretion from mcarh7777 and
mca-ttp21 cells was inhibited by a treatment with 10 and 20 mum
 xxxd3014xxx  (fig. 2b).  xxxg9xxx  proteins in  xxxd3014xxx -treated mcarh7777
and mca-ttp21 cells showed an approximately 1.2-fold increase
(fig. 2c and d). wu et al. [26] also reported that  xxxd3014xxx  does not
affect  xxxg9xxx  mrna levels but indeed leads to an increase in  xxxg9xxx 
protein levels. they argued that  xxxd3014xxx  inhibits the proteolytic
degradation of  xxxg9xxx  by calpain. our results show that  xxxd3014xxx 
does not decrease the  xxxg9xxx  protein level but reduces hepatic alphatocopherol secretion.  xxxd3014xxx  did not decrease the level of alpha-ttp
protein either (data not shown).

mca-ttp21 cells. (a) expression of  xxxg9xxx  in mca-ttp21 cells which were infected
with rat- xxxg9xxx -rnai adenoviruses (adv-rabca1-rnai). cells were infected with advrabca1-rnai at a rate of 10,000 particles/cell. as controls, cells were infected with
adv-lacz at the same rate. the cultures were incubated for 4 days as described in
materials and methods. after 4 days of incubation, cells were harvested and
homogenized. seven micrograms of the membrane protein was analyzed by
immunoblotting for  xxxg9xxx  protein. immunoblot of tfr served as a loading control.
(b) quantification of the rat  xxxg9xxx  protein in mca-ttp21 cells by densitometric
analysis of the scanned images. data represent means±s.d. ⁎pb.01, compared with
adv-lacz-infected control (unpaired t test). (c) mcarh7777 and mca-ttp21 cells were
infected with 10,000 particles/cell of control adv-lacz or adv-rabca1-rnai. after 3
days of incubation with each virus, adv-lacz-infected mca-ttp21 cells were
radiolabeled with [3h]alpha- xxxd3389xxx , incubated for 24 h with medium containing 2 mg/ml bsa with/without 10 mug/ml  xxxg173xxx . adv-rabca1-rnai-infected mcattp21 cells were radiolabeled with [3h]alpha- xxxd3389xxx , incubated for 24 h with
medium containing 2 mg/ml bsa and 10 mug/ml  xxxg173xxx . after another 24 h of incubation,
the radioactivity of [3h] xxxd3521xxx  in cells (white) and medium (black) was
measured. data represent means±s.d. ⁎pb.005, ⁎⁎pb.025 (anova, tukey).

in this study, we used the rat hepatoma cell line mcarh7777.
because the alpha-ttp expression level in mcarh7777 cells is extremely
low, we established an alpha-ttp stable transformant mcarh7777 cell
(the mca-ttp21 cell) [15]. we reported previously that the level of
 xxxd3521xxx  secretion from mca-ttp21 cells is significantly higher
than that from mcarh7777 cells [15].
previous studies showed that lipid-free  xxxg173xxx  increases alphatocopherol secretion from cultured nonhepatic cells [17]. to confirm
the participation of  xxxg9xxx  in hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion, we
tested the ability of  xxxg173xxx  to remove radiolabeled  xxxd3521xxx  from
mcarh7777 and mca-ttp21 cells (fig. 1b). in both mcarh7777 and
mca-ttp21 cells,  xxxd3521xxx  secretion was increased by addition of
 xxxg173xxx  in a dose-dependent manner. moreover,  xxxd3521xxx  secretion from mca-ttp21 cells was significantly higher than that from
mcarh7777 cells at any  xxxg173xxx  concentration. we observed small but
appreciable amounts of  xxxd3521xxx  secretion from both
mcarh7777 and mca-ttp21 cells even in the absence of exogenous

3.3. effect of rnai of  xxxg9xxx  on hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion
we attempted to knock down endogenous  xxxg9xxx  protein in mcattp21 cells (fig. 3a and b). we constructed an adenovirus expressing
shrna against rat- xxxg9xxx  (adv-rabca1-rnai) and infected it into
mca-ttp21 cells (see section 2.7). based on immunoblotting,  xxxg9xxx 
expression levels in adv-rabca1-rnai-infected mca-ttp21 cells
were only 35% of the levels in control adv-lacz-infected mca-ttp21
cells (fig. 3b). we measured the amount of radiolabeled  xxxd3521xxx 
in the cells and medium.
we assumed that the  xxxg173xxx -dependent increase in  xxxd3521xxx 
secretion equals the value obtained by subtracting the value of
 xxxd3521xxx  secretion in the absence of  xxxg173xxx  (∼40%, left bar in
fig. 3c) from that of  xxxd3521xxx  secretion in adv-lacz-infected mcattp21 cells treated with  xxxg173xxx  (∼72%, central bar in fig. 3c). the
 xxxg173xxx -dependent increase in  xxxd3521xxx  secretion was significantly lowered by  xxxg9xxx -rnai (∼50%, right bar), indicating that
 xxxg9xxx  participates in the transport of  xxxd3521xxx . while the  xxxg1335xxx -iindependent  xxxd3521xxx  secretion from mca-ttp21 cells was 10%
(fig. 1b), the  xxxg173xxx -independent  xxxd3521xxx  secretion from advlacz-infected mca-ttp21 cells increased up to 40% (fig. 3c). it is likely
that incubation with the adenovirus over 4 days increased alphatocopherol leakage from these cells. at present, we have no
explanation for these results, but similar results were obtained in
every experiment. because the  xxxg173xxx -independent  xxxd3521xxx 
secretion from adv-lacz-infected mca-ttp21 cells was not decreased
by  xxxg9xxx  depletion (data not shown), other machineries such as
membrane particles shed off from the cells may serve as an acceptor
for  xxxd3521xxx  efflux in these cells.

furthermore, we investigated whether  xxxd3014xxx  can decrease
murine plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentration. male mice were fed with
a 1% (v/w)  xxxd3014xxx  or control diet for 4 weeks. compared with

fig. 4.  xxxd3014xxx  reduces the  xxxd3521xxx  and cholesterol concentration in murine
plasma. (a) male 6-week-old c57bl/6cr mice were divided into the following two
groups: (1) control feeding group (n=4) and (2) 1% v/w  xxxd3014xxx  treatment group
(n=4). blood samples were collected after 6 h of fasting at the following three time
points: 0, 14 and 28 days after they were fed each diet. plasma  xxxd3521xxx  was
extracted by chloroform/methanol. concentrations of  xxxd3521xxx  were detected
using an hplc system. data represent means±s.d. ⁎pb.025, ⁎⁎pb.01, compared with
day 0 (paired t test). (b) plasma concentrations of total cholesterol on days 0, 14 and
28 were measured. data represent means±s.d. ⁎⁎⁎pb.0025, compared with day 0
(paired t test). (c) comparison of the concentration of  xxxd3521xxx  and total

⁎pb.05 (anova, tukey).

plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations prior to  xxxd3014xxx  treatment,
plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations were significantly reduced after
2 and 4 weeks of  xxxd3014xxx  treatment (fig. 4a). notably, the probucolinduced reduction of plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations was
significantly larger than the reduction of plasma total cholesterol
concentrations after 2 weeks of treatment with  xxxd3014xxx  (fig. 4b and
c). these results suggested that  xxxd3014xxx  inhibited  xxxg9xxx  and
directly reduced plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations in an in vivo
model. the reduction of plasma  xxxd3521xxx  can therefore be
regarded as a direct effect of  xxxg9xxx  inhibition and not merely as a
secondary effect due to the reduction of plasma lipoproteins, a major
reservoir of plasma  xxxd3521xxx .
4. discussion
the present study using both in vitro and in vivo studies showed
that  xxxg9xxx  is substantially involved in hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion. three lines of evidence support this conclusion. first,  xxxg173xxx ,
a direct acceptor for  xxxg9xxx -secreted lipids, increased  xxxd3521xxx 

455

secretion from cultured hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner.
second,  xxxd3014xxx , an inactivator of  xxxg9xxx  via inhibition of cellular
 xxxg173xxx  binding, inhibited  xxxd3521xxx  secretion from hepatocytes
and decreased murine plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations. third,
 xxxg9xxx -rnai suppressed hepatic  xxxd3521xxx  secretion.
orso et al. [21] reported that  xxxg9xxx (−/−) mice are deficient in fatsoluble vitamins such as vitamins a, e and k1, but they did not determine whether this was due to a secondary effect of the decreased
plasma lipoprotein levels or the reduction of  xxxg9xxx -mediated
secretion of these vitamins. on the other hand, elinder et al. [28]
found that treatment of hypercholesterolemic patients (n=303) with
 xxxd3014xxx  for 3 years reduced serum  xxxd3521xxx  by 14%. bird et al. [29]
reported that 0.5%  xxxd3014xxx  decreased plasma concentrations of
 xxxd3521xxx  in  xxxg1318xxx -deficient mice. choy et al. [30] reported
that dietary supplementation with 1%  xxxd3014xxx  decreased the
concentration of  xxxd3521xxx  in the aortic arch and descending
aorta of apoe−/− mice. they did not show plasma data, but suggested
that low plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations influence  xxxd3521xxx 
concentrations in aortic tissue. the present results show that both
plasma cholesterol and  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations decreased after
 xxxd3014xxx  treatment and that the reduction in  xxxd3521xxx  levels was
larger than the reduction in plasma cholesterol levels. these findings
confirm that  xxxd3014xxx  does not reduce plasma  xxxd3521xxx  levels by
merely reducing plasma lipoproteins as the main reservoir of
 xxxd3521xxx , but selectively inhibits  xxxg9xxx , leading to a direct
 xxxd3521xxx  reduction. this provides evidence that not only
cholesterol, but also  xxxd3521xxx  is a direct substrate for  xxxg9xxx .
furthermore, in vitro experiments in hepatocyte cultures show that
 xxxg9xxx  plays an important role in the secretion of  xxxd3521xxx .
as we previously reported [15],  xxxd3521xxx  is also secreted to a
certain extent from cultured hepatocytes not expressing alpha-ttp (see
fig. 1b, where  xxxg173xxx  amounts to zero). it is not clear whether alpha-ttpindependent secretion is limited to cultured hepatocytes or occurs
also in the liver under in vivo conditions. however, we hypothesize
that this alpha-ttp-independent secretion of  xxxd3521xxx  from hepatocytes is also mediated by  xxxg9xxx , since this secretion was stimulated
by  xxxg173xxx  (fig. 1b) and inhibited by  xxxd3014xxx  (fig. 2b).
qian et al. [16] observed that fluorescent-labeled tocopherol
arrives in the lysosome following its internalization from serum
complexes. tocopherol translocates from lysosomes to the cell surface
in an alpha-ttp-dependent manner. it seems unlikely that alpha-ttp delivers
 xxxd3521xxx  to  xxxg9xxx  directly, since we could not show a direct
protein–protein interaction between alpha-ttp and  xxxg9xxx  (unpublished
observations). we hypothesize that alpha-ttp transports  xxxd3521xxx  to
the plasma membrane, where it is picked up by  xxxg9xxx  and excreted
from the hepatocyte.
based on our results, we recommend that physicians, when
treating hyperlipidemic patients with  xxxd3014xxx , check the patients'
plasma  xxxd3521xxx  concentrations and consider giving them
 xxxd3521xxx  supplements. alternatively, it is possible that that  xxxd3014xxx 
will replace  xxxd3521xxx  in its function as an antioxidant due to its
strong antioxidative capacity. further studies are needed to determine
whether  xxxd3014xxx  can replace  xxxd3521xxx  in its function as a fat-soluble
antioxidant or whether it has physiological roles.
