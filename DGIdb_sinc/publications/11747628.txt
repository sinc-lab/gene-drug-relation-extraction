abstract
the present study provides evidence that the in vitro cultured fibroblast cell line from desmoid tumors differs from normal fibrobasts in its extracellular matrix (ecm) macromolecule composition and is modulated
by treatment with  xxxd3402xxx , an antiestrogen that reduces tumor mass by an unknown mechanism. the results showed increased transforming growth factor-b1 (tgf-b1) production, tgf-b1 mrna expression, and
tgf-b1 receptor number in desmoid fibroblasts compared with normal cells. as desmoid fibroblasts did not
produce  xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ) but were sensitive to it, which enhanced glycosaminoglycans (gag)
accumulation, we assessed the tgf-b1 effects on  xxxg2296xxx  production by human monocytes. our results showed
tgf-b1 significantly increased  xxxg2296xxx  secretion by monocytes.  xxxd3402xxx  mediated its effects in desmoid
fibroblasts via an  xxxg730xxx -independent pathway. it inhibited gag accumulation and the secretion
of both latent and active forms of tgf-b1 and had an inhibitory effect on  xxxg2296xxx  production by monocytes.
our results suggest that in reducing tgf-b1 production by desmoid fibroblasts and  xxxg2296xxx  production by
monocytes,  xxxd3402xxx  may restore the balance between the two growth factors.

introduction

d

esmoid tum or is a hereditary disease caused by an autosomal dominant gene mutation.(1) it has a low incidence

in the general population but is a frequent manifestation of
gardner’s syndrome in conjunction with familiar polyposis
coli, osteomas, and sebaceous cysts.(2) histologically, desmoid
tumor is classified as fibromatous (which covers a wide range
of dysplastic connective tissue lesions), with interwoven
bundles of spindle cells surrounded by variable amounts of
collagen. treatment of desmoid tumor is difficult because
of the high rate of recurrence after surgical removal. exeresis is often incomplete because of massive infiltration of vital structures.(2)
several studies have reported the use of two antiestrogenic
triphenylethylene derivates, tamoxifen and  xxxd3402xxx , in the
treatment of human breast cancer with positive steroid receptor status.(3) results with tamoxifen and  xxxd3402xxx  were good
in patients with  xxxg730xxx -negative breast cancer and in
patients with advanced desmoid tumor.(4,5) how the antiestrogens reduce tumor size is still unknown, but evidence exists for
1department

autocrine and paracrine mechanisms, as antiestrogens modulate
growth factors produced by stromal cells and inflammatory tumor-associated cells, such as macrophages.(6)
tumor cells grow through their ability to produce, secrete,
and respond to growth-stimulatory polypeptides via receptormediated pathways. transforming growth factor-b1 (tgf-b1)
stimulates the expression of a wide range of extracellular matrix (ecm) macromolecules, including proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans (gag), collagen, and fibronectin.(7–9) the ability of tgf-b1 to alter cell growth and cell-matrix interactions
suggests it plays a role in modifying the invasive and metastatic potential of tumor cells.
 xxxg2296xxx -a ( xxxg2296xxx ) is a cytokine with
pleiotropic activity that initially was identified in animal studies as one of the factors responsible for anorexia and cachexia.
it is a mediator released in response to a variety of stimuli, such
as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps). in minute amounts,
 xxxg2296xxx  behaves as a physiologic regulator of many functions,(10) but massive  xxxg2296xxx  release produces severe damage
to various host tissues. indeed, elevated plasma  xxxg2296xxx  levels
have been found in patients with malignant lymphoma.(11)

the aim of the present study was to determine if there is an increased accumulation of ecm macromolecules in the desmoid fibroblast cell line and if tgf-b1 or  xxxg2296xxx  or both are involved.
in addition, the effects of  xxxd3402xxx  on tgf-b1 secretion,  xxxg2269xxx  mrna expression, tgf-b1 receptors, and ecm macromolecule accumulation in human desmoid and normal fibroblasts were
investigated. the effects of  xxxd3402xxx  and tgf-b1 on  xxxg2296xxx 
production by monocytes also were evaluated. the results provide
evidence that  xxxd3402xxx  inhibits tgf-b1 production by the human desmoid fibroblast cell line and  xxxg2296xxx  production by monocytes, thus restoring the balance between the two growth factors.

materials and methods

100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 u/ml streptomycin
in a humidified 5% co2 atmosphere at 37°c.
human monocytes were obtained from peripheral blood of
normal healthy adults, anticoagulated with acid citrate dextrose,
and subjected to  xxxd3253xxx -hypaque gradient centrifugation.(12)
briefly, monocytes were isolated from the mononuclear fraction by countercurrent elutriation, using a sorvall rc 26 plus
centrifuge. the elutriation buffer consisted of phosphatebuffered saline (pbs) containing 2% fbs (endotoxin level
,0.002 ng/ml). greater than 95% of the cell in the monocyte
suspension were viable, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion,
and .85% were positive for nonspecific esterase staining.

immunostaining procedure for  xxxg730xxx  assay

materials
 xxxd3402xxx  (4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1-{4-[2-(n,n-dimethylamino) ethoxy] phenyl}-1-butene) citrate was purchased from
farmos (farmos group ltd, turku, finland), human recombinant  xxxg2296xxx  was from genzyme corporation (cambridge,
u.k.), human tgf-b1 was from gibco (paisley, u.k.), and
125 i-tgf-b1 was purchased from amersham life science, ltd.,
buckinghamshire, u.k.).

cell cultures
fibroblast cell lines, obtained from patients with gardner’s
syndrome, were provided by nigms (camden, nj). the gmo
6965 cell line was obtained from phenotypically healthy fibroblasts, and the gmo 6888 cell line was obtained from desmoid
fibroblasts. all cell lines were cultured in eagle’s minimal essential medium (mem) (sigma, st. louis, mo) supplemented
with 20% fetal bovine serum (fbs) (gibco-brl, grand island, ny), 2% nonessential amino acids (gibco), 2 mm

gmo cell lines were processed by immunocytochemical assay for estrogen receptors according to the protocol of the commercially available abbott er-ica kits(13) (abbott park, il).
a rat monoclonal antibody (mab) to human estrogen receptors
(h222spg) was used as the primary antibody. after incubation
with the primary antibody for 30 min, the specimens were incubated with a bridging secondary antibody (goat antirat), followed by rat peroxidase-antiperoxidase (pap) complex. the
pap complex was detected by incubation in diaminobenzidine
solution containing 0.06% h2o2 for 6 min. counterstaining was
performed with harris hematoxylin. positive staining with erica was localized to the nuclei of breast cancer cells.

preparation of conditioned medium (cm)
confluent normal and desmoid fibroblasts were washed with
physiologic solution and cultured for 12 h in serum-free mem.
this medium was discarded to avoid contamination by serum
factors. the cells were cultured for the next 24 h in mem alone
or in mem containing 0.5 and 1 mm  xxxd3402xxx  in ethanol (fi-

was left untreated, and another was acidified with 1 n hcl and
neutralized with 1 n naoh before being used to activate the
latent form of tgf-b1.
human monocytes (1 3 106 /ml) were seeded in 2-cm3 multiwell plates after one washing with rpmi alone for 5 h. monocytes were then incubated with fresh rpmi containing 4 ng/ml
tgf-b1 or 0.5–1 mm  xxxd3402xxx  in ethanol (final ethanol concentration 0.1% v/v). control cells received only ethanol. after 48 h, cm were collected, 1 mm pmsf was added, and the
cm were centrifuged at 3000 rpm at 4°c for 10 min. cm were
then dialyzed, lyophilized, dissolved in eagle’s mem (protein
concentration 50, 125, 250 mg/ml), and used for  xxxg2296xxx  assay.

washed with 1 ml/well binding buffer (mem 1 0.1% bovine
 xxxg124xxx  [bsa] 1 25 mm hepes, ph 7.4) and incubated in it for 2 h at 37°c to allow dissociation of bound endogenous tgf-b1. then, cells were washed once more with 1

added over a concentration range of 1–400 pm.
nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 nm
unlabeled tgf-b1. binding buffer alone was added to the four
wells used for cell counts. cells were incubated for 3 h at 4°c,
and the plates were gently agitated. the cell monolayers were
then washed four times with ice-cold hanks’ buffered saline

gag synthesis
total gag production was significantly higher in desmoid
than in normal fibroblasts, and cellular and extracellular levels
were both significantly elevated (table 1). gag synthesis and
secretion were evaluated after continuous exposure for 48 h to
 xxxd3402xxx , tgf-b1, or  xxxg2296xxx .  xxxd3402xxx  had a similar inhibitory dose-dependent effect on normal and desmoid fibroblasts. in the presence of  xxxd3402xxx  plus thrombospondin,
gag synthesis returned to levels overlapping with control values. tgf-b1 and  xxxg2296xxx  significantly stimulated total gag
production, with  xxxg2296xxx  stimulating more than tgf-b1 in normal and desmoid cells. tgf-b1 determined a more marked increase in the cellular than in the extracellular gag, so the percentage of secreted gag into the medium was slightly
decreased.
ha was the principal gag secreted by normal and desmoid
fibroblasts (table 2). the absolute levels of  xxxd2289xxx 
(ha), heparin sulfate (hs),  xxxd1687xxx  (cs), and dermatan sulfate (ds) were higher in desmoid medium than in controls. as percentages of hs, cs, and ds were increased, ha
was reduced.  xxxd3402xxx  decreased all gag classes in control
and desmoid fibroblasts. as far as the percentage of single gag
classes was concerned,  xxxd3402xxx  increased the percentage of
ha and decreased the percentage of hs, cs, and ds.

tgf-b1 secretion
active tgf-b1, assayed using an elisa kit, was 0.64 pg/mg
protein in untreated cm of normal fibroblasts and 3.7 pg/mg
protein in untreated cm of desmoid fibroblasts (table 3a). the
presence of 1 mm  xxxd3402xxx  reduced active tgf-b1 by about
45% in normal and desmoid cells.
because the latent form of tgf-b1 is activated by acidification and neutralization, in a second set of experiments, cm
was acidified and neutralized (table 3b). total tgf-b1 (active 1 latent form) in cm from desmoid fibroblasts was about
6-fold higher than in normal cells.  xxxd3402xxx  had no effect.
taken together, these data provide evidence that  xxxd3402xxx  inhibited latent tgf-b activation.

tgf-b1 mrna expression
to assess the relationship between tgf-b1 secretion and
tgf-b1 mrna expression, northern blot was performed. in
high-stringency conditions, normal and desmoid fibroblasts
showed a hybridization band at 2.4 kb (fig. 1a). densitometric
analysis of the 2.4-kb band indicated more tgf-b1 mrna in

desmoid fibroblasts than in normal cells (fig. 1b).  xxxd3402xxx 
had no significant effect on normal and desmoid fibroblasts. the
values were normalized to  xxxg861xxx  mrna levels.

tgf-b1 receptors
figures 2 and 3 illustrate tgf-b1 binding to normal and
desmoid fibroblasts and the scatchard plot. binding isotherms
with different concentrations of 125i-tgf-b1 and native  xxxg2269xxx  indicated that tgf-b1 receptor saturation at 4°c was
achieved at 0.30–0.40 nm tgf-b1 in normal and desmoid fibroblasts. scatchard analysis gave a linear plot characteristic of
a single class of high-affinity binding sites with 35,475 receptors per cell and a dissociation constant (kd) of 138 pm in normal fibroblasts (fig. 2) and 53,002 receptors per cell with a kd
of 125 pm in desmoid fibroblasts (fig. 3).  xxxd3402xxx  reduced
the receptor number in desmoid cells (40,956 receptors per cell
with a kd of 107 pm) and had no significant effect on normal
cells (34,331 receptors per cell with a kd of 133 pm).
tgf-b1 receptors were analyzed by electrophoresis on sdspage and fluorography (fig. 4a. the fluorograph showed
three bands corresponding to types iii, ii, and i receptors, respectively. radioactivity was quantified by densitometric analysis, and the absolute counts were converted to percentages assuming 100 as the value of type iii receptors of normal
fibroblasts (fig. 4b). results showed a percentage increase in
type i and ii receptors in desmoid fibroblasts compared with
normal fibroblasts.  xxxd3402xxx  had no significant effects on either normal or desmoid fibroblasts. when an excess of unlabeled tgf-b1 was present, the bands disappeared, thereby confirming the receptors bound to the growth factor (data not
shown).

effects of tgf-b1 and  xxxd3402xxx  on  xxxg2296xxx 
production by human monocytes
levels of spontaneously released  xxxg2296xxx  in cm of human
monocytes untreated or treated with tgf-b1 or  xxxd3402xxx  were
determined using an elisa kit (table 4).  xxxd3402xxx  significantly reduced  xxxg2296xxx  production by about 20% at a concentration of 0.5 mm and by about 50% at a concentration of 1 mm.
tgf-b1 treatment increased the  xxxg2296xxx  level about 2.5-fold.

discussion
desmoid tumors are uncommon nonmetastasizing neoplasms
with an almost acellular core, a diffuse proliferation of welldifferentiated stromal fibroblasts in the periphery, and an aberrant deposition of organic macromolecules in the ecm. several authors have reported that the desmoid tumor may respond
to hormonal manipulation and antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen
and  xxxd3402xxx .(4,5,18) clinical responses range from disease
stabilization to complete resolution in 65% of cases. as desmoid
fibroblasts do not have estrogen receptors, we decided to study
 xxxd3402xxx ’s mechanism(s) of action in an in vitro model of
normal and desmoid fibroblast cell lines.
our report presents data demonstrating that tgf-b1 was 6fold higher in desmoid fibroblasts than in normal fibroblasts,
concurring with results obtained in other tumor cells.(19)

dent manner but had no effect on total (active 1 latent)  xxxg2269xxx , showing that  xxxd3402xxx  inhibits activation of latent  xxxg2269xxx .
to determine whether the higher tgf-b1 production in
desmoid fibroblasts is accompanied by a parallel increase in
tgf-b1 transcripts, mrna expression was assayed before and
after treatment with  xxxd3402xxx . northern blotting analysis revealed an increase in mrna transcripts for tgf-b1 in desmoid
fibroblasts.  xxxd3402xxx  had no effect on tgf-b1 mrna in
both normal and desmoid cells.
tgf-b1 elicits its effects on cell phenotype and physiology
via three distinct cell surface receptors. the number and type
of receptors for tgf-b1 were analyzed in both normal and
desmoid fibroblast cell lines with and without  xxxd3402xxx . there
were more tgf-b1 receptors in desmoid than in normal fibroblasts, and  xxxd3402xxx  reduced the number of receptors only in
desmoid cells. tgf-b1 binds to at least three types of membrane receptors, denominated type i, type ii, and type iii receptors. type i and type ii receptors mediate tgf-b1 response,
and both receptors are required for signal transduction. type
iii receptor contributes to the presentation of ligand to type ii
receptor but lacks any consensus signaling motif.(20) it has been
suggested that ecm macromolecule accumulation is mediated
by the type i receptor and growth inhibition by type ii.(21) analysis of each class of tgf-b1 receptor showed a percentage increase in type i and ii receptors in desmoid compared with normal fibroblasts. interestingly, the type i receptor favors organic
macromolecule accumulation in the ecm. (21)
as tumor growth is associated with abnormal production of
growth factors and ecm macromolecules and gag production
is altered in several connective tissue diseases, such as otosclerosis, apert’s syndrome, and cleft palate,(22–25) we investigated gag synthesis in normal and desmoid fibroblasts. we
found the total amounts of gag and specific gag classes were
significantly higher in desmoid fibroblasts. ha was the major
class in the medium of normal and desmoid fibroblasts.
desmoid cells secreted more collagen fibers(26) and a higher
percentage of sulfated gag than normal cells. tgf-b1 increased gag accumulation, whereas  xxxd3402xxx  reduced it.
moreover,  xxxd3402xxx  decreased the percentage of sulfated
gag in the ecm. as sulfated gag appear to be linked to an
increased collagen fiber diameter,(27) the  xxxd3402xxx -inducedreduction could contribute to shrinking collagen in size. when
 xxxd3402xxx  and thrombospondin,(28) which converts latent  xxxg2269xxx  to its active form, were both present in cell cultures, gag
synthesis increased to control levels. the results of this series
of experiments confirm that the decrease in gag synthesis in
the presence of  xxxd3402xxx  is due to lack of latent tgf-b1 activation.
when released locally at injury sites, tgf-b1 may stimulate
monocyte recruitment, activation, and release of angiogenic
substances, such as  xxxg2296xxx , which is involved in tumor progression.(11,29)  xxxg2296xxx  is expressed by monocytes in a paracrine
fashion and sometimes by tumor cells in an autocrine fashion.(10,28) normal and desmoid fibroblasts did not produce  xxxg2296xxx  (data not shown) but were responsive to  xxxg2296xxx  treatment,
which significantly increased gag accumulation in the intracellular and extracellular compartments. because fibroblasts
were sensitive to  xxxg2296xxx , we determined whether tgf-b1 or
 xxxd3402xxx  or both modified  xxxg2296xxx  production by monocytes.

969

experiments on human monocytes demonstrated that  xxxg2296xxx 
secretion was stimulated by tgf-b1 and inhibited by
 xxxd3402xxx .
in conclusion, our data show that the desmoid fibroblast cell
line has enhanced tgf-b1 secretion, tgf-b1 mrna expression, and tgf-b1 receptors. tgf-b1, in turn, increases  xxxg2296xxx  production by human monocytes. by decreasing tgf-b1 production and activation by desmoid cells,  xxxd3402xxx  may disrupt
this cytokine regulatory pathway.
