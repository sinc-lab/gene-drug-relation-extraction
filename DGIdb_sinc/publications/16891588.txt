abstract: on the basis of peripheral (nonbrain) neuroendocrine findings in subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder (ptsd), it has been
hypothesized that these individuals also have a greater central (brain)
sensitivity to glucocorticoids. in nonpsychiatric subjects, it has been
found that working and declarative memory performance is selectively
impaired by acute glucocorticoid administration. we hypothesized that
subjects with ptsd, as compared to nonpsychiatric controls, would
show greater impairments in verbal declarative memory and working
memory, but not attention, following exogenous glucocorticoid administration. these data are part of a larger study using functional neuroimaging and peripheral hpa axis measures in these same subjects.
subjects underwent a 0.5-mg dexamethasone suppression test and measurement of basal cortisol, basal plasma lymphocyte  xxxg1601xxx  number, and postdexamethasone cortisol on a separate day. under
double-blind randomized crossover conditions, 17-mg hydrocortisone or
placebo was administered by intravenous (i.v.) bolus to 15 medicationfree ptsd subjects (4 female) and 12 nonpsychiatric control subjects
(4 female) matched by age, sex, and education level. participants then
underwent positron emission tomography (pet) scanning and 90 min
after the initial drug/placebo administration, cognitive testing was then
performed. by repeated measures ancova (covaried for baseline performance on that neuropsychological test), neither attention tasks of
digit span forward nor backward showed significant change. however,
there were significant drug (f = 17.644, df = 1,25 p < 0.001), group

(f = 4.383, df = 1,25 p = 0.048), and drug by group interactions
(f = 4.756, df = 1,25 p = 0.040) for verbal declarative memory. by
t-test, there was not a difference in baseline performance on this measure between subject groups. the subject group with ptsd experienced
a greater decline in verbal declarative memory performance following
hydrocortisone administration. for working memory, there were significant group (f = 6.048, df = 1,25 p = 0.022) and drug by group
interactions (f = 6.048, df = 1,25 p = 0.022) for verbal declarative
memory. by t-test, there was not a difference in baseline performance
on this measure between subject groups. the hydrocortisone administration led to impairment in working memory in the group of subjects
with ptsd, but not in the control subject group. exploratory correlations between percent cortisol suppression following dexamethasone and
baseline plasma lymphocyte  xxxg1601xxx  number with declarative and working memory measures among subject groups separately
and in a combined way revealed a negative correlation between lymphocyte  xxxg1601xxx  density and working memory (r = −0.54,
df = 25, p = 0.008). brain sensitivity to glucocorticoids appears to be
greater in subjects with ptsd. heightened vulnerability of declarative
memory in subjects with ptsd may indicate hippocampal involvement,
whereas working memory vulnerability suggests additional brain regions
(prefrontal, cingulate, temporal, and parietal cortices) and neurotransmitter systems (dopamine and serotonin) particularly sensitive to glucocorticoids in persons with ptsd.

introduction
a variety of recent investigations conducted in healthy control subjects have
demonstrated that acute elevations in cortisol levels have negative effects on
specific types of cognitive function. in one of the earliest series of studies,
wolkowitz and colleagues administered a single 1 mg of dexamethasone, and
80 mg of prednisone for five days in a row and found that both steroids interfered with paragraph recall (declarative memory). the glucocorticoids did not
affect attention.1 this was not just an acute time-limited effect, for in another
study 1 mg of dexamethasone taken orally for 4 days interfered with paragraph
recall as measured 4 and 11 days later.2 in addition to impairing verbal declarative memory, a single 10 mg oral dose of cortisol was found to significantly
impair spatial declarative memory. priming and procedural memory were not
affected.3 the application of exogenous glucocorticoids was one means of isolating the effect of various neurotransmitter and hormone alterations occurring
during psychological stress. indeed, social stress, which doubled basal cortisol levels impaired spatial and verbal declarative memory, but not priming or
procedural memory.3

for quite some time, verbal (and spatial) declarative memory were thought
to be the cognitive functions most sensitive to glucocorticoid alterations, presumably through alteration of long-term potentiation (ltp). more recently,
however, lupien and colleagues,4 through use of a continuous 600 g/kg/h hydrocortisone infusion found impairments in declarative memory, but a greater
degree of impairment in working memory.
in summary, working and declarative memory have been found to be sensitive to exogenous and stress-induced alterations in glucocorticoid levels, while
priming, procedural memory, and attention were not found to be sensitive to
glucocorticoid levels changes.
these findings are of particular interest to the study of posttraumatic stress
disorder (ptsd). neuroendocrine alterations in ptsd are well-described and
include lower basal cortisol levels, lower 24-h urinary cortisol excretion,
heightened cortisol suppression following dexamethasone, and increased  xxxg1601xxx  density on peripheral lymphocytes. further, smaller hippocampal volumes have been found in ptsd subjects, high stress/increased
cortisol causes dendritic pruning and eventual death of hippocampal pyramidal
neurons, and memory impairments in ptsd subjects, as compared to normal
controls, have been described in a number of studies.
because of an apparent increased peripheral sensitivity to glucocorticoids
in ptsd, we hypothesized that a similar increased central sensitivity to glucocorticoids in ptsd would be reflected by a greater impairment in verbal
declarative and working memory in ptsd subjects as compared to normal
controls following an intravenous (i.v.) bolus of hydrocortisone. since declarative and working memory is also effected by increased glucocorticoid levels
in normal controls, we were concerned about encountering a floor effect (all
subjects impaired and an inability to detect differences in the level of impairment between ptsd and normal control subjects). for these reasons, we chose
a hydrocortisone dose that would induce a physiological blood cortisol level
equal to high stress (approximately 50–60 g/dl).
these data are part of a larger study using positron emission tomography (pet) and neuropsychological testing following double-blind placebocontrolled hydrocortisone administration. this paradigm is based on5 use of a
35-mg hydrocortisone challenge in alzheimer subjects (who are described as
having decreased central glucocorticoid sensitivity). by analogy of using 0.5
mg of dexamethasone instead of 1.0 mg to better detect increased sensitivity,
we chose a hydrocortisone dose of 17.5 mg.

fifteen subjects with ptsd (4f/11m) and 12 comparison subjects (4f/8m)
in the age group of 20–55 years participated in this study. between groups,
subjects were matched on the basis of age, gender, and level of education. all
subjects were medically healthy and off all psychiatric and hpa axis modifying
medications for greater than 3 months before their participation in the study.
subjects were recruited by newspaper advertisements and by referrals from
mental health professionals aware of our programs. all subjects underwent
a comprehensive medical evaluation to ensure that they were free of major
medical/endocrine disorders. none of the subjects were more than 20% over
or under their ideal body weight. none of the subjects had current or past
alcohol or drug dependence or had an alcohol intake that exceeded one pint
a day of distilled liquor for 10 years or a half-pint per day for 20 years. none
of the subjects met criteria for substance abuse for at least 6 months prior to
participation. subjects with prior heroin or persistent cocaine use, or i.v. drug
use were excluded from the study. urine samples for toxicology screening
were obtained on all subjects, and repeated if an index of suspicion for recent
substance use was present.
psychological testing
all subjects were first given a self-report packet after initial screening determined their eligibility. trauma history was assessed in all subjects using
two instruments with good reliability and validity. the trauma history questionnaire (thq) (40) was used because it assesses a wide range of traumatic
experiences including childhood abuse, assaults, and natural disasters. for diagnostic assessment, subjects were using the structured clinical interview for
dsm-iv axis i disorders (scid-i/p). diagnosis ptsd was by the clinicianadministered ptsd scale (caps-dx) (42). the caps-dx is a structured
clinical interview that is given after the trauma history assessment since the latter facilitates subject recollection of traumatic events. this instrument allows
for a quantitative measure of symptom severity in each of the three symptom
clusters, and yields an overall symptom severity score.
axis i and the diagnosis of ptsd were established in a consensus meeting prior to any biological or neuropsychological testing. subjects who meet
dsm-iv or reasher diagnositic criteria (rdc) criteria for schizophrenia or
any schizophrenia-related psychotic disorders or for bipolar affective disorder
(type i) were excluded.
study protocol
study subjects reported to the mount sinai general clinical research center  xxxd2274xxx :30 am, after having had a light breakfast low in simple sugars and
without caffeine. an i.v. was inserted into the antecubital area at 8 am and
the subject was allowed to relax for the next 90 min. a blood sample was

414

annals new york academy of sciences

then drawn for cortisol level, after which 17-mg hydrocortisone or placebo
was randomly administered by i.v. bolus. subjects returned to the clinical research center (crc) between 5 and 30 days later so each subject received both
hydrocortisone and placebo. a blood sample was again obtained through the
catheter approximately 5 min after the bolus to assess “peak” cortisol levels,
following which 5.5 mic of 1 fdg was administered. subjects relaxed with
eyes closed for 30 min in a quiet room, after which they underwent pet scanning. after scanning was complete, and additional blood sample was obtained
and neuropsychological testing commenced (approximately 30 min after the
initial hydrocortisone/placebo bolus).
neuropsychological testing
neuropsychological testing was performed in a quiet room by a research
psychologist, blind to whether placebo or hydrocortisone had been administered. testing was taped in order to verify test results. auditory attention
was assessed by the forward and backward digit span portion of the wechsler
adult intelligence scale (wais-r). auditory working memory was assessed
by letter-number sequence (wais-r). declarative memory was assessed by
the paragraph recall from the wechsler memory scale-iii (wms-iii). percent
retention after delay (for stories a and b) was the primary measure used to
assess declarative memory.
hpa axis assessments
cortisol level was determined through use of a commercial ria kit (diasorin). the inter and intra-assay coefficients of variation were 4.0% and 6.8%,
respectively.

information about gr analysis
statistical analyses
student’s t-tests were used to assess for baseline differences between groups
for the four neuropsychological measures. repeated measures analysis of covariance (ancova) with covariates of baseline neuropsychological performance were used to assess for group, drug, and drug by group interactions
for each of the four neuropsychological measures. on an exploratory basis,
declarative and working memory measures were correlated with percent cortisol suppression following 0.5 mg of dexamethasone and baseline density of
plasma lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors.

results
by repeated measures ancova (covaried for baseline performance on that
neuropsychological test), neither attention tasks of digit span forward (fig. 1).
nor backward (fig. 2). showed significant group, drug, or drug by group interactions.
there were, however, significant drug (f = 17.644, df = 1,25 p < 0.001),
group (f = 4.383, df = 1,25 p = 0.048), and drug by group interactions
(f = 4.756, df = 1,25 p = 0.040) for verbal declarative memory (fig. 3).
by t-test, there was not a difference in baseline performance on this measure
between subject groups. the subject group with ptsd experienced a greater
decline in verbal declarative memory performance following hydrocortisone
administration.
for working memory, there was not an overall drug effect (f = 1.931, df =
1,23 p = 0.178). there were significant group (f = 6.048, df = 1,25 p = 0.022)
and drug by group (f = 6.048, df = 1,25 p = 0.022) interactions (fig. 4).

the hydrocortisone administration led to impairment in working memory in
the group of subjects with ptsd, but not in the control subject group. there
was not an overall significant drug effect, due to the complete absence of any
drug effect in the control subjects.
a strong negative correlation was found between baseline working memory
and baseline density of glucocorticoid receptors on peripheral blood lymphocytes (r = −0.54, df = 26, p = 0.008) (fig. 5).

discussion
our finding that the ptsd subjects, as compared to controls, showed greater
impairments in declarative and working memory following hydrocortisone administration, supports the hypothesis that individuals with ptsd have an increased central sensitivity to glucocorticoids. the specificity of these effects

was demonstrated, as in other neuropsychological studies, by the lack of
glucocorticoid-mediated effects on attentional measures in either group.
the findings of increased sensitivity to glucocorticoids in subjects with
ptsd in the areas of both declarative and working memory, however, implicate more than one pathophysiological explanation. within the hippocampus,
plasma levels of glucocorticoids have been shown to demonstrate an “inverted
u” relationship to efficacy of ltp.6 ltp is believed to be the neurobiological
mechanism underlying the ability to strengthen neuronal connections within
the hippocampus and surrounding regions,7 thereby allowing verbal and spacial
information to be stored in what has been termed declarative or explicit memory. our data suggest that in subjects with ptsd, this inverted u curve is shifted
to the left, such that these individuals experience glucocorticoid-mediated impairments in declarative memory at relatively lower ambient glucocorticoid
levels.
practically speaking, this indicates that individuals with ptsd will be subject to cortisol-mediated memory impairments at relatively lower cortisol levels, such as those that may occur during relatively common stressors, such
as social anxiety, or ones that they may be particularly sensitized to, such as
traumatic cues. treatment with antidepressants appear to increase plasma lymphocyte glucocorticoid receptors and may alter hpa axis feedback sensitivity
and glucocorticoid sensitivity in general—perhaps directly addressing one of
the pathophysiological alterations in ptsd.
working memory has also been shown to be impaired by an elevation in
plasma glucocorticoid levels.4 working memory, however, largely occurs in

418

annals new york academy of sciences

the prefrontal, cingulate, temporal, and parietal cortices.8 as opposed to earlier
data, it has been more recently found that in primates, the frontal lobes have a
greater  xxxg1601xxx  richness than the hippocampi.9–11 glucocorticoid effects in these brain areas appear not to be through modulation of ltp,
but rather through modulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic function (particularly the  xxxg1108xxx  receptor).12 since subjects with ptsd also experienced
a greater impairment in working memory following hydrocortisone administration, altered glucocorticoid modulation of dopaminergic and serotonergic
function in persons with ptsd is suggested.
prior work by kirschbaum and colleagues13 has reported on increased
plasma lymphocyte  xxxg1601xxx  density in subjects with ptsd.
typically, receptor density for a ligand is inversely correlated with the relative
ambient levels of that ligand. hence, in ptsd, it does make sense that increased
 xxxg1601xxx  numbers are found in a setting of lower ambient cortisol levels. also consistent is the finding that receptor number is directly related
to sensitivity to the ligand. this is also demonstrated in subjects with ptsd
who have been shown, in numerous studies, to have a greater suppression of
endogenous cortisol production in response to a dexamethasone challenge test.
our exploratory finding of a strong negative correlation between plasma lymphocyte  xxxg1601xxx  number and working memory performance in
the entire subject pool indicates that there may be a “necessary but evil” relationship between a greater sensitivity of the system to detecting and regulating
glucocorticoids, and the negative effects those glucocorticoids may then have
on cognitive function both acutely and chronically.
it will be important to understand the different roles that altered sensitivity
to glucocorticoids play both centrally and peripherally in persons with ptsd,
and how these roles in different brain regions and for different brain functions are related to one another. to this end we are actively studying brain
metabolism changes as a result of glucocorticoid administration in ptsd, in
itself, and in relation to neuropsychological test performance and peripheral
glucocorticoid/hpa axis measures.
