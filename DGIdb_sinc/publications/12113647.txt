abstract

at present, the first-line drugs for treating atopic dermatitis are topical corticosteroids. they are effective
when used short-term; however, long-term use of the corticosteroids is associated with suppressive effects on
the connective tissue, seen as skin atrophy or resistance to therapy. currently, two topical noncorticosteroid
 xxxd371xxx  tacrolimus (fk506) and  xxxd2954xxx  (sdz  xxxd2954xxx ) are under development, or already
on the market in some countries for atopic dermatitis. these two compounds show structural similarity. in
t lymphocytes they bind to the same cellular receptor, the fk-binding protein (fkbp) or macrophilin12. tacrolimus shows a 3-fold greater affinity to fkbp compared with  xxxd2954xxx . the tacrolimus/
 xxxd2954xxx –fkbp complex further binds to calcineurin, an enzyme vital for the early activation of t cells.
the consequence of calcineurin binding is a lack of activation of both t helper cell types 1 and 2. further effects
of these compounds have been suggested on other inflammatory cells, such as langerhans cells and mast
cells/basophils. in contrast to corticosteroids, no suppressive effects on connective tissue cells have been observed. taken together, treatment of inflammation results in healing of the barrier function of the skin. this
again results in reduced bioavailability of the drug, as compared with systemic use.
placebo-controlled studies have shown the efficacy of both tacrolimus (at 0.03 and 0.1%) and  xxxd2954xxx 
(at 0.6 and 1%). the main adverse event in these studies has been a burning sensation and increased pruritus at
the site of application. typically, these adverse events are observed only during the first days of treatment.
long-term safety studies, of up to one year, have not revealed any new adverse events. so far, long-term use of
topical noncorticosteroid compounds has not been associated with signs of immune deficiency. although there
is currently no evidence for clinically relevant, prolonged adverse effects, some of these, such as an increased
risk of photocarcinogenesis, need to be monitored. there is evidence from tacrolimus studies that monotherapy
results in better long-term results when compared with combination therapy with corticosteroids. tacrolimus
and  xxxd2954xxx  could replace topical corticosteroids as the first-line treatment of atopic dermatitis.

atopic dermatitis is a common disease of unknown etiology.
both genetic and environmental factors play a role in its clinical
manifestations. the disease is characterized by itchy, dry skin, a
chronically relapsing course, and susceptibility to cutaneous infections.[1,2] the therapies used so far for the treatment of atopic
dermatitis include topical corticosteroids as first-line therapy,
systemic corticosteroids, natural or artificial ultraviolet (uv)
therapies, and immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine,
methotrexate, and cyclosporine as second-line therapy.[3] of these
treatments, efficacy in placebo-controlled trials has only been
demonstrated for topical corticosteroids and oral cyclosporine.[4,5] like other secondary treatments for atopic dermatitis,
cyclosporine diminishes, but does not abolish, the need for topical

corticosteroid treatment.[6,7] attempts to develop a topical formulation of cyclosporine with efficacy in atopic dermatitis have
failed.[8,9] in contrast, similar formulations of tacrolimus were
effective in dinitroclorobenzene-induced atopic dermatitis.[10]
early clinical studies demonstrated the efficacy of tacrolimus
ointment in atopic dermatitis.[11,12] today, the new topical noncorticosteroid  xxxd371xxx , tacrolimus (fk506) and
 xxxd2954xxx  (sdz  xxxd2954xxx ) have shown efficacy and an excellent safety profile in clinical studies as topical monotherapy
for atopic dermatitis (figure 1).[13-17] therefore, they are the first
potential candidates to supplant topical corticosteroids as the primary treatment of atopic dermatitis.
in this review, we compare the mode of action of the new

noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory agents, with an emphasis
on human studies, and review key clinical studies performed for
efficacy and safety with topical tacrolimus and  xxxd2954xxx .
1. how do topical noncorticosteroid
 xxxd371xxx  work in atopic dermatitis?
1.1 altered immunity in atopic dermatitis

patients with atopic dermatitis show signs of altered immunity in their skin and peripheral blood.[2,18] the skin of most patients with atopic dermatitis is colonized with microbes such as
staphylococcus aureus and malassezia furfur (pityrosporum
ovale/orbiculare). the incidence of viral infections with herpes
simplex, viral warts and molluscum contagiosum is increased.
the majority of the patients show diminished delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions to recall antigens of bacterial or fungal
origin. most patients have increased levels of immunoglobulin
(ig) e in both the peripheral blood and the skin. this ige has
specificity to various exogenous environmental antigens, and
also sometimes to intrinsic antigens.
1.2 the role of exogenous antigens

the skin in patients with atopic dermatitis differs in several
aspects from normal skin (figure 2). the 500 dalton (d) rule has
been proposed as a model for the penetration of small molecules.
according to this rule, molecules which are larger than 500d
cannot penetrate normal epidermis.[19] it should be emphasized
that this rule is not universally accepted. tacrolimus has a molecular size of 822d, and  xxxd2954xxx  of 810d; they do not penetrate normal skin. in atopic dermatitis, both the dry skin and visibly inflamed skin show impaired barrier properties, which can
be measured as increased transepidermal water loss.[20] studies
using the atopy patch test have demonstrated that large exogenous
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

polypeptides, of the size 15 to 20kd, can penetrate atopic skin
and cause an immune reaction of the skin.[21,22] in atopic skin
these environmental polypeptides can be bound to  xxxg376xxx + antigen-presenting cells of the epidermis, such as langerhans cells
(lc) and inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (idec), which
both contain increased densities the high-affinity receptor to immunoglobulin e (fcepsilonri) on their cell surface.[23] this facilitates
the binding of the exogenous environmental polypeptides with
the help of free specific immunoglobulin e to the antigenpresenting cells. this ‘antigen-focusing’ is an especially effective
way to present specific antigen to t cells.[24] an additional t cell
activation is caused by nonspecific polyclonal t cell activation
by superantigens, such as staphylococcal enterotoxins, shown to
be common in atopic dermatitis skin[25,26] (figure 3).
1.3 t helper cell subtypes

the lesional skin of atopic dermatitis contains a large number
of t cells which show characteristic cytokine profiles. in a fresh
lesion the infiltrate is characterized by cells of the t helper cell
type 2 (th2) cytokine profile, whereas the chronic lesion the t
helper cells show a cytokine profile mainly of t helper cell type
1 (th1).[18] using a mouse model of atopic dermatitis, spergel et
al.[27] showed that both th1 and th2 cytokines are necessary to
develop a mature atopic dermatitis lesion. t cells are activated
via a calcium-dependent pathway in which calcineurin dephosphorylates the nuclear factor of activated t cell protein (nfatp) (for further information see schreiber and crabtree[28] and
sigal and dumont[29]). nf-atp then migrates to the t cell nucleus, where it leads to the transcription of interleukin (il)-2 and
other cytokines. this early activation leads to secretion of il-2
receptor and through an autocrine pathway leads to activation and
proliferation of t cells which can be selectively inhibited by the
topical noncorticosteroid immunomodulating agents.[30,31]

dendritic cells could represent a target of tacrolimus in therapy
for atopic dermatitis.
tacrolimus and  xxxd2954xxx  block the early activation of t
cells by binding to the fk506 binding protein ( xxxg798xxx ), a 12kd
macrophilin.[33,34] the  xxxg798xxx /tacrolimus or  xxxd2954xxx 
complex inhibits calcineurin and thereby the dephosphorylation
of nf-atp and expression of inflammatory t cell cytokines, such
as il-2,  xxxg1177xxx , il-4,  xxxg1180xxx ,  xxxg526xxx , interferon (ifn)-gamma and  xxxg2296xxx 
(tnf)-alpha.
in vitro studies have also shown that both tacrolimus and
 xxxd2954xxx , through a mechanism that involves binding to the
fk506-binding protein, also inhibit the release of inflammatory
mediators from mast cells and basophils.[35,36]

1.4 effects of tacrolimus and  xxxd2954xxx 

all studies on antigen-presenting cells have so far been done
with tacrolimus only.[23,24] on the inflammatory epidermal and
dermal cells in the skin, tacrolimus and corticosteroids seem to
have quite opposing effects (figure 2). in langerhans cells in
vitro, tacrolimus down-regulates the expression of fcepsilonri; in contrast, betamethasone up-regulates its expression.[24] the downregulation of fcepsilonri by tacrolimus is of potential clinical significance in the therapy of atopic dermatitis. it is currently not known
whether the action of tacrolimus on fcepsilonri depends, as in t cells,
on nf-atp.
wollenberg et al.[32] showed, in an in vivo intervention study
with topical tacrolimus, that an increased proportion of  xxxg376xxx +
cells in the epidermis of atopic dermatitis lesions decreased to
normal during clinical improvement with tacrolimus ointment.
the  xxxg376xxx + population consisted of lc and idec. an analysis
of the relative proportion of these cell types showed that the decrease in  xxxg376xxx + cells was mainly due to a decrease in idec. the
reduction of  xxxg376xxx + cells during treatment with tacrolimus ointment was accompanied by down-regulation of fcepsilonri expression
in both idec and lc. the authors concluded that the  xxxg376xxx +

1.5 staphylococcus aureus and atopic dermatitis

s. aureus is a contributing factor increasing the severity of
atopic dermatitis. s. aureus is found in more than 90% of atopic
dermatitis skin lesions.[18] at our center, in a study of 19 patients,
we found that staphylococcal colonization of atopic dermatitis
lesions significantly decreased after 1 week, 6 months and 12
months of treatment with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment compared

with baseline.[37] these decreases followed clinical improvement. tacrolimus has no inhibitory effect on bacteria in vitro,
including s. aureus;[38] thus decreases in colonization probably
reflect improvement of skin barrier function. studies have shown
that the colonization of atopic dermatitis skin with superantigenproducing s. aureus contributes to the severity of atopic skin
disease.[39-41] superantigen-mediated activation of t cells are resistant to corticosteroids, which may, in part, account for the increased clinical severity.[25] hauk and leung[26] showed that
tacrolimus specifically blocks s. aureus superantigen-induced t
cell proliferation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with atopic dermatitis and healthy volunteers, compared
with dexamethasone. antigen-processing by lc seems not to be
involved in this process. interestingly, it was recently shown that
nf-atp controls superantigen-induced shock.[42] this is important, as the inhibitory effect of tacrolimus on t cells is mediated
through the same pathway, the calcineurin-mediated dephosphorylation of nf-atp. the fact that this path is independent of the
 xxxg1601xxx  could account for the positive therapeutic
response observed with tacrolimus ointment in patients with
atopic dermatitis who are clinically insensitive to topical corticosteroid therapy.
1.6 the dermis and noncorticosteroid
immunomodulation

compared with healthy dermis, the dermis of patients with
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis shows decreased amounts of
collagens type i and iii (h. kyllönen et al., unpublished observations), the two collagens which form over 70% dry weight of the
skin (figure 2). currently, it is not clear whether these reduced
amounts are solely due to decreased synthesis after corticosteroid
therapy[43] or uv-phototherapy,[44] or whether inflammation in
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

atopic dermatitis increases degradation of collagen. the reduced
collagen synthesis can be seen in extreme cases as visual atrophy.
while it is clear that this atrophy is to a large part due to inhibitory
effects of external corticosteroids on collagen synthesis, other
intrinsic factors have to be considered. many studies have shown
important inhibitory or stimulatory effects of inflammatory
cytokines on collagen or proteases causing collagen breakdown.[45-48] a study has shown that either type i or iii collagen
can serve as a reservoir of inflammatory cytokines, such as  xxxg1173xxx .[49] in addition, a recent study has suggested that the presence
of type i collagen causes direction of early maturation of th cells
towards th1, rather than th2.[50] taken together, at the present it
is not clear how much of the reduced collagen synthesis is due to
corticosteroids and how much due to inflammation. in future this
question may be answered using noncorticosteroid monotherapy.
until now, most studies attributing the effect of corticosteroids on the dermis and collagen synthesis, have either used
healthy individuals or the corticosteroid effect has been measured
by ultrasound. the ultrasound does not seem a reliable method
for detecting inflamed skin, because even if total control of the
disease is achieved residual inflammation will make the skin appear thicker than without inflammation. short-term treatment
with tacrolimus under occlusion did not have any effect on the
collagen synthesis of treated skin in healthy individuals and patients with atopic dermatitis. betamethasone, in contrast, reduced
type i collagen synthesis to 20% and that of type iii collagen to
30% of baseline value.[51] betamethasone, but not tacrolimus,
also reduced skin thickness both in controls and patients with
atopic dermatitis.  xxxd2954xxx  was studied under nonoccluded
condition in healthy individuals for 28 days.[52] no effect on skin
thickness was seen. however, the true clinical situation is longterm treatment. we have noticed a more than 2-fold increase in
collagen synthesis in patients previously treated with corticosteroids after 1 year of tacrolimus treatment (h. kyllönen et al.,
unpublished observations), suggesting that a repair is possible
after prolonged corticosteroid treatment.
2. clinical efficacy
2.1 efficacy compared with placebo

several placebo-controlled studies with tacrolimus[13,14,20,53]
and  xxxd2954xxx [16,17,54,55] have shown significant efficacy of
these compounds as compared with vehicle treatment. in the first
randomized, double-blind study with tacrolimus ointment in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, performed as a
multi-center study in europe, ointments containing 0.03% (n =
54), 0.1% (n = 54), and 0.3% tacrolimus (n = 51), or a vehicle
control (n = 54) were applied twice daily in 13 to 60-year-old
patients.[13] treatment duration was 3 weeks, and the treatment
area was less than 10% of body surface area (not more than
1000cm2). efficacy was measured with a combined score for eram j clin dermatol 2002; 3 (6)

ythema, edema and pruritus. the median decrease in clinical
score was significantly greater than vehicle control for all the
tacrolimus concentrations used. there was no significant difference among the three concentrations. a similar double-blind,
multicenter study was performed in the us in 180 children aged
7 to 16 years old.[14] results of this 3-week study was similar to
the european study with all tacrolimus ointments (0.03, 0.1 and
0.3%) being significantly more effective than vehicle treatment.
three placebo-controlled studies comparing tacrolimus 0.03,
0.1% and vehicle with a 12-week duration have been performed
in the us.[53,54,56] the total number of patients in these three studies was over 900. tacrolimus was significantly more effective
than placebo in all studies. no significant difference was observed between the two tacrolimus concentrations studied. in all
five studies treatment efficacy compared to baseline was clearly
over 50%.[13,14,53,54,56]  xxxd2954xxx  cream was compared to vehicle in a proof-of-concept study in a single-center study performed in amsterdam.[16] the size of the lesion was 1 to 2% of
total body area.  xxxd2954xxx  cream 1% was applied once or
twice daily.  xxxd2954xxx  was significantly more effective than
vehicle treatment, whereas twice daily application was significantly more effective than once daily.
in a randomized, double-blind multicenter three-week study
with 260 adult patients,  xxxd2954xxx  cream (0.05, 0.2, 0.6 and
1%) were compared with vehicle and  xxxd322xxx 
cream.[17] with the exception of the lowest concentration of
 xxxd2954xxx , all other concentrations were more effective than
vehicle treatment. there was a dose-dependent increase of efficacy with increasing concentration of  xxxd2954xxx . the average
improvement with 1%  xxxd2954xxx  was slightly under 50%
(46.7%). when treatment efficacy was compared to clinical severity of disease, treatment results were better in patients with
mild disease compared to those with moderate disease.two independent 6-week, randomized, multicenter trials studying a total
of 403 patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis compared
treatment with 1%  xxxd2954xxx  cream or vehicle cream.[57] significant improvement in clinical score relative to vehicle treatment was observed with  xxxd2954xxx  treatment. the overall improvement was comparable to the adult study of 3 weeks.[17]
2.2 efficacy compared with corticosteroids

short-term studies of 3 weeks duration have compared
tacrolimus with hydrocortisone acetate in children,[58] tacrolimus
with hydrocortisone butyrate in adults,[59] and  xxxd2954xxx  with
 xxxd322xxx .[17] tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1% was compared to 1% hydrocortisone acetate treatment in 2 to 15-year-old
children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in a 3 week
randomized, double-blind study.[58] treatment was restricted to
60% of total body surface. both tacrolimus concentrations were
significantly more effective than hydrocortisone acetate, with
tacrolimus 0.1% being significantly more effective than 0.03%,

a finding not seen in us studies.[53,54,56] in adult patients with
moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, tacrolimus 0.03 and 0.1%
twice daily was compared to 0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate, a
midpotent to potent topical corticosteroid.[59] tacrolimus 0.1%
showed similar efficacy as hydrocortisone butyrate, and both
these ointments were significantly more effective than 0.03%
tacrolimus ointment.
comparisons of  xxxd2954xxx  cream (0.05, 0.2, 0.6 and 1%)
to  xxxd322xxx  cream in 260 adult patients with
mainly moderate atopic dermatitis showed that betamethasone
valerate was significantly more effective than  xxxd2954xxx  at all
concentrations studied (0.05 to 1%).[17]
full reports of long-term comparative studies are not available. one such study, of  xxxd2954xxx  compared with triamcinolone acetate cream is available as an abstract and showed similar
efficacy of both treatments for those patients who completed the
study.[60] over 50% of the patients on  xxxd2954xxx  did not complete the study, which raises questions about an intent-to-treat
analysis as it would seem likely that patients with more severe
disease might have a less effective treatment result.[18,60,61]
we believe that the true test of these compounds will be in
long-term use, as this is a chronic disease that tends to need longterm treatment. although topical corticosteroids are often used
long-term for the treatment of atopic dermatitis they are only
approved for short-term use. therefore, there is practically no
data available on whether we should use them until all symptoms
have vanished or sparingly to have best efficacy, while avoiding
adverse effects. the ongoing long-term comparative study of
tacrolimus/corticosteroid should shed light on this question.
2.3 safety

burning sensation of the skin was the only adverse event that
showed a higher incidence with tacrolimus ointment or
 xxxd2954xxx  cream, compared with the vehicle control in shortterm studies.[13,14,16,17] in long-term studies skin burning, erythema and pruritus were common, but tended to occur only during
the first few days of treatment.[15,56,62] burning and also erythema
of the face were aggravated by alcohol uptake in some patients.
the cause of burning is not known, and it is unclear whether any
treatment, e.g. antihistamines, could be useful in the prevention
of it. using timed suction blisters of the skin, we have observed
that there is an early release of some neuropeptides which could
be responsible for these symptoms (reitamo s et al., unpublished
observations). uncontrolled safety studies of 1 year duration did
not show any safety concerns.[15,56,62] bacterial colonization with
s. aureus was reduced to a great extent and there were no other
apparent signs of immune suppression. using historical comparisons there was no apparent increase in herpes simplex infection.[15,63] also, there was no decrease in recall antigen reactions[15] and the number of pigment nevi had not increased
(reitamo s et al., unpublished observations). long-term comparam j clin dermatol 2002; 3 (6)

monotherapy.

ative studies for tacrolimus are ongoing. so far, however, the
main outcome seems to be that these compounds have a good
safety profile and can therefore be used long-term.[15,56,62] during
long-term studies with tacrolimus, some of our patients experienced several months in which no treatment was necessary
(reitamo s et al., unpublished observations). it would be of interest to assess this prospectively. long periods of clearance, in
which treatment would be unnecessary, would be a great advantage over conventional corticosteroid treatment.
laboratory profiles during several long-term studies have
been unremarkable.[15,56,62] drug concentrations in the blood
have been shown to decrease a few days after starting therapy for
both tacrolimus and  xxxd2954xxx .[13,64] during long-term treatment about 75% of the patients did not show detectable blood
concentrations of tacrolimus.[15] the only exception has been
children with netherton syndrome, an autosomal recessive disease characterized by congenital erythroderma, who despite a
good treatment results showed high tacrolimus trough blood concentrations.[65] blood concentrations from  xxxd2954xxx  longterm studies have not yet been reported. in a short-term study they
have been low.[64]
there has been no evidence of an increased risk of any type
of infection compared with historical data from the literature. in
terms of mode of action, topical tacrolimus and  xxxd2954xxx 
may decrease immune surveillance of treated skin, and thus, over
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

a period of many years, increase the risk of basal cell or squamous
cell carcinoma. thus, patients receiving therapy with a topical
immunomodulator should be educated on adequate measures of
sun protection, and an important aim of post-marketing research
should be long-term safety.
3. why should patients be treated
with monotherapy?
we have experience from many patients who have used
cyclosporine, together with topical corticosteroids, who have significantly improved after switching to tacrolimus monotherapy
(reitamo s et al., unpublished observations). this suggests that
tacrolimus monotherapy can greatly improve the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis (figure 4). when tacrolimus is used as longterm treatment in a clinical research project which emphasizes
treatment of all atopic dermatitis until the skin is totally cleared
and pruritus as resolved, an improvement in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis of at least 90% can be expected
in half of the patients.[15] these findings need to be reperated in
a controlled study. total use of tacrolimus ointment decreased
with time, and some patients also had treatment-free periods of
several weeks. after 12 months of monotherapy several patients
showed normalization of the transepidermal water loss and they
had no pruritus. in patients with at least 90% improvement, we
have observed also a decrease in serum and skin immunoglobulin

e levels (reitamo s et al., unpublished observations). this improvement of the skin, apparently to normal, after long-term
tacrolimus treatment raises questions of whether all skin symptoms in atopic dermatitis are actually of a secondary nature, with
a primary disorder in the bone marrow cells. this would mean
that the disease would need redefining since pruritic dry skin has
been the central prerequisite for the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.
sugiura et al.[66] showed recently that by treating only the
face with tacrolimus, and the rest of the body with corticosteroids,
there was, after an initial response, quite poor long-term results.
these results were dependent on the severity of dermatitis, with
treatment results inversely related to severity of dermatitis.[66] we
can confirm these findings from several patients treated outside
clinical trials.
most of the patients undergoing  xxxd2954xxx  treatment in
clinical trials had either mild or moderate disease, although a few
had severe atopic dermatitis. from the available study in adults
it can be concluded that approximately half of such patients will
respond to  xxxd2954xxx  monotherapy.[17] the treatment results
with  xxxd2954xxx  in pediatric studies seem better.[54,55] however, these studies used vehicle as control therapy and corticosteroids were allowed as rescue therapy. therefore, the results cannot be directly compared with those from the adult studies.
4. status of marketing approvals
for atopic dermatitis, tacrolimus ointment 0.1% has been on
the market in japan for treatment of adults since 1999 and in the
us and canada since 2001 as 0.03 and 0.1% ointment for adults
and 0.03% ointment for children. a marketing authorization application for tacrolimus ointment 0.03 and 0.1%, has been approved by the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal
products (the drug is now available in many european countries).
 xxxd2954xxx  cream 1% is being developed for atopic dermatitis.
in the us,  xxxd2954xxx  cream 1% was approved in 2001. in
europe it should be available in denmark in 2002.
5. conclusions
the main advantage of topical noncorticosteroid immunomodulatory agents is that they do not cause skin atrophy and
therefore do not prevent healing of the skin. tacrolimus and
 xxxd2954xxx  have a similar structure and mode of action, but
comparison of three 3-week clinical studies using the same efficacy parameters and corticosteroid comparators, although no direct comparison, suggest that tacrolimus is more effective.[17,58,59]
to avoid any possible risks associated with the use of these two
treatments, detailed knowledge of drug blood concentrations in
comparison with clinical outcome needs to be obtained. it seems
likely that the group of patients who would benefit least from
treatment would be those with severe and wide-spread disease

who experience poor efficacy, so that any risks do not outweigh
the benefits. the clinical data collected so far indicates that there
is no increased risk of skin cancer, infection or other undesirable
immunosuppressive effects.
