 xxxg196xxx  channels integrate  xxxd94xxx  and multiple
inflammatory signals through the nonproton
ligand sensing domain

abstract
background: acid-sensing ion channels (asics) have long been known to sense extracellular protons and
contribute to sensory perception. peripheral  xxxg196xxx  channels represent natural sensors of acidic and inflammatory
pain. we recently reported the use of a synthetic compound, 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (gmq), to identify a
novel nonproton sensing domain in the  xxxg196xxx  channel, and proposed that, based on its structural similarity with
gmq, the arginine metabolite  xxxd94xxx  (agm) may be an endogenous nonproton ligand for  xxxg196xxx  channels.
results: here, we present further evidence for the physiological correlation between agm and  xxxg196xxx . among
arginine metabolites, only agm and its analog arcaine (arc) activated  xxxg196xxx  channels at neutral ph in a sustained
manner similar to gmq. in addition to the homomeric  xxxg196xxx  channels, agm also activated heteromeric  xxxg196xxx  plus
asic1b channels, extending its potential physiological relevance. importantly, the process of activation by agm was
highly sensitive to mild acidosis, hyperosmolarity,  xxxd208xxx  (aa), lactic acid and reduced extracellular ca2+.
agm-induced  xxxg196xxx  channel activation was not through the chelation of extracellular ca2+ as occurs with
increased lactate, but rather through a direct interaction with the newly identified nonproton ligand sensing
domain. finally, agm cooperated with the multiple inflammatory signals to cause pain-related behaviors in an
 xxxg196xxx -dependent manner.
conclusions: nonproton ligand sensing domain might represent a novel mechanism for activation or sensitization
of  xxxg196xxx  channels underlying inflammatory pain-sensing under in vivo conditions.

background
acid-sensing ion channels (asics) represent a new subgroup of the epithelial sodium channel/degenerin
(enac/deg) family of ion channels. to date, functional
cloning studies revealed four genes that give rise to at
least six asic informs (asic1a, asic1b, asic2a,
asic2b,  xxxg196xxx , and asic4) [1]. these isoforms, which
are composed of cytosolic n and c termini, two transmembrane helices, and a disulfide-rich, multi-domain
extracellular region, can associate into homo- or heterotrimers [1,2]. asics are amiloride-sensitive voltage-independent cationic channels that are activated by a

decrease in extracellular ph [3]. protons trigger a transient inward current that desensitizes rapidly in all forms
of asics except  xxxg196xxx , which displays a sustained current that does not fully desensitize despite prolonged
exposure to acidic extracellular ph [4-7].  xxxg196xxx  is predominantly expressed in sensory neurons and has been
shown to be a sensor of acidic and primary inflammatory pain [8,9]. in addition to protons, a synthetic compound, 2-guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (gmq) has
been found to activate  xxxg196xxx  channels at physiologically
normal ph in a sustained manner [10]. furthermore,
gmq acts at a site on the  xxxg196xxx  that is separate from
the known proton binding sites [10]. the identification
of this nonproton ligand sensing domain argues that
natural ligands beyond protons may activate asics
under physiological conditions.

it metabolically interconvertible with the amino acids
proline and glutamate, but it also serves as a precursor
for synthesis of protein,  xxxd2738xxx  (no),  xxxd94xxx 
(agm), polyamines, ornithine, and urea [11]. among
these, agm and polyamines (including  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine, and putrescine) are positively charged at physiological ph and thus can interact electrostatically with
negatively charged nucleic acids and proteins, including
receptors and ion channels. for example, extracellular
agm binds to imidazoline receptors [12,13], and blocks
n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors [14] and other
ligand- or voltage-gated cation channels [15-17]. however, intracellular  xxxd3234xxx  and spermidine contribute
to the rectification of inward rectifier k + channels
[18,19] and certain types of glutamate receptors [20,21].
furthermore, polyamines block the transient receptor
potential melastatin (trpm) channels, trpm4 [22] and
 xxxg2333xxx  [23], and serve as potent ligands for the  xxxg2335xxx  transient receptor potential  xxxd428xxx 
type 1 (trpv1) [24] and the  xxxg343xxx 
[25], a g-protein-coupled receptor that contributes to
the regulation of calcium homeostasis. in addition,  xxxd3234xxx  produces complex effects on nmda receptors,
with either stimulating activity [26,27] or inducing a voltage-dependent blockade [28]. interestingly,  xxxd3234xxx 
shifts the steady-state desensitization of asic1a channels to more acidic ph conditions [29] and contributes
significantly to ischemic neuronal injury through enhancing asic1a activity [30].
furthermore, peripheral agm and polyamines are
implicated in inflammation and pain signaling. levels of
agm and polyamines are increased during infection,
trauma, and cancer [31,32]. in a previous study, we have
shown that extracellular agm and its structural analog
arc (figure 1a) activate  xxxg196xxx  at neutral ph [10]. in
this study, we further showed that agm-induced activation of  xxxg196xxx  is profoundly potentiated by mild acidosis, hyperosmolarity, increased  xxxd208xxx  (aa), or
reduced extracellular ca2+, conditions that occur during
inflammation and many other pathophysiological processes [8,33-39]. furthermore, agm cooperated with
the multiple inflammatory signals to cause pain-related
behaviors in an  xxxg196xxx -dependent manner.

results & discussion
agm but not polyamines activates  xxxg196xxx  channels

the fact that agm directly activates  xxxg196xxx  channels
[10] prompted us to look for the effects of polyamines
and other arginine metabolites [11] (figure 1a). conventional whole-cell patch clamp recordings were performed in chinese hamster ovary (cho) cell lines
transiently expressing  xxxg196xxx  tagged with gfp to measure the functional activation of  xxxg196xxx  channels under
voltage clamp conditions. at a concentration of 1 mm,

only agm and its analog arc (figure 1b), but not
polyamines (including  xxxd3234xxx , spermidine, and putrescine), nor l-arginine, nor  xxxd2793xxx , were able to activate the  xxxg196xxx  channel at ph 7.4. the resistance
of  xxxg196xxx  to polyamines differs from the modulation of
asic1a by  xxxd3234xxx  [29,30] and the modulation of
trpv1 by polyamines [24], arguing for multifunctional
roles of arginine metabolites in inflammatory responses
[40]. therefore, as two major sensors for inflammatory
pain,  xxxg196xxx  and trpv1 sense different arginine metabolites (agm of  xxxg196xxx  vs. polyamines of trpv1,
respectively).
agm is widely and unevenly distributed in mammalian tissues [41]. observed first in the rat brain, agm
was shown later that its concentration in the brain (2.40
ng/g) is lower than in others, such as stomach (71.00
ng/g), intestine, spleen and liver (5.63 ng/g) [42]. the
relative low concentration of agm in normal tissues
together with the relative low potency of agm on

http://www.molecularpain.com/content/6/1/88

 xxxg196xxx  channels (3.3 ± 0.3% of the gmq’s response,
figure 1b) argue for the negligible contribution of agm
under physiological conditions. however, agm is
detectable in human plasma and higher concentrations
have been observed in depressed patients [43]. similarly,
levels of peripheral agm and polyamines are elevated
during infection, trauma, and cancer [31,32]. interestingly, agm evokes  xxxg196xxx -dependent pain-behavior in
mice [10], suggesting that agm- xxxg196xxx  interaction may
become functionally relevant under pathological
conditions.
synergic effect of agm and mild acidosis on  xxxg196xxx 
channels

pain conditions are associated with multiple inflammatory signals (mild acidosis, hyperosmolarity, increased
 xxxd208xxx , or reduced extracellular ca 2+ ). to
understand the functional relevance of agm- xxxg196xxx 
interaction, we examined the ph dependence of agm
action by applying graded ph to the cho cell expressing
 xxxg196xxx  channels, in the presence or absence of agm
(figure 2a). we found that when the typical biphasic
 xxxg196xxx  responses were evoked by a ph reduction, agm
dramatically enhanced the sustained component (figure
2a, c), without altering the peak component (figure 2a,
b). the effect was most evident under mild acidosis conditions (ph 7.2~6.8). this enhancement could be simply
the summation of two independent currents induced by
agm and mild acidosis, respectively. to address this
issue, we explored the interaction between agm and ph
7.0 more specifically (figure 2d-f). we found that ph
7.0 significantly potentiated agm response and the
potentiation was always more than additive with ph
reduction regardless the sequence of agonist application
(figure 2d, e), a characteristic that is opposite to the
accelerated asic desensitization caused by pretreatment
with acidic solution [36]. this potentiation occurred only
under the simultaneous presence of two ligands (i.e., h+
and agm) (figure 2d, e, panels i and iii), suggesting
coincident detection of proton and nonproton ligands by
 xxxg196xxx  channels in vivo. remarkably, a significant potentiation was observed even when agm was applied at
lower concentrations (~100 mum, figure 2f). the inability
of agm pretreatment to enhance  xxxg196xxx  response to
mild acidosis (figure 2d, e, panel ii) suggests a novel
mechanism underlying the observed synergy between h+
and agm that differs from the allosteric effect of tarantula toxin psalmotoxin 1 (pctx1) on asic1 channels
[44,45].
it is well known that peripheral ph falls to < 7 during inflammation, infection, ischemia, hematomas, and
exercise [1]. moreover, such acidosis is well recognized
to activate nociceptors and to produce pain in humans
that can be attenuated by the enac/deg inhibitor

amiloride [46-48]. additionally, inflammatory mediators, such as  xxxg1564xxx  (ngf), serotonin (5ht), interleukin-1, bradykinin, and brain-derived  xxxg1614xxx  (bdnf) can stimulate  xxxg196xxx  transcription, which perhaps contributes to the painenhancing effects of these mediators [49,50]. thus,
 xxxg196xxx  channels seem to act as a major inflammatory
pain integrator [8,9]. considering that both agm production [31,32] and  xxxg196xxx  expression [51,52] are
increased during inflammation, the positive synergy
between h + and agm in activating  xxxg196xxx  channels
adds a new level of complexity to the molecular events
that can lead to inflammatory pain. the dramatic
enhancement under ph 7.2-6.8 (figure 2c) is reminiscent of a previous observation reporting sustained
‘window’ current through  xxxg196xxx  channels at modest
ph changes presumably contributing to myocardial
ischemia [36]. whether agm regulates cardiac painsensing [36] and other forms of muscle pain [9,52,53]
awaits further investigations.
synergy between agm and hyperosmolarity

in inflamed or injured tissues, multiple mediators meet
in the interstitial fluid and form an inflammatory
exudate, the content of which is acidic [34] and hyperosmotic [37]. previous studies have shown that hyperosmolarity increases neuronal excitability in drg neurons [8],
affecting preferentially the sustained component of  xxxg196xxx 
currents. these previous studies promoted us to examine
the synergy among hyperosmolarity, acidosis, and agm.
 xxxg196xxx -expressing cho cells were exposed to agm and
mild acidosis in the absence or presence of hyperosmolarity (figure 3). the hyperosmolarity (600 mosmol kg-1 with
mannitol) itself did not induce any detectable current (figure 3a) but significantly potentiated the  xxxg196xxx  currents
evoked by a ph reduction to 7.0 (figure 3), an effect previously observed in rat drg neurons or an  xxxg196xxx  expressing f-11 drg cell line [8]. similarly, the current induced
by agm was markedly enhanced by hyperosmolarity (figure 3). interestingly, agm caused further increase over
the current induced by the combination of ph 7.0 and
hyperosmolarity (figure 3), suggesting that agm, mild
acidosis, and hyperosmolarity act synergically to facilitate
 xxxg196xxx  opening, which may explain the enhanced sensory
neuronal excitability under conditions of inflammation [8]
or cardiac ischemia [36].
synergy between agm and  xxxd208xxx 

next, we tested  xxxd208xxx  (aa), a pro-inflammatory and ischemic factor which enhances asic currents
induced by acid and increases neuronal excitability
[8,54,55]. at the physiological normal ph, aa induced
negligible currents from  xxxg196xxx -expressing cho cells
(figure 4a). as expected, aa significantly potentiated

agm (1 mm)-induced currents (figure 4). the relatively slow developing kinetics of the agm current following addition of aa (figure 4a) presumably reflects
the slow onset of aa effect which requires several minutes to be fully established [8]. therefore, agm not
only activates  xxxg196xxx  by itself at normal ph (figure 1;
ref. [10]), but also exerts positive cooperative effect
when administrated with other inflammatory factors
such as mild acidosis, hyperosmolarity, and aa, further
strengthening the notion that  xxxg196xxx  channels act as a
multiple sensor to integrate diverse signals present in
the pathophysiological environment [8,9].

we also investigated the sensitivity of agm-induced
currents to alterations of extracellular ca2+, which has
marked effect on the gmq response [10]. as shown in
figure 5a, b, the presence of 10 mm extracellular ca2+
completely abolished the agm currents, whereas reducing ca 2+ significantly potentiated agm-induced
currents. low ca 2+ itself evoked a significant inward
current (figure 5a, left panel), consistent with a previous report [56]. thus, similar to gmq [10], agmasic3 interaction is highly sensitive to altered extracellular ca 2+ . the extracellular ca 2+ concentration can
decrease from a resting value of around 1.2-1.8 mm to
values as low as 0.08 mm under certain conditions [38],
suggesting that the signaling cascade induced by agmasic3 interaction might be markedly amplified under
such conditions. moreover, lactate produced by anaerobic metabolism reduces extracellular ca2+ concentration
and results in the enhancement of the acid-induced
asic currents in ischemia-sensing neurons [39]. likewise, agm-evoked currents were increased about 3folds when lactate and agm were co-applied (figure
5c, d). these results suggest that  xxxg196xxx  channels may
be gated in vivo by the combined actions of reduced
extracellular ca 2+ , mild acidosis, and agm through
synergic interactions reported here.
it is, however, possible that agm-induced  xxxg196xxx 
channel activation was through the chelation of extracellular ca2+ as observed with lactate [39,56] at neutral
ph. to clarify this possibility, we recorded  xxxg196xxx 
response to agm in ca 2+ -free external solution. we
found that agm activated  xxxg196xxx  channels regardless
the presence or absence of extracellular ca2+ (data not
shown). that agm activates  xxxg196xxx  channels independent of ca 2+ chelation is consistent with the notion
that agm modulates  xxxg196xxx  activation via novel
mechanisms (figure 2d, e).
critical role of the nonproton ligand sensing domain

next we asked how agm activates  xxxg196xxx  channels in a
manner similar to gmq, given the difference in their
structural flexibility (linear agm vs. circular gmq with
a heterocycle, figure 1a) [10]. in a previous study, we
have shown that the nonproton ligand sensing domain
plays a critical role in mediating agm and gmq effects
on  xxxg196xxx  [10]. while its critical role for gmq was supported by the fact that covalently linking circular gmq
or tnb to c79 activated asic3e79c channels (with the
gmq-dimer or dtnb treatment) [10], the role of the
same site for the linear agm was  xxxd3237xxx . for
comparison, we tested 2-aminoethyl-methanethiosulfonate (mtsea), a linear thiol-reactive compound on  xxxg196xxx  e79c channels, in which the residue glu79 was
replaced by a cysteine, thus mimicking agm-e79

interaction (figure 6a). bath application of 0.2 mm
mtsea persistently activated asic3e79c channels at ph
7.4 (figure 6b, d). by contrast, mtsea (0.2 mm) was
ineffective in cho cells expressing wild-type (wt, data
not shown) or asic3e423c channels (figure 6b). interestingly, 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate
(mtset, 0.5 mm), a mts reagent in which the amino
group is replaced by a trimethylamine, failed to induce any
detectable currents in asic3e79c-expressing cho cells
(figure 6c), suggesting that the amino group in agm
plays an essential role in activating  xxxg196xxx  channels, as has
been shown in gmq- xxxg196xxx  interaction [10]. together,
these data strongly support that activation of  xxxg196xxx  by
agm relies on polar, steric, and electrostatic interactions
with the nonproton ligand sensing domain in the channel
[10], regardless whether the ligand is linear and flexible
(i.e. agm) or circular and rigid (i.e. gmq).
asic subunit specificity

most asic-like acid-evoked currents in drg neurons
are mediated by heteromers of  xxxg196xxx , -2, and -1 [57].
to address asic subunit specificity, we recorded agm
or arc responses in cho cells expressing different
combinations of asic subunits (figure 7). similar to
gmq [10], none of the homomeric channels asic1a,
asic1b, or asic2a were activated by either agm or
arc (figure 7a, c). however, heteromeric  xxxg196xxx  plus
asic1b channels responded to agm and arc (figure

7b, d) in a manner similar to homomeric  xxxg196xxx  channels (figure 7a, c). on the other hand, heteromeric
combinations of  xxxg196xxx  plus asic1a, asic2a, or
asic2b were insensitive to these ligands (figure 7b, d).
this subunit specificity together with the restricted
distribution pattern of  xxxg196xxx  [9] suggests that an
agm-dependent regulatory pathway most likely occurs
in peripheral tissues expressing homomeric  xxxg196xxx  and/
or heteromeric  xxxg196xxx  + 1b channels [8,36,58]. alternatively, agm may act as a co-agonist sensitizing the
apparently-unresponsive heteromeric  xxxg196xxx  channels
(i.e.,  xxxg196xxx  + 1a, 2a, or 2b) (figure 7) to protons. in
addition, according to a recent report [59], agm may
also act on the  xxxg196xxx  channels through coincident
detection of multiple ligands (i.e., agm, h+, and other
factors such as atp) by cross-activating an as yet unidentified ion channel. in addition, the emergence of new
asic isoforms [60] adds an additional possibility underlying the  xxxg196xxx -dependent pain-behavior induced by
agm in vivo [10].
 xxxg196xxx  channels integrate multiple inflammatory signals
in vivo

finally, to gain insights into the pathophysiological relevance of  xxxg196xxx -dependent integration of agm and
multiple inflammatory signals, we performed in vivo
pain-related behavioral tests [10] following the injection
of agm and hyperosmolarity,  xxxd208xxx  (aa), or

lactate into the right hindpaw of  xxxg196xxx +/+ and  xxxg196xxx -/mice. we measured the total time the animals spent
licking the injected paw during a 30-min period. as
shown previously, control  xxxg196xxx +/+ mice showed a significant increase in paw-licking time after agm (10 mm)
injection compared to saline-injected controls [10]. in
consideration of the high agm concentration used, we
re-evaluated the paradigms by injecting 1 mm agm
(figure 8). similarly,  xxxg196xxx +/+ mice showed a significant
increase in paw-licking time after agm (1 mm) injection, though less intense than that observed following
10 mm agm injection [10]. as expected, the reaction
of  xxxg196xxx  -/- mice to agm was significantly reduced

(figure 8). when agm (1 mm) was co-applied with
hyperosmolarity (h-osm, 600 mosmol kg-1 with mannitol), aa (10 mum), or lactate (15 mm, keeping the ph
neutral), the injection elicited more intense response in
 xxxg196xxx  +/+ mice while failed to elicit the comparable
response in  xxxg196xxx  -/- mice. interestingly,  xxxg196xxx  +/+ mice
showed a significant increase in paw-licking time following the treatment of h-osm (600 mosmol kg -1 with
mannitol), aa (10 mum), or lactate (15 mm) alone compared to saline-injected controls. these behavioral
responses were similarly reduced in  xxxg196xxx -/- mice (figure
8), supporting an essential role of  xxxg196xxx  in sensing
multiple inflammatory signals [9], including agm.

conclusions
 xxxg196xxx  channels sense extracellular protons and nonproton ligands, including the endogenous molecule agm,
which is a metabolite of arginine. in this study, we
extended the previous finding that  xxxg196xxx  can be activated by small molecules with basic groups such as
gmq, agm, and arc by uncovering the functional
interactions of agm with multiple inflammatory factors
such as hyperosmolarity,  xxxd208xxx , and lactate.
cysteine modification with a linear thiol-reactive compound that mimics agm binding induces  xxxg196xxx  opening in a sustained manner similar to agm, supporting
the critical role of the newly identified nonproton ligand
sensing domain. in vivo tests using both  xxxg196xxx +/+ and
 xxxg196xxx  -/- mice revealed that agm cooperates with the
multiple inflammatory signals to cause pain-related
behaviors in an  xxxg196xxx -dependent manner. thus, the
present findings suggest a new mechanism for activation
or sensitization of  xxxg196xxx  channels underlying inflammatory pain-sensing under in vivo conditions.

methods
cell culture and transfection

all constructs were expressed in cho cells as described
previously [10]. in brief, cho cells were cultured at 37 °
c in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co2 and 95% air.
the cells were maintained in f12 medium (invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mm l-glutamine, 10% fetal
bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mug/ml
streptomycin. transient transfection of cho cells was
carried out using lipofectamine™2000 (invitrogen).
electrophysiological measurements were performed
24-48 h after transfection.
solutions and drugs

the ionic composition of the incubation solution (ss,
see figures 2e, f and 6b) was (mm): 150 nacl, 5 kcl, 1
mgcl 2 , 2  xxxg2125xxx  2 , 10 hepes, and 10 glucose, aerated
with 95% o2/5% co2 to a final ph of 7.4. the standard
external solution contained (mm): 150 nacl, 5 kcl, 1
mgcl2, 2 cacl2, and 10 glucose, buffered to various ph

was substituted with equimolar n-methyl-d-glucamine
(nmdg). the patch pipette internal solution for wholecell patch recording was (mm): 120 kcl, 30 nacl, 1

mgcl2, 0.5 cacl2, 5 egta, 2 mg-atp, and 10 hepes.
the internal solution was adjusted to ph 7.2 with trisbase. the osmolarities of all these solutions were maintained at 300-325 mosm (advanced instrument, norwood, ma). hyperosmotic (h-osm) conditions were

computer running the clampex and clampfit software
(version 8.0.1, axon instruments). in most experiments,
70-90% of the series resistance was compensated. unless
otherwise noted, the membrane potential was held at
-60 mv throughout the experiment under voltage clamp
conditions. all the experiments were carried out at
room temperature (23 ± 2 °c).
pain-related behavioral assays

figure 8 agm causes pain-related behaviors via  xxxg196xxx 
channels. pain-related behavior as determined by the time spent
for paw licking following saline or agm (1 mm) injection (10 mul) in
the absence (white) or presence (grey) of hyperosmolarity (h-osm,
600 mosmolkg-1 with mannitol), aa (10 mum), or lactate (15 mm,
keeping the ph neutral). data are means ± s.e.m. n = 6-9. *p < 0.05
versus saline; #p < 0.05,  xxxg196xxx -/- versus  xxxg196xxx +/+; &p < 0.05.

obtained by adding mannitol to the standard external
solution (or saline) as indicating in the text.
solutions with different composition were applied
using a rapid application technique termed the “y-tube”
method throughout the experiments [10]. this system
allows a complete exchange of external solution surrounding a cell within 20 ms.
site-directed mutagenesis

the cdna of rat  xxxg196xxx  was subcloned into the
pegfpc3 vector (promega corporation, madison, wi,
u.s.a.). each mutant was generated with the quikchange® mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca) in
accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol using highperformance-liquid-chromatography-purified or pagepurified oligonucleotide primers (sigma-genosys, the
woodlands, tx). individual mutations were verified by
dna sequence analysis, and the predicted amino acid
sequences were determined by computer analysis.
electrophysiology

the electrophysiological recordings were performed
using the conventional whole-cell patch recording configuration under voltage clamp condition. patch pipettes
were pulled from glass capillaries with an outer diameter
of 1.5 mm on a two-stage puller (pp-830, narishige co.,
ltd., tokyo, japan). the resistance between the recording electrode filled with pipette solution and the reference electrode was 3-5 momega. membrane currents were
measured using a patch clamp amplifier (axon 700a,
axon instruments, foster city, ca) and were sampled
and analyzed using a digidata 1320a interface and a

animals were acclimatized for 30 min before experiments. a total volume of 10 mul solution (in 0.9% nacl)
containing either saline (0.9% nacl only), or agm (1
mm), or hyperosmolarity (h-osm, 600 mosmol kg -1
with mannitol), or aa (10 mum), or lactate (15 mm), or
agm + h-osm, or agm + aa, or agm + lactate was
injected intraplantarly using a 30g needle and paw-licking behavior was quantified for 30 min [10].
data analysis

results were expressed as means ± s.e.m. unless otherwise noted, statistical comparisons were made with the
student’s t test.*, or &, or @, p < 0.05 or **p < 0.001 was
considered significantly different. to test the synergic
interaction between two factors (i.e., mild acidosis and
agm, or agm and ca2+ reduction) on  xxxg196xxx  currents,
additional two-way anova analyses were made (figures 2 and 5, p < 0.05 was considered significant). concentration-response relationships for ph-dependent
activation of  xxxg196xxx  channels were obtained by measuring currents in response to acidic solutions with graded
ph values. each acidic solution was tested on at least
three cho cells and all results used to generate a concentration-response relationship were from the same
group. the data were fit to the hill equation: i/imax =1/
[1+(ec50/[ligand])n], where i is the normalized current
at a given ph, imax is the maximum normalized current,
ec50 is the concentration of proton yielding a current
that is half of the maximum, and n is the hill
coefficient.
