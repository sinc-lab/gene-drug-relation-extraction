pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a disease of the pulmonary vasculature
characterized by vasoconstriction and vascular proliferation, which leads to
right heart failure and death. prostacyclin, no and endothelin are felt to be
key mediators in the development of pah. we present the available
published and presented data about  xxxd138xxx , an eta-selective endothelin
receptor antagonist (era) and newest era agent to be approved by the fda
for the treatment of pah in patients with who functional class ii and iii symptoms. randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated a significant
improvement in exercise capacity and decrease in time to clinical worsening,
along with evidence to support an improvement in who functional class and
quality of life for patients receiving  xxxd138xxx . long-term data have shown
a 1-year survival of 95%; of the survivors, 94% remained on  xxxd138xxx 
monotherapy. endothelin receptor antagonists as a drug class have previously
been associated with peripheral edema, aminotransferases abnormalities and
a teratogenic risk to a developing fetus. peripheral edema was observed in
patients receiving  xxxd138xxx ; however, a greater percentage was experienced in patients aged > 65 years. in contrast, significant aminotransferase
abnormalities were not observed with  xxxd138xxx  treatment in the placebocontrolled trials, and in all clinical trials combined the 1-year risk seems to be
low (< 3%). despite these data, the fda requires monthly liver function tests
monitoring. as with other eras, monthly pregnancy testing is required in all
women of child bearing potential.

introduction

pulmonary arterial hypertension (pah) is a life-threatening and rare condition
characterized by vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling resulting in a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (pvr) and pulmonary artery pressure (pap), leading to right heart failure and death. its prevalence is estimated at
15 cases per million people each year, with 2 – 3 times as many women versus
men afflicted [1]. pulmonary arterial hypertension may be idiopathic (ipah),
familial or associated with various conditions, such as connective tissue disease
(ctd), congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, portal hypertension, drug and
toxin use and hiv infection. these groups comprise group 1 of the who
classification, which is the group for which pah therapies are indicated. all of

these disorders share similar proliferative and obstructive
changes of the pulmonary microcirculation.
prognosis of pah is based on hemodynamic and clinical
outcomes, such as exercise tolerance and functional status.
exercise tolerance is generally assessed by the distance a
patient walks in 6 min (6-min walk distance or 6mwd)
and the borg dyspnea index (bdi), a measure of the degree
of breathlessness following exertion. the who classification of functional capacity is routinely used to qualitatively
assess pah functional status with who class i patients
being asymptomatic and class iv patients having the most
severe disease, with signs of right ventricular failure. if left
untreated, patients diagnosed with pah have a poor prognosis and equally compromised quality of life (qol), with a
mean life expectancy of 2 – 5 years from the time of diagnosis [2]. drugs that block or reduce thrombosis, vasoconstriction and hypertrophy associated with the narrowing of
the pulmonary arteries may attenuate the cycle of constriction
and improve pulmonary vascular blood flow.

body of review

2.1

overview of the market

conventional management of pah includes the use of supplemental oxygen, diuretics and digoxin. anticoagulation
therapy may be initiated to prevent secondary in situ thrombosis
in small pulmonary arteries, which may further aggravate pulmonary vascular obstruction [3]. no data from prospective
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are available
to provide clear guidelines for these treatments. the limited data
that is available has only included ipah and use in other
forms of pah is extrapolated from this data. in addition, it has
been shown that patients who have a positive vasodilatory
response during a right heart catheterization have an improved
survival with calcium channel blocker (ccb) therapy. however,
< 10% of pah patients are considered vasoresponsive, and
long-term response to oral ccbs seems to decrease over time.
currently available therapies target three main pathways
in the pathogenesis of pah: the camp-dependent prostacyclin pathway, the cgmp-dependent no pathway and the
phospholipase-c-dependent endothelin pathway. table 1 lists
the therapies available for pah, which all belong to one of
three drug classes targeting these pathways: prostacyclin and
derivatives, pde-5 inhibitors and endothelin receptor
antagonists (eras).
prostacyclin and derivatives mimic the effects of endogenous
prostacyclin (pgi2), a prostaglandin produced by the vascular
endothelium, to stimulate camp-dependent vasodilation of
the pulmonary arterial bed and inhibit platelet aggregation.
the prostacyclin epoprostenol (flolan®; glaxosmithkline,
nc, usa) was the first approved treatment for pah. epoprostenol has shown increased survival over no treatment in
ipah patients and improvement in exercise capacity and
symptoms were demonstrated in pah associated with ctd [4].
despite its complicated, inconvenient administration, as well as
1848

side effects, epoprostenol remains the treatment of choice for
patients with severe pah (who class iv). prostacyclin
derivatives have since been developed with other, potentially
more convenient, routes of administration.  xxxd3415xxx 
( xxxd3415xxx ®; united therapeutics corp., nc, usa) was
originally given marketing authorization for administration as a
continuous, subcutaneous infusion; however, use of this
chronic prostanoid therapy has been associated with pain at
the site of administration, prompting the development of
intravenous, inhaled and oral formulations of  xxxd3415xxx .
the oral and inhaled forms remain under investigation; however
the intravenous form is available.  xxxd2331xxx  ( xxxd2331xxx ®; actelion
pharmaceuticals us, inc., ca, usa), an approved inhaled
prostacyclin, also has delivery complications; with a half-life
of 20 – 25 min, six – nine nebulization sessions per day are
necessary.  xxxd319xxx  sodium is currently the only orally active
prostanoid; however, owing to the lack of sustained long-term
efficacy [5], it was not granted marketing authorization in the
us or the european union (eu). these prostacyclin derivatives
all have side effects similar to epoprostenol (table 1).
sildenafil citrate (revatio®; pfizer labs, ny, usa) which
targets the no pathway, is the first pde-5 inhibitor approved
for the treatment of pah. through inhibition of pde-5,
sildenafil increases cytoplasmic cgmp concentrations in the
smooth muscle cells and enhances no-mediated vasodilation
of the vasculature. sildenafil demonstrated significant benefit
compared to placebo over 12 weeks of treatment; however, the
long-term benefit of the approved dose of sildenafil (20 mg
tid) as monotherapy has not been established. at higher doses,
there was a greater incidence of some adverse events (aes)
including flushing, diarrhea, myalgia and visual disturbances [6].
despite the lack of clinical data showing efficacy, some centers
are prescribing sildenafil at doses higher than the approved
dose. tadalafil is another pde-5 inhibitor under investigation
for pah; it has the advantage of being administered orally,
once daily (qd). data from a phase iii placebo-controlled
pah study, which examined tadalafil doses that ranged from
2.5 to 40 mg qd is currently under regulatory review [7].
the third targeted pathway is the phospholipase-c-dependent
endothelin pathway.  xxxg674xxx  (et-1) is the primary member of a family of potent vasoconstrictor peptides that are known
to play an essential role in mammalian cardiovascular physiology [8]. two receptor subtypes,  xxxg676xxx  (eta)
and b (etb), mediate the effects of et-1. in humans, the eta
receptor is preferentially expressed in vascular smooth muscle
cells and is primarily responsible for the vasoconstrictive as well
as the mitogenic effects of et-1. in contrast, etb receptors are
found mainly in the vascular endothelium and stimulate the
production of no and prostacyclin, resulting in vasodilation,
whereas, on smooth muscle cells etb acts as a vasoconstrictor,
similar to eta. in addition, etb mediates the clearance of
et-1, where it is rapidly cleared from the systemic circulation
primarily by the lungs. in healthy subjects, circulating plasma
concentrations of et-1 are normally quite low; however in
patients with pah, plasma et-1 levels are elevated by as much

as tenfold and seem to correlate well with increased mean right
atrial pressure (mrap) [9,10].
 xxxd358xxx  ( xxxd358xxx ®; actelion pharmaceuticals us inc., ca,
usa) is a sulfonamide-based era with dual (eta/etb)
receptor selectivity; it has demonstrated improvements in
exercise capacity, reduced dyspnea during exercise in patients
with pah and a decrease in the time to clinical worsening [11].
 xxxd3207xxx  (thelin®; pfizer labs, ny, usa) is another
sulfonamide-based era, but is selective for the  xxxg676xxx .
although approved in the eu and canada for the treatment
of pah patients with who class iii symptoms,  xxxd3207xxx 
has not been approved for use in the us.  xxxd138xxx 
( xxxd138xxx ® in the us; gilead sciences, inc., ca, usa;
 xxxd138xxx ® outside the us; glaxo group ltd, middlesex, uk)
is a  xxxd3029xxx  based, eta-selective era that was recently
approved in the us, eu and various other countries for the
treatment of pah patients with who class ii and iii symptoms. the upper respiratory symptoms of nasal congestion,
nasopharyngitis and sinusitis are common aes associated
with era administration (table 1), as are headache, flushing
and peripheral edema. these side effects are believed to be the
result of vasodilation. the main safety concerns of era administration are related to hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity and decreases
in hemoglobin; therefore, liver function tests (lfts), pregnancy
tests and complete blood counts are recommended at frequent
intervals while on treatment. there is considerable debate
regarding whether it is preferable to block both the eta and
etb receptors or target the  xxxg676xxx  alone. a clinically
meaningful difference in efficacy has not been distinguished
with respect to receptor selectivity; therefore, other factors
such as the overall safety profile, convenience of administration
and the presence or absence of drug–drug interactions are likely
to be considered when choosing the appropriate treatment.
2.2

characteristics of  xxxd138xxx 
chemistry and mechanism of action

several in vivo studies.  xxxd138xxx  decreased systemic blood
pressure in normotensive rats and dogs, and also demonstrated a vascular antiproliferative effect in the injured coronary
artery of the pig [14].
in clinical studies, no clinically relevant changes in mean
heart rate were observed with  xxxd138xxx  treatment in healthy
subjects or in patients with pah. a three-arm healthy volunteer study was designed to evaluate the potential for qtc
interval prolongation after the administration of  xxxd138xxx .
the administration of  xxxd138xxx  at fourfold the maximum
therapeutic dose (40 mg p.o.) was associated with a slight
increase in mean time-matched and placebo-adjusted qtc; the
maximum effect (5 ms) was observed at the approximate tmax
of 1.5 h [15]. therefore, for patients receiving  xxxd138xxx  5 or
10 mg qd and not taking metabolic inhibitors, no significant
qt prolongation is expected.
cardiopulmonary hemodynamics were assessed in a subset of pah patients enrolled in the phase ii study of  xxxd138xxx , amb-220. after 12 weeks, mean cardiac index increased
(+0.3 l/min/m2; p < 0.001) for patients receiving  xxxd138xxx  (1 – 10 mg qd). similarly, mean pulmonary artery
pressure (mpap; -5.2 mmhg; p < 0.001) and mean pvr
(-226 dynes·sec/cm5; p < 0.001) decreased for patients receiving
 xxxd138xxx  [16].
b-type natriuretic peptide (bnp), a hormone secreted primarily from the cardiac ventricles, has been proposed as a
prognostic indicator of mortality in patients with pah [17-19].
reductions in bnp have been shown to parallel improvements
in hemodynamics, 6mwd and functional class in patients
with pah [20]. substantial decreases (29 – 45%; p < 0.05) in
bnp were observed in the phase iii pivotal studies of  xxxd138xxx , compared to placebo, and decreases in bnp correlated
with and were predictive of improvements in 6mwd and
who functional class [21].
pharmacokinetics and metabolism

2.2.1

2.2.3

 xxxd138xxx  is a non-sulfonamide,  xxxd3029xxx  based,
eta-selective era. it is a single enantiomer [(+)-(2s)-2-[(4,
6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)oxy]-3-methoxy-3,3-diphenylprop
anoic acid], with a molecular weight of 378.2 g/mol
(figure 1).  xxxd138xxx  is supplied as immediate-release,
film-coated tablets (5 and 10 mg) for qd oral administration.
there are no data to demonstrate a significant difference in
efficacy between the two doses, and there are some dose-related
increases in side effects. in human ventricular myocardial
membranes,  xxxd138xxx  showed high affinity for the eta
receptor (ki = 0.011 nm) and low affinity for the  xxxg677xxx ,
resulting in a > 4,000-fold selectivity [12,13]. similar results were
obtained with endogenously expressed, native receptors, which
indicated that  xxxd138xxx  is a highly potent and selective
antagonist of the  xxxg676xxx .

 xxxd138xxx  is rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation, with cmax observed at ∼ 2 h after administration
(tmax), and both cmax and auc0 – ∞ increase proportionally
over the therapeutic range of the drug [22]. for the 5 and
10 mg dose, the mean terminal half-life is 15 h with a low
accumulation factor [15]. pharmacokinetics were similar in
fed and fasted states, and repeated-dose studies in patients
with pah demonstrated that steady-state was generally
achieved following 4 days of dosing.  xxxd138xxx  aucss,0 – 24
were consistently higher (two- to threefold) in patients with
pah compared to healthy subjects, and the mean oral clearance of  xxxd138xxx  is 38 and 19 ml/min in healthy subjects and in pah patients, respectively. reduction in metabolic
capacity of the liver as a consequence of pah-related hepatic
congestion or hypoperfusion may alter the systemic clearance
of  xxxd138xxx  in patients with pah.
 xxxd138xxx  is highly plasma protein bound, and the
distribution of  xxxd138xxx  into red blood cells is low. it is
primarily metabolized by glucuronidation and to a lesser

extent by oxidative metabolism. glucuronidation occurs by
several uridine glucuronosyltransferase (ugt) enzymes
(1a9s, 2b7s and 1a3s) to form  xxxd138xxx  glucuronide [14].
the metabolite 4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx  is generated
primarily by cyp3a4 and to a lesser extent by  xxxg592xxx  and
cyp2c19 [15]. the auc of this metabolite is ∼ 4% of parent  xxxd138xxx  in plasma, and the binding affinity of
4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx  for the human  xxxg676xxx 
is ∼ 64-fold less than  xxxd138xxx  [14]. therefore, at concentrations observed in the plasma, 4-hydroxymethyl  xxxd138xxx  is not expected to contribute to pharmacological activity
of  xxxd138xxx .
2.2.4

drug–drug interactions

the treatment and management of pah often requires
multidrug regimens; therefore, the risk of adverse drug–drug
interactions should be carefully considered. the sulfonamide-based
eras  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd3207xxx  are primarily metabolized by
the cyp pathway (cyp3a4 and 2c9). in addition, these
eras can induce or inhibit these enzymes, which can lead
to changes in exposure of coadministered drugs, such as
sildenafil (both  xxxd358xxx  and  xxxd3207xxx ) [23,24], tadalafil
( xxxd358xxx ) [25] and the anticoagulant warfarin ( xxxd3207xxx ) [26]. owing to its distinct metabolic pathway, mediated
primarily by a variety of ugt enzymes rather than by one
predominant enzyme, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd138xxx 
are less likely to be affected by coadministered drugs that
induce or inhibit specific phase i or ii enzymes. similarly,
in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that  xxxd138xxx  does not inhibit or induce cyp or ugt metabolic
pathways at clinically relevant concentrations [14]; therefore,
it is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of other drugs
metabolized by these pathways. there is no data in pah
patients with significant hepatic impairment. because there
is in vitro and in vivo evidence of significant metabolic and
biliary contribution to the elimination of  xxxd138xxx ,
hepatic impairment would be expected to have significant
effects on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd138xxx  [15].
in addition, in vitro studies using rat and human hepatocyte cultures have demonstrated that  xxxd138xxx  does not
inhibit the organic anion transporter polypeptide ( xxxg2163xxx ),
sodium- xxxd3296xxx  co-transporter protein (ntcp), multidrug

resistance-associated protein 2 ( xxxg15xxx ) or the bile salt export
pump ( xxxg11xxx ) [13,27]. furthermore, rat hepatocyte assays have
demonstrated that  xxxd138xxx  does not induce protein
levels of  xxxg11xxx  and p-glycoprotein (pgp).  xxxd138xxx  is a
possible substrate for the hepatic influx transporter  xxxg2163xxx 
and the pgp efflux transporter, but not for the hepatic influx
or efflux transporters ntcp or  xxxg11xxx , respectively [13,27].
several clinical studies have been conducted with
 xxxd138xxx  to examine the potential for adverse drug–drug
interactions. in a phase i study,  xxxd138xxx  (10 mg qd)
did not have a clinically relevant effect on the single-dose
pharmacokinetics of 20 mg sildenafil (a cyp3a4 and
cyp2c9 substrate) or the active metabolite, n-desmethyl
sildenafil. similarly, sildenafil (20 mg tid) did not have
a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of a
single dose of  xxxd138xxx  (10 mg) [28]. therefore, no
dose-adjustments of sildenafil or  xxxd138xxx  are required
when coadministered. more recently, several doses of 40-mg
tadalafil (also predominantly metabolized by cyp3a4)
demonstrated no effect on the pharmacokinetics of 10-mg
 xxxd138xxx , and the single-dose pharmacokinetics of tadalafil were unaffected by several doses of  xxxd138xxx  [29]. no
dose adjustments should be needed for coadministration. in
addition,  xxxd138xxx  (10 mg qd) did not have a clinically
relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd990xxx  (cyp2c9
substrate) or r-warfarin (cyp3a4 substrate) in healthy
subjects receiving a single 25-mg dose of racemic warfarin [30].
similarly, warfarin had no clinically significant effects on the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd138xxx . in addition,  xxxd138xxx 
(10 mg qd) did not have a clinically significant effect on
prothrombin time (pt) or international normalized ratio
(inr). consistent with this result, no clinically relevant
changes in pt, inr or warfarin-type anticoagulant dose
were observed with  xxxd138xxx  treatment in the clinical
studies of patients with pah [16,31]. therefore, no dose
adjustments for warfarin or  xxxd138xxx  are required when
coadministered, which is beneficial because many pah
patients are placed on warfarin. furthermore, repeat dosing
of 400 mg qd ketoconazole (a strong inhibitor of cyp3a4)
resulted in increased single-dose auc0 – ∝ (35%) and cmax
(20%) of 10 mg  xxxd138xxx  [32]. the change in exposure is
unlikely to be of any clinical relevance and, therefore,
 xxxd138xxx  may be coadministered with ketoconazole. finally,
exposure of 0.5 mg digoxin (a pgp substrate) was increased
(auc0 – ∝ = 9%; cmax = 29%) in the presence of several doses
of  xxxd138xxx  (10 mg), but these increases were not considered
clinically relevant; no dose adjustments are warranted [33].
2.2.5

clinical efficacy

the efficacy of  xxxd138xxx  in patients with pah was
initially examined in the randomized, double-blind,
dose-ranging study amb-220. patients received a blinded,
oral dose of  xxxd138xxx  (1, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg qd) for
12 weeks, followed by a 12-week, open-label extension
period, where dose adjustments were permitted. the study

 xxxd138xxx 

enrolled 64 patients with ipah, pah associated with
connective tissue disease (pah-ctd), anorexigen use or
hiv infection. all four doses of  xxxd138xxx  administered
in this study provided statistically significant and clinically
relevant improvements in 6mwd with a similar response
for change in 6mwd at week 12 in each dose group
(range: +34 to +38 m). the improvements in 6wmd were
significant at week 12, and increased further at week
24 (combined dose group: +54m) [16]. several secondary
endpoints (i.e., bdi, cardiopulmonary hemodynamics), as
well as a subgroup analysis for pah etiology, suggested that
the higher doses may have increased efficacy.
the double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase iii studies
(aries-1 and aries-2) were identical except for the doses
of  xxxd138xxx  studied, and the location of the investigational sites. aries-1 was done primarily in the us, while
aries-2 was done primarily in western europe. most
patients enrolled belonged to who functional class ii
(38%) and iii (55%) and were diagnosed with ipah
(61 – 66%) or pah-ctd (28 – 34%) [31]. aries-1 patients
received once daily placebo, 5 mg or 10 mg  xxxd138xxx ,
and aries-2 patients received placebo, 2.5 mg or 5 mg
 xxxd138xxx .  xxxd138xxx  was added to conventional
therapy (e.g., anticoagulants, ccbs, etc.); however, treatment
with prostanoids, pde-5 inhibitors or other eras within
4 weeks before screening and throughout the study was prohibited [31]. the results of the aries studies are presented
individually and also as a prespecified integrated analysis.
the primary efficacy endpoint was the change in 6mwd
from baseline to week 12 compared to placebo. at week 12 in
aries-1, a statistically significant increase in the placeboadjusted mean change in 6mwd was observed for the 10-mg
dose group (+51 m; 95% confidence interval, ci: 27 – 76;
p < 0.001) that was nearly 21 m greater than the 5-mg dose
group (+31 m; 95% ci: 3 – 58; p = 0.008) (figure 2). at
week 12 in aries-2, a statistically significant increase in the
placebo-adjusted mean change in 6mwd was observed for
the 5-mg dose group (+59 m; 95% ci: 30 – 89; p < 0.001)
that was 27 m greater than the 2.5-mg dose group (+32 m;
95% ci: 2 – 63; p = 0.022). the difference in the 6mwd
treatment effect for patients in the 5-mg group of aries-1
versus aries-2 was notable but not statistically different. this
variability highlights the challenges of comparing treatment
effects between trials that were conducted independently.
the secondary efficacy endpoint of time to clinical worsening was defined as the time from study randomization to
the first occurrence of death, lung transplantation, hospitalization for pah, atrial septostomy, study discontinuation
owing to the addition of other pah therapeutic agents or
study discontinuation owing to two or more protocol-defined
early escape criteria. in aries-1, twice as many placebo
patients experienced an event of clinical worsening compared to each of the  xxxd138xxx  dose groups; however, the
prespecified analysis did not demonstrate statistical
significance (table 2) [31]. in aries-2, > 4 times the number
1852

of placebo patients experienced clinical worsening compared
to each of the  xxxd138xxx  dose groups, demonstrating a
significant delay in time to clinical worsening of pah
(p < 0.001). hazard ratios demonstrated an 80% reduction
in the probability of clinical worsening for a subject receiving  xxxd138xxx  compared to placebo [34]. in addition, a
prespecified combined analysis of the 5-mg and placebo data
from the two studies resulted in a statistically significant
improvement in time to clinical worsening for patients
receiving  xxxd138xxx  [31].
during review of the  xxxd138xxx  new drug application
(nda), the us fda reassessed the events of clinical worsening in the aries studies. as shown in table 2, a total of
12 clinical worsening events in aries-1 and 20 in aries-2
were included in the prespecified analyses. the fda adjudicated 11 events in aries-1 and 21 in aries-2, as well as
censored 6 cases because the agency determined that these
events did not clearly relate to worsening pah [35]. the
statistically significant improvements observed in the prespecified analysis of aries-2 were verified by the fda analysis. interestingly, the fda analysis of aries-1 indicated
that  xxxd138xxx  treatment was associated with significant
decreases in clinical worsening compared to placebo. based
on these analyses, the fda determined that there was substantial evidence to support the conclusion that  xxxd138xxx 
delays clinical worsening in patients with pah.
improvements in who functional class were observed in
both aries studies, and the treatment effects were driven primarily by less who class deterioration in the  xxxd138xxx -treated
groups compared to placebo. improvements in qol of pah
patients were observed as assessed using the sf-36® health
survey, as were improvements in the degree of dyspnea following
exertion, as measured by the bdi.
2.2.5.1

efficacy of subgroups

gender, age and weight were well-balanced between the treatment groups for the combined analysis of the aries studies [31]. although the percentage of elderly (age > 65 years)
patients studied was not high (∼ 20%), improvements in
6mwd were observed to be smaller compared to younger
patients. as might be anticipated, the elderly were observed to
have higher rates of clinical worsening compared to younger
patients independent of treatment; however, the rates of clinical worsening for both age subgroups were lower with
 xxxd138xxx  treatment compared to placebo [35]. of the
patients comprising the non-ipah subgroup, most (87%) had
pah-ctd. mean improvements in 6mwd were smaller for
the pah-ctd subgroup compared to the ipah subgroup;
however, for both subgroups, the change seemed to be doseresponsive [31,36]. improvements in bdi and a four- to fivefold
decrease in who class deterioration were observed for
 xxxd138xxx -treated patients compared to placebo, independent of etiology. patients with who class ii symptoms at
baseline showed improvements in 6mwd and bdi, which
were similar among the  xxxd138xxx  dose groups. in contrast,

patients with who class iii symptoms seemed to have greater
improvements with higher doses of  xxxd138xxx  [31,37].
2.2.5.2

durability of effect

the most comprehensive long-term data on  xxxd138xxx 
treatment includes patients who completed the phase iii,
pivotal (aries) studies, or placebo patients who prematurely discontinued after meeting the early escape criteria.
these patients were offered a long-term study (aries-e)
where all subjects received  xxxd138xxx  (2.5, 5 and 10 mg).
additional pah therapies (prostanoids and/or pde-5 inhibitors) were permitted. for the 383 patients included in this
analysis, as of november 2006, the mean exposure was
71 weeks (maximum 148 weeks) [38]. of the 318 patients
continuing after 1 year, 298 had completed 48 weeks and
94% (280/298) were receiving  xxxd138xxx  monotherapy.
for these patients, the mean change from baseline in 6mwd
was 40 m at week 12 and 39 m at week 48 [31]. other clinical measures of pah, such as bdi and who functional
class, were also maintained or improved at week 48 over the
week 12 value [38]. one-year survival for pah patients
receiving  xxxd138xxx  in these studies was 95% [15].

2.2.6

safety and tolerability

at the time of the  xxxd138xxx  nda submission, a total of
483 patients had been treated with doses of  xxxd138xxx 
(1 – 10 mg qd), with a maximum exposure to  xxxd138xxx 
of ≤ 4 years [15].  xxxd138xxx  was well-tolerated in these
clinical studies. in the placebo-controlled aries studies,
261 patients received  xxxd138xxx  and 132 received placebo
with 353 patients completing the studies. a total of
10 patients died, 6 of who were in the placebo group [31].
these deaths were primarily owing to cardiovascular failure,
which probably resulted from the progression of their pah;
no deaths were considered related to study drug. the most
frequent severe adverse event (sae) for both groups was
right ventricular failure (placebo 6% and  xxxd138xxx  2%).
overall, more patients in the placebo group compared to
 xxxd138xxx  prematurely discontinued from the studies
owing to death, aes/saes or meeting protocol-defined early
escape criteria [31].
in general, aes observed in the  xxxd138xxx  clinical studies were similar to those observed previously for other eras
(table 1). table 3 presents the most frequently reported aes
in the aries studies [31]; most aes were mild to moderate

in severity. only nasal congestion consistently displayed
trends of increasing frequency with higher dose. the types
of common aes were consistent with aes observed in
phase ii [16], and the ae profile following long-term
 xxxd138xxx  therapy continued to be consistent with that
observed in the 12-week studies [38].
peripheral edema is a known class effect of eras, and is
also a clinical consequence of pah and worsening
pah [11,39]. most edema was mild to moderate in severity in
the aries studies, and few episodes led to premature discontinuation of the study, suggesting that these events were
1854

manageable. the reporting rates of edema were different
between the two studies (table 3); however, neither study
showed a trend of dose-dependence for the event [35,40,41].
there were few notable differences in incidence of aes for
patients by age or gender. peripheral edema was similar in
younger patients (< 65 years) receiving  xxxd138xxx  (14%)
compared to placebo (13%), and was greater in the elderly
(≥ 65 years) receiving  xxxd138xxx  (29%) versus placebo
(4%). the number of patients in the elderly subgroup was
small; hence, these results should be viewed with caution.
clinical experience does suggest that the incidence of peripheral

kingman, ruggiero & torres

edema is greater in the elderly, especially if there is preexistent
edema at time of initiation of  xxxd138xxx  [15].
previous clinical studies with eras for the treatment of
pah have demonstrated dose-dependent increases in serum
aminotransferase concentrations, specifically alanine
aminotransferase (alt) and aspartate aminotransferase
(ast), which may be associated with liver injury [11,39,42]. in
the recent report of  xxxd3207xxx  and  xxxd358xxx  long-term
treatment, the risk of developing elevated alt and/or ast
> 3 × uln at 1 year was 6% with  xxxd3207xxx  (100 mg qd)
and 14% with  xxxd358xxx  (125 mg bid) [43], consistent with
previous reports [11,44]. liver function tests were closely
monitored in all clinical studies with  xxxd138xxx . in the
12-week placebo-controlled studies, the incidence of lft
elevations > 3 × uln was 0% for patients receiving
 xxxd138xxx , compared to 2.3% for patients receiving
placebo [31]. for all  xxxd138xxx -treated patients (n = 483),
the 1-year rate of aminotransferase elevations > 3 × uln
with  xxxd138xxx  was 2.8% [35] and > 8 × uln was 0.5%.
only 1 case of aminotransferase elevations > 3 × uln has
been accompanied by bilirubin elevations > 2 × uln but
this event was concurrent with hospitalization for pneumonia and resolved with resolution of the pneumonia. the
accumulated clinical experience with  xxxd138xxx  suggests
that the incidence of aminotransferase abnormalities was not
greater than the background incidence expected in patients
with pah.
in an uncontrolled, open-label study, 36 patients who had
previously discontinued either  xxxd358xxx ,  xxxd3207xxx  or both
owing to aminotransferase elevations > 3 × uln were treated
with 5 mg  xxxd138xxx  (study amb-222) [15]. patients
received 2.5 mg for 4 weeks, 5 mg for 20 weeks and 2.5, 5 or
10 mg thereafter. one patient experienced a mild aminotransferase elevation at week 12 on  xxxd138xxx  5 mg that resolved
with the decrease of the dosage to 2.5 mg, and did not recur
with later escalation to 10 mg. with a median follow up of
102 weeks and with > 50% of patients increasing the dose
of  xxxd138xxx  to 10 mg, no patient was discontinued for
aminotransferase elevations [45].
the development of drug-related reductions in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have been associated with
era administration, including  xxxd138xxx , and there have
been cases where this has resulted in anemia [15,39,46,47]. in
the placebo-controlled  xxxd138xxx  studies, the mean
decrease in hemoglobin concentration was 0.8 g/dl, which
was comparable to the decrease observed with  xxxd358xxx 
treatment (0.9 g/dl). the mean hemoglobin concentration
decreased over the first 4 weeks for patients receiving
 xxxd138xxx  but stabilized by 4 – 12 weeks of treatment.
the cause of the decrease in hemoglobin is unknown, but it
does not seem to result from hemorrhage or hemolysis.
the development of testicular tubular atrophy and sterility has been linked to the chronic administration of eras
to rodents. testicular tubular atrophy was observed with
 xxxd138xxx  administration in repeat dose studies in rats

and mice; however, no testicular changes were observed in
dog studies at an exposure 35-fold greater than that seen in
humans based on auc [14]. a small number of male patients
underwent semen and male fertility hormone analyses in
 xxxd138xxx  clinical studies; however, there are currently
insufficient data to make definitive conclusions regarding
the effects of  xxxd138xxx  on male fertility.
teratogenicity is another effect of eras. the effect of
 xxxd138xxx  on embryo-fetal development has been assessed
in rats and rabbits after oral dose administration on gestation
days 6 – 17. in both species, abnormalities of the lower jaw,
tongue and/or palate were consistently observed at all
doses [14]. there are no published data on the use of  xxxd138xxx  in pregnant women.  xxxd138xxx  is classified as a category x drug by the fda and contraindicated in women who
are or may become pregnant while taking this drug [15].
in the first year of commercialization, post-marketing
reports of fluid retention occurring within weeks of starting
 xxxd138xxx  have been received; these require intervention
with a diuretic, hospitalization for fluid management or, in
some cases, hospitalization for decompensated heart
failure [15]. it is recommended that if clinically significant
fluid retention develops during therapy with  xxxd138xxx ,
further evaluation should be undertaken to determine the
cause and possible need for intervention. if patients
have preexisting fluid overload, this should be managed as
clinically appropriate before starting  xxxd138xxx .
2.2.7

regulatory affairs

 xxxd138xxx  is approved for marketing authorization in the
us under the trade name  xxxd138xxx , and in the eu, norway,
iceland, switzerland, canada and australia under the trade
name  xxxd138xxx ®. because of the risks of liver injury and birth
defects,  xxxd138xxx  ( xxxd138xxx ) in the us is only available
through a special restricted distribution program called the
 xxxd138xxx  education and access program (leap). monthly
monitoring of liver function is required. pregnancy must be
excluded before the initiation of  xxxd138xxx  treatment and prevented thereafter by the use of at least two reliable methods of
contraception. monthly pregnancy tests are required.  xxxd138xxx 
is available in the eu through a controlled distribution system
with similar liver function and pregnancy monitoring recommendations. patient/prescriber education is a key component
of the us and eu programs.
3.

conclusion

 xxxd138xxx , an eta-selective era, was first approved by
the fda on 15 june 2007 for the treatment of pah in
patients with who class ii or iii symptoms.  xxxd138xxx 
is a drug available for administration at 5 and 10 mg qd p.o.
efficacy of  xxxd138xxx  has been demonstrated through
significant improvement in exercise capacity and a delay in
the time to clinical worsening of pah. improvements in
who functional class, dyspnea, hemodynamics and qol

 xxxd138xxx 

have also been observed in clinical studies. substantial
decreases in bnp were observed following  xxxd138xxx 
treatment, which correlated with improvements in 6mwd
and who class. the durability of these improvements
seems to be maintained for ≥ 1 year of treatment.
the safety profile of  xxxd138xxx  includes headache, flushing, nasal congestion and peripheral edema as the most common aes. despite the relatively low annual rate of
aminotransferase elevations > 3 × uln, monthly monitoring
of lfts is still required or recommended, similar to  xxxd358xxx 
and  xxxd3207xxx . however,  xxxd138xxx  may be a treatment
option for patients who cannot tolerate  xxxd358xxx  or  xxxd3207xxx  owing to liver function abnormalities. like other eras,
 xxxd138xxx  is teratogenic and thus also requires monthly
pregnancy testing in all women of child bearing potential.
a valuable property of  xxxd138xxx  seems to be a lack of
clinically significant drug interactions, in particular with
warfarin and sildenafil, which are frequently used by patients
being treated for pah. overall,  xxxd138xxx  is a viable
treatment option for patients with pah.

expert opinion

the past decade has seen considerable advances in the treatment of pah, including fda approval of six medications,
the most recent being  xxxd138xxx , which is a propanoic
acid based, eta-selective era with once-daily dosing.
two doses of  xxxd138xxx  are marketed and both doses
have demonstrated efficacy in controlled trials. clinically
relevant improvements in mean 6mwd were observed for
 xxxd138xxx  5 mg qd in who class iii and pah-ctd
subgroups, some individual patients may experience greater

1856

benefits from higher doses. although no data are available
to support this, an increase to  xxxd138xxx  10 mg qd may
be an option for patients who experience an insufficient
response to treatment with the 5 mg qd dose.
in addition to once-daily administration,  xxxd138xxx  has
a very favorable liver profile and lack of significant drug
interactions. it also seems to be better tolerated in patients
who have failed either  xxxd358xxx  or  xxxd3207xxx  treatment
owing to liver function abnormalities. these potential advantages may be owing to the chemical structure and/or distinct
metabolism of this drug. as presented earlier,  xxxd138xxx 
shows a high selectivity for the  xxxg676xxx . while there
are theoretical advantages for selective inhibition of the type
a  xxxg676xxx  compared to dual receptor inhibition, the clinical data are less clear.
in its first year of commercial availability,  xxxd138xxx 
has been broadly prescribed.  xxxd358xxx , a dual-selective
era approval for who functional class iii and iv pah, has
been on the market for several years and has greater commercial experience. over the next decade it will be interesting
to observe how these two eras, and eras in general, are
positioned in the treatment guidelines and prescribed in
clinical practice. areas for further research include the longterm safety and efficacy of  xxxd138xxx  in combination with
other pah drugs, as well as studies of patients with pulmonary
hypertension owing to etiologies other that pah.
