abstract
dna vaccines have been effective at generating useful immune responses in many animal species. however, it is clearly desirable to
increase their potency. the identification of adjuvants that increase their cell-mediated immune (cmi) response is therefore an important
goal. resiquimod is an  xxxd2339xxx  analog proven to activate dendritic cells through tlr-7. the adjuvant capacity of resiquimod has not, to
our knowledge, been studied in the context of genetic immunization. here, we studied resiquimod as an adjuvant for plasmid vaccine therapy
by intra-muscular immunization of balb/c mice with hiv-1 gag dna vaccine without and with several concentrations of resiquimod
(ranging from 5–100 nm). we observed that resiquimod moderately enhanced ifn-␥ production as measured by a peptide-based elispot
assay compared to that obtained in mice immunized with dna gag only. antigen-specific t-cell proliferation studies showed a several-fold
increase in the stimulation index in mice immunized with dna gag +50 nm of resiquimod as compared to mice receiving dna gag
alone. antibody titer also increased, while the antibody isotyping data showed a strong th1 biased type response. analysis of cytokine
production in serum samples demonstrated a stronger th1 cytokine bias in the presence of resiquimod. furthermore, relevant increase in
il-4 production, as measured by elispot assay, was not observed. our results show that resiquimod can have modest adjuvant activity,
in a dna formulation, driving the immune system towards a cell-mediated immune response. additional studies involving this adjuvant
for dna vaccines are underway.

1. introduction
dna-based vaccination is an important and promising
alternative among several therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for hiv vaccination. it is characterized by being
immunogenic, safe, and is likely simple to produce [1–4].
in this approach, the host cell provides the post-translational
modifications to the antigen, allowing its production with
the correct native conformation to live infection [5]. in addition, there is little risk for a secondary infection, as the material injected is non-replicating and non-infectious [6–8].
furthermore, dna vaccines have been evaluated in clinical
trials, including both uninfected and hiv-1-infected individuals [9–11]. studies have demonstrated that dna vaccines can induce cell-mediated immune (cmi) responses,
a feature that is expected to improve immune containment
of hiv. for example, long-term non-progressors (ltnp)

are able to effectively control hiv replication [12]. they
are characterized as having a strong cmi response [13], a
feature that is thought to be important in their capacity to
contain viral replication.
although highly active anti-retroviral therapy (haart)
has been effective in increasing the life expectancy of
hiv-1-infected patients [14,15], this therapeutic regimen
produces several side effects, is expensive, and has not
been capable of eliminating the underlying viral infection
[15,16]. haart can limit the infection without viral clearance, [17–19]. in this regard, therapeutic vaccines can,
in theory, stimulate the immune system to actively attack
the virus, and possibly aid immune clearance. however, it
is likely that current vaccination strategies could stand to
have increased immune potency as well as strong th1-type
cellular immune bias.
antigen-specific immune responses can be amplified using specific adjuvants, which enhance the action of a particular vaccine regimen [20–23]. several vaccination strategies
have proposed the use of adjuvants for the enhancement
of a dna-induced immune response [20,24,25]. these can

m. otero et al. / vaccine 22 (2004) 1782–1790

be categorized into two groups, those adjuvants that enhance the dna delivery into cells, and therefore increase
the antigen expression, and those who actually enhance the
immune response by activating specific immunomodulatory
pathway [25]. in terms of immune-modulating adjuvants,
several approaches have been studied. both, chemical and
genetic adjuvants have been tested by several groups for
the antigen-mediated enhancement of the immune response
[26]. among the chemical adjuvants, aluminum salts and
mf59 have been widely used [27]. other chemical adjuvants, like lipopolysaccharide derived mpl, and the saponin
derivative qs21, have been evaluated as options for vaccine adjuvant applications [27]. the immune response for
mucosal directed vaccination have been enhanced by using
either non-toxic bacterial or viral derivatives that maintain
the adjuvanticity in the gut such as virosomes, or even toxic
biological derivatives such as cholera toxin [25,28,29].
genetic adjuvants, on the other hand, are genetically engineered molecules that are expressed in the host after immunization, encoding an immune-modulator molecule expected
to increase or direct the immunogenic capacity of the antigen
that is co-expressed as the dna vaccine. several approaches
have been used in the design of these types of adjuvants.
some of them have been designed so they are co-expressed
in the same vector with the antigen, either by a polycistronic
construct, in which both, the antigen and the adjuvant are
regulated by different promoters, or as fused molecules with
the antigen, regulated by the same promoter [30]. another
more common practice is to add the genetic adjuvant as a
cocktail of separate cloned constructs as part of the vaccine
preparation. in general these adjuvants exert their action by
their immunomodulatory effects, propitiating the generation
of an optimal cytokine milieu that drives the immune response towards the desired direction. the use of gm-csf,
il-1 fragments, il-2, il-4, il-12,  xxxg396xxx ,  xxxg398xxx , il-15 and
ifn-␥ among others have been successfully tested [31–33].
the use of cpg sequences as part of the genetic vaccine
has also been reported to enhance the immune response
[34].
various reports support that resiquimod, a chemical analog of  xxxd2339xxx , is a potent modulator of the immune
response [35,36]. specifically, it was demonstrated that resiquimod activates the innate immune system via tlr-7
through the activation of the  xxxg1489xxx  pathway in antigen
presenting cells, including dendritic cells [37].  xxxd2339xxx 
has effectively been used for the treatment of genital wards
[38] and has been proposed for the treatment of genital herpes [39,40]. however, its use as a vaccine adjuvant has not
been explored in detail and there have been no studies in the
dna vaccine area.
here, we show that resiquimod used as adjuvant in
combination with hiv dna plasmid vaccine through
intra-muscular vaccination, enhances hiv-1 gag-specific
immune responses. several concentrations of resiquimod
were utilized and delivered to mice by intra-muscular injection together with a plasmid dna encoding hiv-1 gag. we

found that resiquimod adjuvants the cell-mediated immune
response. specifically, our data showed moderate increases
in the frequency of antigen-specific ifn-␥ producing cells,
proliferative responses and the production of th1-type antibodies, compared to those obtained when no resiquimod
was used for immunization. these results indicate that
immune-modulators should be further studied as adjuvants
in the design of studies involving dna-based vaccine approaches. furthermore, improving on these modest gains
through different formulations is likely worthy of additional
investigation.
2. methods
2.1. mice
female 4–6-week-old balb/c mice were purchased from
the jackson laboratory, bar harbor, me. their care was in
accordance with the guidelines of the national institutes of
health (bethesda, md, usa) and the university of pennsylvania (philadelphia, pa, usa) institutional care and use
committee (iacuc).
2.2. study design
a total of seven groups, four mice in each, were used.
these groups included naı̈ve, backbone, dna gag, dna
gag mixed with 5, or 25, or 50 or 100 nm of resiquimod,
respectively. an additional group of mice was immunized
only with 50 nm of resiquimod (invivogen, san diego, ca),
without dna, was tested as a control. mice were immunized with three doses of 100 ␮g of hiv-1 p37gag dna
plasmid [41], or backbone at each immunization 2 weeks
apart. blood from both control and immunized mice was
obtained 1 week after the second and third immunizations,
respectively.
2.3. elispot
high-protein binding ip 96 well multiscreentm plates
(millipore, bedford, ma, usa) were used. plates were
coated with mab to mouse ifn-␥ or il-4 (r&d systems,
minneapolis, mn) diluted in pbs, overnight at 4 ◦ c. plates
were washed with pbs and then blocked for 2 h at room
temperature with pbs supplemented with 1% bsa and 5%
sucrose. mice splenocytes were added in triplicates at an
input cell number of 2 × 105 cells per well resuspended in
complete culture medium (rpmi 1640 supplemented with
10% fbs and antibiotics). a  xxxd924xxx  gag 15-mer overlapping
peptide library pool (obtained from nih aids research and
reference reagent program, rockville, md, usa), and p24
protein (protein sciences, meriden, ct) were used as antigens at a final concentration of 5 ␮g/ml, for specific stimulation of the ifn-␥ and the il-4 release. concavalin a
(sigma–aldrich, st. louis, mo), at 5 ␮g/ml, and complete

1784

m. otero et al. / vaccine 22 (2004) 1782–1790

culture medium were used as positive and negative control,
respectively. plates were washed after a 24 h (for ifn-␥) or
48 h (for il-4) incubation at 37 ◦ c, in a 5% co2 atmosphere
incubator. then, a biotinilated detector anti-mouse ifn-␥
was added, and plates were incubated overnight at 4 ◦ c. the
plates were washed, and color development was followed according to the manufacturer’s instructions (elispot blue
color module, r&d systems, minneapolis, mn). plates
were air-dried and the spots were counted using a stereomicroscope at a 40× magnification and an automated elispot
reader system (ctl analyzers, cleveland, oh) with the
immnunospot® software. the average number of spot forming cells (sfc) was adjusted to 1 × 106 splenocytes.
2.4. cd8+ t-cell depletion study
cd8 lymphocytes were depleted from splenocytes by
using immune-magnetic beads coated with antibodies to
cd8 (dynal biotech inc., lake success, ny) following manufacturer’s instructions. after depletion of cd8+
t-cells, ifn-␥ elispot assay was performed as described
above.
2.5. lymphocyte proliferation assay
spleen cells (2 × 105 per well) were cultured in triplicate in the presence of p24 protein (5 ␮g/ml), concavalin
a (5 ␮g/ml), and medium control. after 5–6 days, 1 ␮ci of
3 h labeled thymidyne was added per well and incubated for
16 h. thymidyne incorporation was measured in a wallac
␤-counter (serviced by perkin-elmer, downers grove, il).
the mean counts per minute was calculated for triplicates of
antigen, mitogen or the control medium. stimulation index
(si) was calculated by dividing the mean counts per minute
of antigen or mitogen by the mean counts per minute for
control medium. an si > 3 was defined as positive.
2.6. antibody determination
the measurement of igg antibodies specific for gag was
performed by elisa (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) in both immunized and control mice. maxisorp plates
(nalge nunc international, rochester, ny) were coated with
1 ␮g/ml of p24 protein (protein sciences, meriden, ct) and
incubated overnight at room temperature. after washing,
plates were blocked with 3% bsa in pbst for 1 h at 37 ◦ c.
then plates were washed again and incubated with the specific mouse sera, diluted in 3% bsa-pbst (pbs + 0.05%
tween) overnight at 4 ◦ c, followed by incubation with a
1/10,000 dilution of hrp-conjugated goat anti-mouse igg
(jackson immunoresearch, west grove, pa) for 1 h at
37 ◦ c. the reaction was developed with the substrate tmb
(3,3 ,5,5 -tetramethylbenzidine) (sigma–aldrich). plates
were washed several times after each incubation step. reaction was stopped with 100 ␮l of 2.5 m  xxxd3258xxx  per
well and the absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

2.7. igg subclass determination
a subclass specific elisa was carried out. the assay was performed as described above but using rabbit
hrp-conjugated anti-mouse igg2a or igg1 (research diagnostics inc., flanders, nj) as the secondary antibodies.
2.8. cytokine determination in serum samples
serum samples from all groups, collected after the second
and third immunizations, were assayed for the presence of
cytokines. the commercial mouse elisa kits used were:
il-12+ p40 and tnf-␣ (biosource international, camarillo, ca) and ifn-␣ (pbl biomedical laboratories, piscataway, nj). the procedures were performed following
manufacturer’s instructions.

3. results
3.1. hiv gag-specific  xxxg1141xxx  stimulation
we studied resiquimod as an adjuvant for the enhancement of the plasmid gag-specific immune responses. several
groups of mice were immunized with 100 ␮g of hiv-1 gag
dna construct in combination with several concentrations
of resiquimod, ranging from 0 to 100 nm. the plasmid final
formulation consisted of a 1.0 ␮g/␮l dna in sodium citrate
buffer and  xxxd383xxx . the cellular immune responses were
analyzed from the pool of splenocytes obtained from each
group of mice as described. the frequencies of gag-specific
t-cells producing ifn-␥ were measured by elispot.
splenocytes were stimulated with a pool of overlapping
peptides representing the entire sequence of the hiv-1 gag
protein.
the mean frequency of spot forming cells sfc per million
splenocytes was 140.0 ± 30.0, 170.0 ± 14.1, 235.0 ± 21.2,
and 267.5±10.6 for the dna gag, dna gag +25, dna gag
+50, and dna gag +100 nm of resiquimod, respectively.
a background level of ifn-␥ spots per million splenocytes
was detected on the samples obtained from naı̈ve or backbone immunized mice (fig. 1a). the sfc per million cells
increased more that 1.5-fold when dna gag +100 nm of
resiquimod was compared to dna gag alone, showing the
effect of resiquimod as an adjuvant. the same result was
obtained in the condition when dna gag +50 nm of resiquimod was compared to dna gag alone (fig. 1a). no
increase in the number of ifn-␥ spots among the groups
was observed when the p24 protein was used as the stimulatory antigen, which should drive the cd4+ t-cells in particular (fig. 1a). moreover, cd8+ t-cell depleted elispot
assay showed a remarkable decrease in the frequencies of
ifn-␥ producing cells (fig. 1b). for reasons stated below,
these depletion experiments were specifically performed on
samples from animals immunized with gag dna +50 nm

of resiquimod, and controls (fig. 1b). this data indicate the
specificity of the cd8+ t-cells in the gag-specific ifn-␥
release, showing that this response was enhanced by the adjuvant effects of resiquimod.
3.2. cytokine profiling
several cytokines are known to play a major role in the
driving force to a th1 versus a th2 immune response. on
this regard, il-4 is recognized as th2 biased, while il-12,
tnf-␣ and ifn-␣ are recognized as th1 biased immune
response. in addition, other reports have shown the effects
of resiquimod in the release of ifn-␣, tnf-␣ and il-12
[36]. we decided to evaluate the effect of resiquimod in the
cytokine release in the context of our immunization protocol
through the release of il-12.
we found high titers of il-12 in mouse serum after the
second boost (fig. 2). in these experiments, the il-12 concentration found in sera from mice immunized with dna

gag alone did not show a notable difference as compared to
that found in control mice (backbone or naı̈ves). however,
an increase in il-12 production was detected in the serum
samples derived from mice immunized with dna gag plus
resiquimod (fig. 2). in these cases, sera from animals immunized with gag +50 nm resiquimod showed production of
81.41 pg/ml of il-12, which is a 2.4 increase in the amount
of il-12 as compared to that obtained from mice immunized with dna gag alone. moreover, samples from mice
immunized with dna gag +25 nm of resiquimod showed
a production of 64.61 pg/ml of il-12, a two-fold increase
as compared to mice immunized with dna gag without resiquimod. samples from mice immunized with dna gag
+5 nm of resiquimod did not show a relevant increase in the
production of il-12 as compared to either dna gag alone
or the control groups.
these results show the efficacy of resiquimod as an adjuvant in the stimulation of the th1 relevant cytokines. importantly, no increase in il-12 was observed in control animals

naı̈ve and backbone immunized mice were included as control. a total of four mice per group were immunized three times, 2 weeks apart, via
intramuscular injection. serum of every group, taken 1 week after the second and third immunization, was pooled and analyzed for the presence of il-12
by a commercial available kit. experiments represent the mean value of three experiments.

immunized with resiquimod alone (data not shown), illustrating the linkage of this response to the presence of antigen.
we decided to perform the rest of the experiments with the
condition of 50 nm of resiquimod, as it has been the optimal
for the ifn-␥ elispot data and for this il-12 assay itself.
furthermore, other groups successfully reported the use of
this dose in mice [37].
we measured the frequencies of gag-specific t-cells producing il-4 by elispot assay with the same conditions
used for the ifn-␥ elispot assay. our data showed no
relevant increase in il-4 production on any of the mice in
this study (fig. 3). moreover, there was no substantial difference in the il-4 production in the groups immunized with
gag dna +50 nm of resiquimod and any of the controls.
as stated above, a similar result was observed in the cd8+
t-cell depleted elispot assay (fig. 1b), in which no substantial difference was detected in the vaccinated animals
as compared to the controls. this information supports the
th1 bias of this immune response, however some additional
experiments were performed to confirm this result.
3.3. antigen-specific t-cell proliferation
antigen-specific t-cell proliferation is also a relevant
parameter in the characterization of cellular immune responses. the t-cell proliferative assays were performed in
which the incorporation of 3 h thymidyne was measured in
splenocytes from each group of mice, after their stimulation
with hiv-1 gag protein. resiquimod-induced reasonable
antigen-specific proliferation of cd4+ t-cells (fig. 4).
specifically, the si substantially increased in mice immunized with dna gag +50 nm of resiquimod as compared to

the si values obtained from dna gag alone as well as naı̈ve
and backbone groups. in this case, a seven-fold increase
was observed, as compared with the dna gag-vaccinated
mice in whom no resiquimod was used (fig. 4).
3.4. humoral responses
we examined the adjuvant effects of resiquimod in the
context of the humoral immune responses. a gag protein
elisa was used to measure the igg gag-specific immune
responses. we observed a substantial increase in the humoral
immune response in the mice immunized with dna gag
+50 nm of resiquimod (fig. 5) used as adjuvant, as compared to the other groups. specifically, a five-fold increase
in the antibody production was observed in the sample taken
after the first boost in the group immunized with gag dna
+50 nm of resiquimod as compared to the same immunization time-point on animals immunized with dna gag without resiquimod (fig. 5). in addition, a two-fold increase was
observed as compared to animals immunized with dna gag
without resiquimod, for the serum samples collected after
the second boost on the same immunization condition (that
is, dna gag +50 nm of resiquimod).
3.5. antibody isotyping
antibody isotyping is an important tool for the elucidation of the type of immune response obtained after an infection or a vaccination regimen. it has been found that a
high igg2a/igg1 ratio on mice implies a strong bias towards
a th1-type response. serum samples from each group of
mice were analyzed specifically for the presence of igg2a

and igg1 antibodies. our data showed igg2a/igg1 antibody
ratios higher than one (1.00) for each sample (fig. 6). in
this experiment, the highest igg2a/igg1 gag-specific antibody ratio was 3.6, and it was found on the serum obtained
after the first boost from mice immunized with dna gag

+50 nm of resiquimod. the ratio for the samples taken after the second boost at the same immunization condition
showed an igg2a/igg1 ratio of 2.2. this information confirms our hypotheses of a resiquimod biased th1 immune
response.

2 weeks apart, via intramuscular injection. splenocytes of each group were pooled and stimulated with hiv-1 p24 protein. t-cell proliferative studies

4. discussion
the use of adjuvants in vaccine development have been
an important focus of improving vaccine responses. in this
study, we examine the use of resiquimod as an adjuvant for
hiv-1 gag dna-based vaccination protocol. resiquimod
has a chemical analog,  xxxd2339xxx , which is being used as
an effective medication against genital ward [38]. it has also
been proposed as a possible treatment for herpes virus infections [39,40]. several studies demonstrate that it exerts its
action through the activation of the innate immune system,
specifically the tlr-7 receptor on dc [37]. several reports
showed that resiquimod is a potent activator of the immune
response for the production of th1-type cytokines in vivo
through this pathway [35–37].
in the present study, we investigated the role of resiquimod
as an adjuvant in the hiv-1 gag-mediated immune response.
this study shows that resiquimod is a moderate adjuvant for
the hiv-1 plasmid gag-specific cellular mediated immune
response induced by intra-muscular injection. samples from
animals immunized with dna gag + resiquimod showed

an increase in the antigen-specific ifn-␥ elispot assay,
as compared to the samples obtained from mice immunized
with dna gag alone. cd8+ depleted samples and p24 stimulated cells, showed no production of ifn-␥ as compared
to the non-depleted gag-peptide stimulated samples. moreover, il-4 elispot data showed no substantial difference
between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted samples. this data
supports that resiquimod exerts a th1 biased adjuvant effect,
as the ifn-␥ release in these experiments was principally
mediated by cd8+ t-cells.
il-12 is a cytokine with a critical role in the th1-mediated
immune response. we speculated that we may observe elevation of this immune-modulator in the serum of vaccinated
animals. interestingly resiquimod + gag dna vaccine directed the production of il-12, in a dose-dependent manner
a week after the second boost. both, resiquimod and antigen
plasmid were required for this effect, suggesting an interface
between the innate and adaptive immune responses is necessary for the th1 boost. a downtrend in the dose-response
of the resiquimod-directed il-12 production was observed
as the titers of il-12 decreased with respect to the decrease

fig. 6. antibody igg2a/igg1 isotyping after dna vaccination using 100 ␮g of hiv-1 gag p37 alone and with 50 nm of resiquimod as adjuvant. naı̈ve
and backbone immunized mice were included as control. a total of four mice per group were immunized three times, 2 weeks apart, via intramuscular
injection. serum of each group, taken 1 week after the second and third immunization, was pooled and incubated with p24 protein in order to measure
the anti-gag specific humoral response. experiments represent the mean values of three independent experiments.

in the amount of resiquimod used for immunization, showing the dose-dependent action of resiquimod. this information supports the vaccine titration (fig. 1), where dna
gag +50 nm of resiquimod also showed the highest ifn-␥,
elispot responses.
we also observed that resiquimod enhances antigenspecific proliferation of t-cells. this adjuvant can effect
cd4+ t-cells, an important aspect for an effective immune
response. further examination of the humoral response
supports that the immune bias induced was th1 mediated.
we observed an increase in antibody production of the
humoral immune response in dna gag +resiquimod immunized mice as compared to the dna gag only immunized
mice. however, the antibody isotyping favors a th1 bias immune response, as the igg2a/igg ratios are higher than one.
this trend is not surprising as resiquimod is expected to induce a cellular immune response over a humoral one. this
is an important finding, as an important vaccine goal is to
drive the immune response towards a cmi pathway while,
at the same time, keep a decent humoral immune response.
the isotype observed supports this notion.
one issue with dna vaccine formulation is keeping potential adjuvants and the dna in proximity. dna delivery
results in protein antigen expression on after several hours
and can persists for days, a time period where normally the
water soluble resiquimod, could be long gone and unable
to play a role in local adjuvanticity. in this regard, we formulated resiquimod in  xxxd383xxx , which forms specific

complexes with dna. this formulation serves to increase
transfectant dna protection as well as local delivery [42].
these studies establish that resiquimod, in a similar fashion to other adjuvants for dna vaccines, can modestly boost
immune responses in vivo. recent studies using cytokines
or costimulatory molecules as plasmid encoding adjuvants
have generated an increase in either cellular or humoral immunity [43–50].
we are currently exploring use of these agents in combination with resiquimod to determine if there is synergy
in this approach. subsequent studies of such adjuvants will
likely be important for further improvement of immune potency of dna vaccines.
