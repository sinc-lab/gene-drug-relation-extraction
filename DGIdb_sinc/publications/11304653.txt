impaired activation of the fibrinolytic system in children
with henoch-schönlein purpura: beneficial effect of
hydrocortisone plus ⌺- xxxd146xxx  therapy on
disappearance rate of cutaneous vasculitis
and fibrinolysis
joseph prandota,1* lidia pankow-prandota,2 and leszek kotecki1

systemic vasculitis is a predominant clinical symptom in henoch-schönlein purpura (hsp), and some
studies suggested that decreased blood fibrinolytic activity, as well as blood platelets, is of importance
in the development of cutaneous vasculitis. although patients with hsp have normal blood coagulation, little is known about the fibrinolytic system. on the other hand, it is known that the focus of
⌺- xxxd146xxx  ( xxxd146xxx ) activity in vivo is probably the blood platelet–vessel wall interaction or a
vascular component alone. the aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate blood coagulation and
fibrinolytic system as well as the effect of hydrocortisone (h) plus  xxxd146xxx  therapy (group i) on plasma
 xxxg2056xxx  (at-iii), ␣1-proteinase inhibitor (␣1-pi), ␣2-antiplasmin (␣2-a), ␣2-macroglobulin (␣2m) activity, fibrinogen and plasminogen concentrations in plasma, euglobulin clot lysis time (elt), and
disappearance rate of cutaneous vasculitis in 14 children with hsp aged 7.6 ± 3.1 (sd) years. ten
patients (8.6 ± 2.5 years old) were treated with h alone (group ii), and 8 healthy, age-matched children
served as controls. plasma proteinase inhibitor activity was estimated with the kinetic method using
boehringer chromozyme tests before administration of h (9.2 ± 3.3 mg/kg/d, i.v.) plus  xxxd146xxx  (140 ± 52
mg/kg/d, p.o.) for 5.93 ± 2.05 days, and 24 hours after the last dose of  xxxd146xxx , as well as before and after
treatment with h alone (8.25 ± 1.74 mg/kg/24 h, i.v.) for 7.1 ± 1.2 days. it was found that patients with
hsp had the initial fibrinogen and plasminogen plasma concentrations significantly increased compared with the controls (group i: 3.93 ± 1.3 g/l and 124 ± 38%; group ii: 4.24 ± 0.89 g/l and 134 ± 42%
vs. 2.96 ± 0.34 g/l, and 90 ± 14%, respectively). also, there was a marked decrease of the initial plasma
␣2-a activity in group ii compared with the controls (0.69 ± 0.29 vs. 0.94 ± 0.11 iu/ml, respectively,
t = 2.33, p < .045). both treatment regimens significantly improved fibrinolysis, which manifested as a
shortening of elt, but the mean values of this parameter remained within normal range. after treatment with h plus  xxxd146xxx , the skin lesions started to disappear significantly faster compared with the h
alone regimen (2.28 ± 0.45 days vs. 4.12 ± 1.05, t = 4.41, p < .0023). in four of six patients receiving h plus
 xxxd146xxx  therapy, an approximately 20% decrease of systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure lasting
for 5 to 7 hours after administration of  xxxd146xxx  was observed. these results may suggest that children
with hsp have impaired plasma fibrinolytic activity and that an increased release of plasminogen
activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1) might be, at least in part, responsible for this phenomenon. concomitant
use of h (∼10 mg/kg/d) plus  xxxd146xxx  (∼100 mg/kg/d) for a few days opens new therapeutic possibilities
in some children with hsp.

introduction
henoch-schönlein purpura (hsp) is an immunologically mediated acute systemic necrotizing vasculitis of
small blood vessels primarily involving the skin, gastrointestinal tract, joints, kidneys, and other organ
and/or periorgan tissues.1,2 it is characterized by infiltration by polymorphonuclear leukocytes within
and around the smallest blood vessels, iga deposits in
glomerular mesangium and skin vessel walls, and
occasionally thrombosis.2–4 microbial agents have
been suggested to be responsible for the development
of hsp and the production of igg-antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies, which can induce respiratory
burst and degranulation of neutrophils and injure
the endothelial cells in vitro.1,5 the bleeding and fibrin deposition observed in hsp are believed to be
caused by a decrease in factor xiii (fibrin-stabilizing
factor).6,7 other factors reported to be involved in the
pathogenesis of hsp include an increase in tumor
necrosis factor ␣ (tnf-␣)8 and transforming growth
factor ␣,9 and a decrease in prostaglandin i2 synthesis.10 the above-cited laboratory data and leukocyamerican journal of therapeutics (2001) 8(1)

toclastic vasculitis, a predominant clinical symptom
of hsp, may suggest that blood platelets play an important role in the pathophysiology of this clinical entity.
cutaneous vasculitis has also been reported in patients with ␣1-proteinase inhibitor (␣1-pi) deficiency,
including those with hsp,2,3,11–13 and cunliffe et al14
suggested that decreased blood fibrinolytic activity is
of importance in the development of this abnormality.
although patients with hsp have normal blood coagulation,3 little is known about the fibrinolytic system. previously, we demonstrated a beneficial effect of
prednisone plus ⌺- xxxd146xxx  ( xxxd146xxx ) treatment regimen on some plasma proteinase inhibitor
activity (including that of ␣1-pi) and the clinical
course in children with frequently relapsing prednisone-responsive nephrotic syndrome.15,16 also, it is
known that the focus of  xxxd146xxx  activity in vivo is probably the blood platelet–vessel wall interaction or a
vascular component alone, and supranormal levels of
fibrinolytic activity were observed within 72 hours
of stopping the drug.17 because prednisone prophylaxis is routinely given to all patients with hsp who

and h alone on some plasma proteinase inhibitor activity, and the rate of disappearance of cutaneous vasculitis.

patients and methods
patients
the patients were enrolled consecutively as they were
admitted to the hospital and placed into one of two
groups. group i consisted of 14 hsp children, 3.5 to
12.5 years old (mean age, 7.6 ± 3.1), who were treated

with h plus  xxxd146xxx  (table 1). group ii included 10
patients, 5.5 to 12 years old (mean age, 8.6 ± 2.5), who
were receiving h alone (table 2). a presumptive diagnosis of hsp had been made in each patient because
of the typical history, characteristic skin lesions, and
clinical course.3
eight healthy children, 3.5 to 18 years old (mean
age, 7 years; four boys and four girls), served as controls.
neither study group was confined to bed during the
investigation.
blood collection
blood was taken on admission to the hospital and 24
hours after the last dose of h plus  xxxd146xxx  (group i), ie,
after 5.93 ± 2.05 days and 7.1 ± 1.2 days after the
administration of h alone (group ii).
plasma was obtained by collecting 4.5 ml of a

fibrinolytic system in henoch-schönlein purpura

because the patients with nephrotic syndrome who
have received treatment with  xxxd146xxx  (plus prednisone)
had hypotension lasting a few hours,15,16 the arterial
blood pressure was also measured in children with
hsp in the recumbent position before and 0.5, l, 2, 3, 4,
5, and 6 hours after  xxxd146xxx  administration.
drug administration
h was administered intravenously in the mean dose
9.2 ± 3.3 mg/kg/24 h (range, 4.8–18 mg/kg/24 h) for
5.93 ± 2.05 days (range, 1–10 days) in group i and 8.25
± 1.74 mg/kg/24 h (range, 4.8–10.5 mg/kg/24 h) for
7.1 ± 1.2 days (range, 5–9 days) in group ii. h was
used because it has short biological plasma half-life
and exerts less suppressive effect on pituitary-adrenal
function than other corticosteroids.
 xxxd146xxx  (ziololek, poznan, poland) was given orally
as 50% granulate at 8:00 and 11:00 am and 2:00, 5:00,
and 8:00 pm, in a mean dose of 140 ± 52 mg/kg/d
(range, 89–216 mg/kg/d) for 1 to 10 days (5.93 ± 2.05
days) in group i. such widely differing  xxxd146xxx  daily
doses were used for different times because this drug
was being used in children with hsp for the first time
and we wanted to establish the lowest effective dose
range and time of administration that would not affect
systemic fibrinolysis of the patients. longer than 10
days’ use of  xxxd146xxx  in the patients appeared to be not
necessary.

statistics
a student t test for nonpaired data was used to compare the results obtained before and after h plus
 xxxd146xxx  and h alone administration. the correlation
coefficients were calculated by the method of least
squares. p values <.05 were regarded as significant.
the results are presented as means ± sd. the study
conformed to the helsinki declaration and was approved by the medical school ethics committee.

results
group i (h +  xxxd146xxx )
the mean plasma proteinase inhibitor activity and
blood coagulation and fibrinolysis tests in group i are
presented in table 3.
four of 14 patients had initial plasma at-iii activity
markedly diminished by an average 41% (range, 11.2–
17.1 iu/ml) and 6 of 14 had this activity increased by
45%, but the mean value of this parameter did not
differ significantly compared with the controls (21.9 ±
2.46 iu/ml).
five of 14 patients had the initial plasma ␣2-a activity markedly decreased by approximately 56% (0.18
to 0.56 iu/ml), and in 5 of 14 children the ␣1-pi activity was diminished by 36% (0.82 to 1.61 iu/ml),

but the mean values of these parameters did not differ
significantly compared with the respective controls
(0.94 ± 0.11 iu/ml and 1.97 ± 0.34 iu/ml).
one patient in group i had plasma ␣2-m activity
markedly diminished to 4.06 iu/ml.
the initial mean plasma fibrinogen and plasminogen concentrations were significantly increased compared with the respective control values (t = 2.58, p <
.027; t = 2.82, p < .0156). the h +  xxxd146xxx  treatment did
not affect plasminogen concentration in plasma, but
the mean concentration of fibrinogen decreased significantly compared with controls (t = 2.96, p < .011),
reaching normal range.
in both groups of patients, the initial mean elt was
similar to the control value. after treatment with h +
 xxxd146xxx  or h alone, the values of this parameter shortened significantly (group i: t = 2.39, p < .026; group ii:
t = 2.5, p < .022), but remained within normal range
(table 3).
group ii (h alone)
three of 10 children of group ii had the initial plasma
at-iii activity markedly diminished by approximately 53% (range, 9.56–11.5 iu/ml) and 7 of 10 patients had this activity increased by 54% (29 to 46 iu/
ml), but the mean value of this parameter did not
differ significantly compared with the controls (21.9 ±
2.46 iu/ml) (table 3). the treatment with h alone
resulted in a marked increase of the mean activity of
this parameter compared with the control value (t =
3.18, p < .011).
the initial mean plasma ␣2-a activity of the patients
was found to be significantly decreased compared
with controls (0.69 ± 0.29 vs. 0.94 ± 0.11, t = 2.33, p <
.045).
as in group i, the initial mean plasma fibrinogen
and plasminogen concentrations were found to be
markedly increased compared with the respective
controls. after treatment with h alone, the plasma
fibrinogen concentration decreased significantly
reaching normal range.
clinical efficacy
after treatment with the h +  xxxd146xxx  regimen, the skin
lesions started to disappear after 2.28 ± 0.45 days compared with 4.12 ± 1.05 days observed in group ii
treated with h alone (t = 4.41, p < .0023). in patients 1,
7, and 8 (table 2), the treatment with h alone did not
affect the disappearance rate of their skin vasculitis.
however, 2 days after the addition of  xxxd146xxx  to this
treatment regimen, the skin changes started to disappear. on the other hand, in patient 9 (table 1), the skin
purpura disappeared after 3 days of treatment with h

in group i (patients 1–6). it was found that 30 to 60
minutes after administration of  xxxd146xxx , four children
(patients 3–6) had an approximately 20% decrease in
systolic and diastolic blood pressure that lasted for 5
to 7 hours. no other side effects or complaints were
noted in children receiving this treatment regimen.

discussion
our study showed that the children with hsp had a
significantly increased plasma concentrations of plasminogen and fibrinogen compared with the controls,
and 15 of 24 patients had markedly decreased plasma
␣2-a activity. these data may suggest that there is an
impairment of activation of the fibrinolytic system in
this clinical entity and that this abnormality may be
caused, at least in part, by an increased activity of
 xxxg2058xxx  (pai-1).22–25
in our children and in other patients with hsp,5 the
disease has usually been preceded and/or accompanied by infection(s) that cause activation of vascular
endothelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts; increase production and release of “acute phase” cytokines, such as interleukin (il) 1 (il-1), il-6, tnf, interferon, and “acute phase” proteins 26,27 such as fibrinogen, and pai-122–25,28,29; and increase the serum
concentration of glucocorticosteroids.26 this excess of
serum glucocorticosteroids moderates the production
of the plasminogen activator in leukocytes that converts plasminogen to plasmin30 and also stimulates
pai-1 synthesis.28 in addition, monocytes/macrophages synthesize pai-228 and also release il-1 and
il-6, as well as tnf,28,31,32 which cause a decrease of
production of plasminogen activator and increase
pai-1 release from vascular endothelial cells.28,33–35
the above-cited physiopathological events may explain a markedly increased concentration of plasminogen in plasma found in our children with hsp. an
increase in tnf-␣ and il-6 has also been reported in
the serum of hsp patients.8 moreover, these patients
were shown to have an increase in transforming
growth factor ␣,9 and it is known that the transforming growth factor ␤ and platelet-derived growth factor
released from blood platelets increase pai-1 synthesis
by the endothelial cells.36,37 the above reasoning is

fibrinolytic system in henoch-schönlein purpura

supported by the recent study of besbas et al38 who
reported increased plasma levels of pai-1, tissue-type
plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx ), and  xxxg2277xxx  in
children with hsp. the increased level of pai-1 may
critically affect fibrinolysis in these patients because
the stable complex formation rate of this inhibitor with
 xxxg1766xxx ,  xxxg1767xxx  ( xxxg1767xxx ),
and two-chain  xxxg1766xxx  is described as k = 107m−1s−1,
which for pai-1 is a few orders of magnitude higher
than that for other inhibitors, such as  xxxg2053xxx , protease
nexin, ␣2-macroglobulin, c⬘1-esterase, and ␣2-antiplasmin (k = 100 − 105m−1s−1). moreover, the plasma
 xxxg1766xxx  concentration is 70 pmol/l and its biological
half-life is a few minutes, whereas the respective values for pai-1 are 1 nmol/l and 2 to 3 hours (in vitro,
37°c).28 it is, therefore, not surprising that the increased plasma concentrations of  xxxg2277xxx 
(receptor for thrombin and cofactor of protein c,
which stimulates fibrinolysis by inactivating pai-123)
and  xxxg1766xxx  reported by besbas et al,38 being a response
of the body to the impaired fibrinolysis in children
with hsp, appeared not to be effective in improving of
this abnormality.
it appears that there is no impairment of urokinase
activity in children with hsp because the treatment
with h plus  xxxd146xxx  did not affect the concentration of
plasminogen in plasma and otherwise it is known that
the rate of glu = plasminogen activation by urokinase
increased by 10- to 20-fold in the presence of
 xxxd146xxx .24,39
our patients had hyperfibrinogenemia, which is one
of a few important plasma factors that may cause
platelet hyperaggregability.40,41 also, it is known that
patients with hsp may have irregularities in blood
flow dynamics because of vasculitis of the smallest
blood vessels, most commonly on the lower extremities where the hydrodynamic forces are the greatest.2
since the blood flow rate is the main determinant of in
vivo platelet–vessel wall interaction,42 the platelets
would tend to accumulate at these points and might
then release a vasoactive agent(s) (possibly serotonin,
which would participate in the development of skin
purpura2) and ␣2-a,43 as well as pai-1,29 which is also
released from endothelial cells of vessel walls during
venous stasis.22,44
treatment with h alone improved fibrinolysis in
our patients, which manifested as a statistically significant shortening of elt, although the mean value of
this parameter remained within normal range. a similar effect was observed after h plus  xxxd146xxx  therapy.
this is an important finding because it indicates that
the doses of  xxxd146xxx  administered concomitantly with
h had no unfavorable effect on systemic fibrinolysis.
also, this is in agreement with green et al17 who ob-

17

served supranormal levels of fibrinolytic activity
within 72 hours of stopping the drug. cunliffe et al14
showed that in adults with skin vasculitis, the use of
phenphormin and ethylestrenol also resulted in an increase in blood fibrinolytic activity and improvement
of the skin changes. it is known, however, that both of
these drugs also decrease platelets aggregation45 and
that the platelet pool of pai-1 is four- to sixfold greater
than that of plasma.22,25,28,29,46 therefore, one cannot
exclude that the increase in blood fibrinolytic activity
found by cunliffe et al14 resulted from a decreased
pai-1 release from blood platelets. thus, the beneficial
effect of h plus  xxxd146xxx  treatment regimen on the disappearance rate of cutaneous vasculitis observed in
our patients could also be the result of an inhibition of
blood platelet aggregation17 and, therefore, a possible
decrease in excessive pai-1 release from these cells. it
should be added that in vitro  xxxd146xxx  inhibited  xxxd80xxx – and collagen-induced platelet aggregation and the release of platelet  xxxd83xxx  and serotonin,17 ie, the substances known
to be endogenous mediators of platelet activation,41
and it is known that the pgi2 synthesis (the substance
known to inhibit platelet activation) was found to be
decreased in hsp patients.10
blood platelets are also a source of thrombospondin
(the protein released from alpha bodies of platelets)
that form a complex with plasminogen and inhibit its
conversion to plasmin (plasminogen in this complex is
not sensitive to  xxxg1766xxx ).22,47 because it was reported that
 xxxd146xxx  is blocking formation of this complex,47 the
above mechanism cannot be responsible for the increased concentration of plasminogen in plasma
found in our children with hsp after treatment with h
plus  xxxd146xxx .
the cutaneous vasculitis has been observed also in
patients with ␣1-pi deficiency,11–13 and it is known
that this plasma proteinase inhibitor plays an important role in the regulation of immunologic and inflammatory reactions.48,49 moreover, besides of ␣1-pi,
which is the most important inhibitor of plasmin,  xxxg2056xxx  and ␣2-m also have the capacity to inhibit plasmin
in vivo.28,50 although several of our patients had
plasma ␣1-pi and at-iii activity markedly decreased,
the mean initial activities of these two inhibitors were
within normal range.
in summary, our study showed that the children
with hsp have markedly increased concentrations of
fibrinogen and plasminogen in plasma, and more than
half of them had decreased plasma ␣2-a activity.
these changes may suggest that there is an impaired
activation of the fibrinolytic system in this clinical entity and that pai-1 may be, at least in part, responsible
for this abnormality. the treatment of these patients

with h plus  xxxd146xxx  resulted in a significantly faster
disappearance rate of the cutaneous vasculitis compared with children receiving h alone and exerted a
beneficial effect on fibrinolysis similar to that with h
alone.
