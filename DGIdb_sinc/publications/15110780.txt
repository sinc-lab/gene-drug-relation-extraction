abstract
communication between receptor  xxxg2198xxx  and  xxxg676xxx   xxxg1336xxx  (gpcr)-mediated signaling is recognized as a
common integrator linking diverse aspects of intracellular signaling systems. here, we report that g protein-coupled b-adrenergic
receptor activation leading to stimulation of salivary phospholipid release occurs with the involvement of  xxxg681xxx 
receptor (egfr). using sublingual gland acinar cells, we show that prosecretory eﬀect of  xxxd2401xxx  on phospholipid release was
subjected to suppression by egfr kinase inhibitor, pd153035, and  xxxd3536xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg1751xxx , but not by  xxxd1169xxx , an
inhibitor of extracellular signal regulated kinase (erk). furthermore,  xxxd3536xxx , but not the erk inhibitor, caused the reduction
in the acinar cell secretory responses to b-adrenergic agonist-generated camp as well as  xxxg67xxx  activator,  xxxd1742xxx . the
acinar cell phospholipid secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx , moreover, were inhibited by  xxxd1307xxx , a selective inhibitor of tyrosine
kinase src responsible for ligand-independent egfr phosphorylation. taken together, our data are the ﬁrst to demonstrate the
requirement for src kinase-dependent egfr transactivation in regulation of salivary phospholipid secretion in response to
b-adrenergic gpcr activation.

among the components of salivary gland secretions
recognized of importance to a variety of functional
properties of saliva, including the maintenance of soft
and hard oral tissue integrity, are lipids [1]. the elevated
levels of lipids in saliva are associated with the high
incidence of caries, and the development of plaque,
calculus, and periodontal disease [2]. the lipids of saliva
are known to aﬀect the penetration of oral mucosa by
lipophilic substances, alter the interaction of salivary
proteins with calcium, and inﬂuence the extent of glycosyltransferase activity associated with cariogenic potential of bacteria [1,2]. moreover, salivary lipids, and
phospholipids in particular, readily enter into heterotypic interaction with proteins and glycoproteins of saliva to form a dynamic continuum that determines many
physicochemical and biological properties of saliva [1,3].

included among these are viscoelastic and lubricative
properties, proteolytic susceptibility, and the formation
of the protective coatings covering tooth enamel and
oral mucosa [3,4].
considerably less is known about the factors regulating the level of lipids in saliva, although the control of
salivary secretion is mainly derived through neural, paracrine, and endocrine systems [5,6]. the parasympathetic
nerve stimulation leads mainly to increase in salivary
ﬂuid secretion, while sympathetic nerve stimulation affects the secretion of macromolecular constituents of
saliva [6]. indeed, studies show that acinar cells of salivary glands respond to camp-mediated b-adrenergic
agonists with increase in protein and mucin secretion [6],
and previous work from our laboratory revealed that
sublingual gland cells in culture respond to  xxxd2401xxx 
stimulation by the increase in phospholipid release [7].
while it is well recognized that the cellular eﬀects of
g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) that respond to

b-adrenergic stimulation are mediated by the generation
of camp and subsequent  xxxg1836xxx  (pka) activation, more recent data indicate that gpcr agonists,
such as  xxxd2401xxx  and  xxxg2417xxx 
(vip), also have the ability to induce the activation of
receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth
factor receptor (egfr) [8–10]. this ligand-independent
egfr activation, referred to as egfr transactivation,
involves selective phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues that are not autophosphorylation sites associated
with egf stimulation [9]. moreover, studies reporting
on gpcr activation of egfr phosphorylation point to
the involvement of src kinase in this signaling process
[8,11,12]. thus, egfr transactivation is emerging as a
central integrator in regulation of cellular responses
induced by gpcr agonists in epithelial cells.
in the present study, using acinar cells of rat sublingual gland, we have investigated the role of egfr
transactivation in regulation of salivary phospholipid
secretion in response to b-adrenergic agonist,  xxxd2401xxx . the data we present identify src kinase-dependent
egfr transactivation as a key factor in salivary
phospholipid elaboration.

materials and methods
sublingual gland acinar cell isolation and phospholipid labeling.
freshly dissected rat sublingual salivary gland was trimmed of fat and
connective tissue, cut into small dices, and minced by passage through a
50 mesh metal grid [7]. the minced tissue was suspended in 5 volumes
dulbecco’s modiﬁed (gibco) eagle’s minimal essential medium
(dmem), supplemented with  xxxd164xxx  (50 lg/ml), penicillin (50 u/
ml), streptomycin (50 lg/ml), and 2% albumin, and dispersed into single
cells by trituration with a glass homogenizer, and settled by centrifugation [7]. following rinsing, the cells were resuspended in the medium
to a concentration of 5  105 cell/ml, transferred in 1 ml aliquots to
dmem in culture dishes containing [14 c]choline (20 lci/ml), and incubated for 3 h under 95% o2 /5% co2 atmosphere at 37 °c [13]. the
cells were then centrifuged at 300g for 5 min, washed three times with
dmem containing 5% albumin to remove free radiolabel, and resuspended in a fresh dmem free of albumin.
cell incubation. to assess the eﬀect of b-adrenergic agonist on the
acinar cells phospholipid secretory responses, the cells were preincubated for 20 min either with saline diluent or indicated concentrations
of b-adrenergic antagonist,  xxxd123xxx  (sigma), followed by 30 min
incubation with 0–15 lm  xxxd2401xxx  (sigma). in the experiments on
the eﬀect of  xxxd1256xxx , pd153035 (calbiochem),  xxxg1369xxx /2 inhibitor,  xxxd1169xxx  (calbiochem),  xxxg1751xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd3536xxx  (sigma),
and src kinase selective inhibitor,  xxxd1307xxx  and its inactive analog, pp3
(calbiochem), the cells prior to addition of the  xxxd2401xxx  were ﬁrst
incubated for 20 min with the indicated concentration of the agent. the
eﬀects of dibutyryl-camp (sigma) and  xxxd1742xxx  (sigma) were assessed
following 20 min preincubation with  xxxd3536xxx  or saline diluent. at
the end of incubation period, the cells were centrifuged at 300g for
5 min and washed three times with fresh medium. the medium and
washes were combined and used for the isolation of [14 c]choline
labeled phospholipids.
cell viability. cell preparations before and during the experimentation were assessed for viability and cellular integrity using trypan
blue uptake assay and the determination of lactate dehydrogenase
released into the medium [13].

phospholipid analysis. extraction of lipids from the combined cell
wash and incubation medium was performed with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) [7]. the extracts were ﬁltered through a grade f sintered
glass funnel, and the lipids contained in the ﬁltrates were dried under
stream of nitrogen. the lipids contained in the residue were dissolved
in a small volume of chloroform, applied to silicic acid column, and
separated into neutral lipid, glycolipid, and phospholipid fractions [7].
aliquots of phospholipid fraction, eluted from the columns with
methanol, were subjected to analysis for [14 c]choline labeled phospholipids by scintillation spectrometry, while the remainder was used
for individual phospholipid analysis by thin-layer chromatography.
following two consecutive developments in chloroform/methanol/
water (80:35:5, by vol.), the plates were scanned for individual
[14 c]choline-containing phospholipids using berthold digital
autoradiograph analyzer.
data analysis. all experiments were carried out using duplicate
sampling and the results are expressed as means  sd. analysis of
variance (anova) was used to determine signiﬁcance and the
signiﬁcance level was set at p > 0:05.

results
the mechanism underlying b-adrenergic agonist activated release of salivary phospholipids was investigated using [14 c]choline-labeled acinar cells of rat
sublingual salivary glands exposed to  xxxd2401xxx .
under the employed incubation conditions, the cell viability remained over 98% with little if any (0.5–0.7%)
cellular damage, and the label incorporated into phosphatidylcholine (pc), lysophosphatidylcholine (lpc),
and sphingomyelin (sm). the analyses indicated that at
the end of 3 h labeling period, 94.2% of choline-containing phospholipids were represented by pc, 2.3%
by lpc, and 3.1% by sm (fig. 1). the eﬀect of badrenergic agonist,  xxxd2401xxx , on the cholinecontaining phospholipid release is presented in fig. 2a.

the phospholipid secretion showed a dose-dependent
increase with the  xxxd2401xxx  concentration up to
10 lm, at which point a 3.1-fold increase in phospholipids release was observed. introduction to the incubation medium of a speciﬁc b-adrenergic antagonist,
 xxxd123xxx , led to the impedance of the isoproterenolinduced increase in phospholipid release. the eﬀect of

 xxxd123xxx  was dose-dependent and the optimal concentration of 20 lm produced an 86% impedance of the
 xxxd2401xxx  stimulatory eﬀect (fig. 2b).
the prosecretory eﬀect of  xxxd2401xxx  on cholinecontaining phospholipid release by salivary gland
acinar cells was subjected to suppression by the pretreatment with a speciﬁc inhibitor of egfr kinase,

pd153035, which at its optimal concentration of
100 nm reduced the  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated phospholipid release by 72.5% (fig. 3a). moreover, the secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx  were also inhibited by
 xxxd1307xxx , a selective inhibitor of  xxxg2198xxx  src responsible for ligand-independent egfr transactivation, whereas pp3 a pharmacologically inactive analog
of  xxxd1307xxx  produced no eﬀect (fig. 3b). the eﬀect of  xxxd1307xxx 
was concentration-dependent and  xxxd1891xxx  lm produced a
69.1% reduction of the  xxxd2401xxx -stimulated
phospholipid release.
as prosecretory actions of  xxxd2401xxx  are exerted
through camp-dependent activation of pka, and the

downstream eﬀects of egfr are mediated by  xxxg1751xxx , we
next examined the acinar cell phospholipid secretory
responses in the presence of  xxxg1751xxx  inhibitor,  xxxd3536xxx . the results revealed that pretreatment with  xxxd3536xxx  at 100 nm led to a 78.4% reduction in the acinar
cell phospholipid secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx ,
the phospholipid secretory responses to a cell permeable
analog of camp, dibutyryl-camp, decreased by a
72.8%, while the prosecretory eﬀects of  xxxg67xxx 
activator,  xxxd1742xxx , were reduced by 81.3% (fig. 4). in
contrast, pretreatment of the acinar cells with the inhibitor of erk pathway,  xxxd1169xxx , caused only marginal if any subsequent alterations in phospholipid

discussion
the principal regulatory factors controlling the extent
and nature of salivary secretions are autonomic neurotransmitters released by innervating sympathetic and
parasympathetic nerves, and the acinar cells of salivary
glands possess receptors capable of responding to signal
from either system [5,6]. while the secretion of salivary
ﬂuid is promoted by activation of cholinergic and
a-adrenergic receptors coupled to gpcrs that regulate
the generation of ca2þ and pkc second messengers, the
b-adrenergic agonists couple to gpcrs that regulate the
generation of camp and pka activation, and stimulate
the secretion of macromolecular constituents of saliva
[6,7]. moreover, recent studies with several diﬀerent cell
systems into the nature of cellular responses mediated by
gpcr signaling systems provided well-documented
evidence that camp-dependent agonists have the capability to induce egfr transactivation [8–12]. indeed,
activation of gpcr by b-adrenergic receptor agonist,
 xxxd2401xxx , has been reported to lead to egfr
transactivation with the involvement of pka-induced
stimulation of erk and src kinases in transformed
kidney cells [8], and colonic epithelial cells respond to
stimulation by vip with gpcr-mediated signaling
pathway through camp- and pka-dependent egfr
transactivation that involves  xxxg1751xxx  [10]. thus, communication between receptor  xxxg2198xxx  activation and
gpcr-mediated signaling is emerging as a common
integrator linking diverse aspects of intracellular
signaling pathways.
hence, in the study presented herein, using secretory
cells of sublingual salivary gland, we examined the involvement of egfr transactivation in regulation of salivary phospholipid secretion in response to stimulation
with b-adrenergic agonist,  xxxd2401xxx . the results revealed that exposure of the acinar cells to  xxxd2401xxx 
led to a dose-dependent stimulation in phospholipid release, and that this eﬀect of  xxxd2401xxx  was sensitive to
inhibition by b-adrenergic antagonist,  xxxd123xxx . moreover, the prosecretory eﬀect of  xxxd2401xxx  on
phospholipid release was subjected to suppression by a
speciﬁc inhibitor of egfr kinase activity, pd153035, as
well as  xxxd3536xxx , a speciﬁc inhibitor of  xxxg1751xxx .  xxxd3536xxx , furthermore, caused the reduction in the acinar
cell phospholipid secretory responses to b-adrenergic
agonist generated second messenger, camp as well as
 xxxg67xxx  activator,  xxxd1742xxx . together, these data
provide evidence for the role of egfr in mediation of badrenergic agonist prosecretory action on salivary
phospholipid release, and point to  xxxg1751xxx  as a critical
regulator of camp-dependent secretory responses.

251

our ﬁndings are supported by the results obtained
recently with intestinal epithelial cells where stimulation
with vip or dibutyryl-camp led to a rapid recruitment
of a  xxxg1749xxx   xxxg1750xxx  regulatory subunit of  xxxg1751xxx  to the egfr [10].
this process is associated with autophosphorylation of
tyrosine residue within the regulatory subunit and leads
to an increase in catalytic activity of p110 subunit of
 xxxg1751xxx  towards membrane inositol lipids that trigger
protein kinaseb/akt activation [14,15]. interestingly,
akt activation and  xxxg1751xxx -dependent generation of
phosphatidylinositol phosphates have been shown to be
sensitive to an inhibitor of src kinase [14], and the inhibition of  xxxg1751xxx  with  xxxd3536xxx  attenuated secretory
responses not only to vip and dibutyryl-camp, but also
to the  xxxg67xxx  activator,  xxxd1742xxx  [10].
as the events of egfr transactivation are also
associated with the activation of erk mapk and the
non-receptor  xxxg2198xxx  src [9,12,16,17], we focused further in our studies on the role these kinases
play in mediation of the acinar cell phospholipid secretory responses to b-adrenergic agonist stimulation.
the results revealed that while the inhibition of src
kinase with a selective pharmacological inhibitor,  xxxd1307xxx ,
evoked a signiﬁcant reduction in the acinar cell
phospholipid secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx , the
erk inhibitor,  xxxd1169xxx , caused only marginal if any
alterations in subsequent phospholipid secretory responses to the agonist. the inhibition of erk, furthermore, did not attenuate the acinar cell secretory
responses to dibutyryl-camp and the  xxxg67xxx 
activator,  xxxd1742xxx . these ﬁndings are consistent with
the data gathered with intestinal epithelial cells and
demonstrating that, although cmap-dependent agonist-induced egfr transactivation is accompanied by
erk phosphorylation, erk mapk does not appear
to be involved in regulation of camp-induced secretory responses [10]. moreover, our ﬁnding that the
acinar cell phospholipid secretory responses to  xxxd2401xxx  stimulation were blocked by  xxxd1307xxx , and the
reports indicating that b-adrenergic receptor-mediated
src activation precedes egfr transactivation [8,12,17]
attest to a critical requirement for src in the regulation
gpcr-mediated secretory events that require egfr
phosphorylation.
