abstract
obesity and non-insulin-dependent diabetes favor storage of  xxxd2154xxx  in triacylglycerol over oxidation. recently, individual
acyl-coa synthetase (acs) isoforms have been implicated in the channeling of  xxxd2154xxx  either toward lipid synthesis or
toward oxidation. although  xxxg47xxx  had been localized to three diﬀerent subcellular regions in rat liver, endoplasmic reticulum,
mitochondria, and peroxisomes, the study had used an antibody raised against the full-length  xxxg47xxx  protein which cross-reacts
with other isoforms, probably because all acs family members contain highly conserved amino acid sequences. therefore, we
examined the subcellular location of  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 in rat liver to determine which isoform was present in peroxisomes, whether the acss were intrinsic membrane proteins, and which acs isoforms were up-regulated by  xxxg1805xxx  ligands.
non-cross-reacting  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg49xxx , and acs5 peptide antibodies showed that  xxxg49xxx  was the only acs isoform present in
peroxisomes isolated from livers of gemﬁbrozil-treated rats.  xxxg49xxx  was also present in fractions identiﬁed as mitochondriaassociated membrane (mam).  xxxg47xxx  was present in endoplasmic reticulum fractions and acs5 was present in mitochondrial
fractions. incubation with troglitazone, a speciﬁc inhibitor of  xxxg49xxx , decreased acs activity in the mam fractions 30–45% and
in the peroxisomal fractions about 30%. because the signal for  xxxg49xxx  protein in peroxisomes was so strong compared to the
mam fraction, we examined  xxxg49xxx  mrna abundance in livers of rats treated with the  xxxg1805xxx  agonist gw9578. treatment
with gw9578 increased  xxxg49xxx  mrna abundance 40% and  xxxg47xxx  mrna 25%. although we had originally proposed that
 xxxg49xxx  is linked to triacylglycerol synthesis, it now appears that  xxxg49xxx  may also be important in activating  xxxd2154xxx  destined
for peroxisomal oxidation. we also determined that, unlike  xxxg47xxx  and 5,  xxxg49xxx  is not an intrinsic membrane protein. this
suggests that  xxxg49xxx  is probably targeted and linked to mam and peroxisomes by interactions with other proteins. ó 2002

acs catalyzes the activation of  xxxd2154xxx 
to fatty acyl-coa thioesters by one of a family of longchain acyl-coa synthetases [5]. in rat, ﬁve acs isoforms, each the product of a diﬀerent gene, have been
cloned. the tissue distribution of each acs diﬀers and,
although each will use a broad range of fatty acid substrates encompassing both saturated and unsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  of 14–22 carbons,  xxxg48xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  are distinguished by a marked preference for 20:4 and 20:5.
 xxxg47xxx , acs2, and acs5 have 60% homology to each
other, whereas members of a second subfamily,  xxxg48xxx 
and  xxxg49xxx , have about 30% homology with  xxxg47xxx  and
about 60% with each other.
studies using the inhibitors troglitazone and triacsin
c and d with cultured cells strongly suggest that individual acss provide acyl-coas for speciﬁc pathways of
fatty acid metabolism [6,7]. in hepatocytes, these compounds markedly inhibit the incorporation of labeled
fatty acid into triacylglycerol and phospholipid via the
de novo synthetic pathway from glycerol 3-phosphate,
but have no eﬀect on phospholipid reacylation and little
eﬀect on fatty acid oxidation [2]. speciﬁcity of the inhibitors for particular pathways and the hypothesis that
diﬀerent acss might synthesize acyl-coas destined for
diﬀerent metabolic pathways was strengthened by our
studies of the three acs isoforms expressed in liver.
using puriﬁed recombinant rat acss we demonstrated
that triacsin c inhibits  xxxg47xxx  and  xxxg49xxx  but not acs5
and that the thiazolidinediones inhibit only  xxxg49xxx  [3].
further, we found that each of these acs isoforms has a
unique subcellular location, again suggesting linkage to
speciﬁc metabolic pathways [4].
because it had been reported that  xxxg47xxx  was present in
three locations, er, mitochondria, and peroxisomes [8],
but we were unable to identify immunoreactive  xxxg47xxx  in
mitochondria [2,4], we used non-cross-reacting peptide
antibodies to examine puriﬁed peroxisomal fractions for
acs expression. we found that  xxxg49xxx  protein is highly
expressed in peroxisomes and investigated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a ( xxxg1805xxx ) regulation of  xxxg49xxx . furthermore, although  xxxg49xxx  is found in
subcellular membrane fractions, transmembrane prediction algorithms for  xxxg49xxx  fail to identify membranespanning regions. therefore, we revisited the dogma that
all acss are intrinsic membrane proteins.

experimental procedures
materials
[14 c]palmitate was from amersham life sciences
coa, atp, and bsa (essentially fatty acid free) were
from sigma. troglitazone was the gift of dr. steven
jacobs, glaxosmithkline. antibodies against  xxxg47xxx , 4,
5, and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase ( xxxg1808xxx )

have been described previously [4]. antibody against
phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase ( xxxg1482xxx )
was the gift of jean e. vance, university of alberta.
animals and tissue isolation
animal protocols were approved by the university of
north carolina at chapel hill, san diego state university, and glaxosmithkline institutional animal care
and use committees. female (150 g) sprague–dawley
rats were housed on a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle with free
access to water. liver microsomes and mitochondria
were isolated by diﬀerential centrifugation [9] with the
following modiﬁcations for isolating salt-washed microsomes and mitochondria. after the initial isolation of
mitochondria and microsomes, the mitochondrial or
microsomal pellets were resuspended in half the original
volume of homogenization buﬀer and divided into two
equal aliquots. an equal volume of homogenization
buﬀer or homogenization buﬀer plus 1.0 m kcl was
added to each aliquot prior to homogenization and
centrifugation.
to separate peroxisomal fractions from er and mitochondria, a postnuclear fraction prepared by diﬀerential centrifugation of liver from rats maintained on
chow plus 0.2% gemﬁbrozil for 17 days was further
puriﬁed by equilibrium density centrifugation on a linear (20–40%) optiprep gradient. salt-washed peroxisomes were obtained by pooling fractions 15–20 and
diluting in homogenization buﬀer or homogenization
buﬀer plus kcl (ﬁnal conc. 0.5 m). following homogenization, peroxisomal membrane pellets were obtained
by centrifugation at 100,000g.
protein concentrations were determined by the bca
method (pierce) using bsa as the standard.
northern analyses
for  xxxg1805xxx  activation experiments, frozen livers
from rats that had been fed a diet supplemented with
either the vehicle 5%  xxxd2609xxx  ðn ¼ 4þ or 0.3 mg/
kg gw9578, a  xxxg1805xxx  agonist ðn ¼ 4þ, for 7 days before
sacriﬁce were obtained from deborah winegar, glaxosmithkline. total rna was isolated using trizol reagent (life technologies) and a modiﬁcation of the
method of chomczynski and sacchi [10]. total rna
(20 lg) was denatured in a solution containing 15 mm
formamide, 2.7 m mops, and 0.06% ethidium bromide,
separated on a 1.1% agarose–formaldehyde gel, and
transferred to a nylon membrane. probes against  xxxg47xxx ,
4, 5, acyl-coa oxidase (aco) and glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) were labeled with
[32 p]ctp by random priming (boehringer mannheim).
the blot was exposed to a phosphor screen and the
signal was quantiﬁed with a molecular dynamics storm
840 system. after probing for acs or aco, blots were

stripped and reprobed for  xxxg861xxx . the acs or aco
signal intensity was normalized to the intensity of the
corresponding  xxxg861xxx  bands.
immunoblotting
proteins were separated on an 8% polyacrylamide gel
containing 1% sds, transferred to a pvdf membrane
(bio-rad), and incubated with antibody against  xxxg47xxx ,
 xxxg49xxx , acs5,  xxxg1808xxx , or  xxxg1482xxx . for chemiluminescent
detection, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by
incubating the membrane with hrp-conjugated goat
anti-rabbit igg and picowest reagents (pierce).
enzyme assays
acyl-coa synthetase was assayed at 37 °c for 5 min
with 5 mm atp, 250 lm coa, and 20 lm [14 c]palmitate [11]. activities measured initial rates. optiprep
fractions were assayed for esterase, glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and catalase [12] to identify fractions
containing er, mitochondria, and peroxisomes, respectively. adenylate kinase [13] and nadph  xxxg569xxx  reductase [14] were measured as described.

fig. 1.  xxxg49xxx  is located in peroxisomes. a postnuclear
fraction prepared by diﬀerential centrifugation from liver of a rat
maintained on a supplement of 0.2% gemﬁbrozil for 17 days was
further puriﬁed by equilibrium density centrifugation on a linear (20–
40%) optiprep gradient, and fractions were collected (3 (top)–20
(bottom)). protein (100 lg for all fractions except for fractions 15–20
with antibody against  xxxg49xxx , which used only 10 lg protein) from each
fraction was analyzed by western blot with antibodies against  xxxg49xxx ,
acs5,  xxxg47xxx ,  xxxg1808xxx , and  xxxg1482xxx . the approximate molecular mass of
each immunoblotted protein is indicated on the right side. location of

results
 xxxg49xxx  is located in peroxisomes
we have previously shown that in rat liver,  xxxg47xxx  is
located in er, mitochondrial-associated membrane
(mam), and cytosol,  xxxg49xxx  is located in mam, and
acs5 is located in mitochondria [4]. mam is an er
fraction deﬁned by its close association with mitochondria, the presence of  xxxg1482xxx -2, and high speciﬁc activities of acyl-coa:cholesterol acyltransferase (acat),
diacylglycerol acyltransferase (dgat) [15], and phosphatidylserine synthase-1 and -2 [35]. depending on the
cell fractionation method employed, mam, identiﬁed
by the presence of  xxxg1482xxx -2, is found in crude mitochondrial or microsomal preparations [4]. because
 xxxg47xxx  had been identiﬁed in peroxisomes [8], a site for
acyl-coa metabolism through b-oxidation, we looked
for the presence of the acs isoforms by analyzing rat
liver homogenate fractionated over an optiprep gradient by western blot with non-cross-reacting peptidespeciﬁc antibodies against  xxxg47xxx , 4, and 5.
we found that  xxxg49xxx  (74 kda) was highly expressed
in fractions 15–20 (fig. 1). the signal on the western
blot was so strong that only 1/10 the amount of total
protein loaded for other western blot analyses (10 lg vs
100 lg) was required. fractions 15–20 contain the
highest catalase activity, indicating that they are highly
enriched in peroxisomes (fig. 2c). these fractions
contain no esterase or gdh activity, indicating lack of

contamination with er or mitochondria (figs. 2a and
b). we also conﬁrmed our previous ﬁnding that  xxxg49xxx 
(74 kda) is located in mam, fractions 5–10 and 15–18
which contain  xxxg1482xxx , a speciﬁc marker for mam (fig.
1) [15]. fractions 6–10 also contain a small peak of
catalase (fig. 2c), representing soluble catalase that was
released from broken peroxisomes. the  xxxg49xxx  protein in
fractions 8–9, however, was present only in the pellet
after recentrifugation at 100,000g for 1 h (data not
shown), indicating that that they remained with nonperoxisomal organelles. interestingly, we also detected a
larger 80 kda species of  xxxg49xxx  in fractions 7–9 which
may correspond to a 4500-da larger isoform that uses
an alternative start site 117 nucleotides upstream [16].
in contrast to the presence of  xxxg49xxx  protein, total
acs activity (fig. 2d) was present in three approximately equal peaks corresponding to the esterase marker
(fig. 2a) for endoplasmic reticulum, the gdh marker
(fig. 2b) for mitochondria, and the catalase marker
(fig. 2c) for peroxisomes. the acs activity measured is
the sum of the three long-chain acss known to be expressed in liver and possibly other, as yet undiscovered,
acs isoforms.
we assayed the optiprep fractions for acs activity in
the absence and presence of troglitazone, a speciﬁc inhibitor of acs 4 [3], to conﬁrm the presence of  xxxg49xxx  in
fractions 6–10 and 15–20. troglitazone (50 lm) speciﬁcally inhibited acs activity in fractions that expressed
 xxxg49xxx  (fig. 3). troglitazone inhibited acs activity 30–

fig. 2. separation of liver organelles by equilibrium density centrifugation: acs activity is located in er, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. a
postnuclear fraction prepared by diﬀerential centrifugation from liver of a rat maintained on a diet of 0.2% gemﬁbrozil for 17 days was further
puriﬁed by equilibrium density centrifugation on a linear (20–40%) optiprep gradient to separate peroxisomes from er and mitochondria. enzyme
activities are plotted as relative concentration vs fraction number. relative concentration (c/ci) is calculated by dividing the enzyme concentration in

45% in the mam-containing fractions 8–10, consistent
with our previous ﬁndings [4]. in the peroxisomal fractions, 15–20, 50 lm troglitazone inhibited acs activity
about 30%.
 xxxg47xxx  was detected in fractions 8–10 (fig. 1) which
have high esterase activity (fig. 2a), indicating an enrichment in endoplasmic reticulum. this result agrees
with our previous ﬁnding of  xxxg47xxx  in microsomes [4].
we also detected  xxxg47xxx  in the very light fractions 3–7.
 xxxg47xxx  was not detected in peroxisomes, even though it
had been previously reported in this fraction using an
antibody raised against full-length  xxxg47xxx  [8].
acs5 at 76 kda was detected in fractions 11–14 (fig.
1) which are enriched in mitochondria, as evidenced by

high gdh activity (fig. 2b) and the presence of  xxxg1808xxx 
(fig. 1), an outer mitochondrial membrane protein.
acs5 was also detected in light fractions 3–7 which also
contain  xxxg1808xxx , consistent with the presence of broken
outer mitochondrial membranes. the presence of acs5
in fractions enriched in mitochondria and the absence of
acs5 from peroxisomal fractions was a clarifying result, since our previous liver mitochondrial preparation
may have been contaminated with peroxisomes [4]. the
acs5 antiserum also detected a 73-kda protein in
mam fractions 8–9 (fig. 1), as we previously reported
[4].
 xxxg49xxx  mrna is up-regulated by the
 xxxg1805xxx  agonist gw9578
because  xxxg49xxx  protein was highly abundant in liver
peroxisomes from rats maintained on a diet of 0.2%
gemﬁbrozil for 17 days, we examined the regulation of
 xxxg49xxx  expression by  xxxg1805xxx  [17,18]. we obtained livers
from rats given vehicle (5%  xxxd2609xxx ; n ¼ 4) or
0.3 mg/kg gw9578 [19] ( xxxg1805xxx  agonist; n ¼ 4) for 7
days, isolated total rna, and measured the abundance
of  xxxg47xxx , 4, and 5 mrna by northern blot analysis.
treatment with gw9578 increased  xxxg49xxx  mrna 42%
and  xxxg47xxx  mrna 25% (fig. 4), but acs5 mrna levels
were not altered. aco mrna levels, which have been
shown to increase after treatment with peroxisome
proliferators [20], were three-fold greater in gw9578treated rats.

fig. 3. acyl-coa synthetase activity is inhibited by troglitazone in
 xxxg49xxx -containing fractions. a postnuclear fraction prepared by differential centrifugation from liver of a rat maintained on a supplement
of 0.2% gemﬁbrozil for 17 days was further puriﬁed by equilibrium
density centrifugation on a linear (20–40%) optiprep gradient, and
fractions were collected (5 (top)–20 (bottom)). representative of duplicate experiments. (top) fractions (0:5 lg protein) were assayed for
acs activity in the absence or presence of 50 lm troglitazone. (bottom) protein (100 lg for fractions 5–14 or 10 lg for fractions 15–20)
was analyzed by western blot with antibodies against  xxxg49xxx .

 xxxg49xxx  is not an intrinsic membrane
protein
although  xxxg47xxx , 4, and 5 are all detected in membrane fractions and have 30–60% amino acid identity,
the transmembrane prediction algorithms tmpred [21],
das [22], sosui [23], and tmhmm [24] all predict
that  xxxg47xxx  and 5 each have at least one transmembrane

fig. 4.  xxxg49xxx  mrna is upregulated by the  xxxg1805xxx 
activator, gw9578. liver total rna from rats given vehicle (5%
 xxxd2609xxx ; n ¼ 4) or 0.3 mg/kg gw9578 ( xxxg1805xxx  agonist; n ¼ 4)
for 7 days was analyzed by northern blot with probes against  xxxg49xxx ,
 xxxg47xxx , acs5, aco, and  xxxg861xxx  as a loading control. (top) acs or
aco signal from control and gw9578-treated samples was normalized to the  xxxg861xxx  signal and presented as the ratio of acs/
 xxxg861xxx  + se or aco/ xxxg861xxx  + se (*p 6 0:015). (bottom) representative blots are shown for each acs isoform, aco, and the corresponding  xxxg861xxx  control.

domain but that  xxxg49xxx  contains no transmembrane
segments. comparison of kyte–doolitle hydropathy
plots [25] generated for  xxxg47xxx , 4, and 5 also clearly
shows that  xxxg49xxx  does not have any regions with the
hydrophobic character required for a transmembrane
segment. on the other hand,  xxxg47xxx  and acs5 each have
at least one predicted hydrophobic segment. if  xxxg49xxx 
does not contain a predicted transmembrane domain, it
is likely to be a membrane-associated protein linked to
mam and peroxisomal membranes via speciﬁc protein–
protein interactions.
to determine whether acs 4 is an intrinsic membrane protein or a membrane-associated protein, we
tested whether  xxxg49xxx  could be removed from peroxisomes and mam with a salt wash. liver peroxisomes
(optiprep fractions 15–20) and microsomes (which
contain the mam fraction) were incubated and homogenized in the absence or presence of high salt levels
and then recentrifuged. the presence of 0.5 m kcl removed a majority of the  xxxg49xxx  protein from the peroxisomal membrane and a stronger  xxxg49xxx  signal was
detected in the kcl supernatant fraction (fig. 5a). high
salt levels completely washed  xxxg49xxx  from the microsomal membranes and  xxxg49xxx  immunoreactive protein
appeared in the kcl wash fraction (fig. 5b). these data
indicate that  xxxg49xxx  is not an intrinsic membrane protein,
consistent with the results from transmembrane prediction algorithms.

267

fig. 5.  xxxg49xxx  is not an intrinsic membrane protein.
rat liver peroxisomes (a), microsomes (b), and mitochondria (c) were
washed with homogenization buﬀer or with homogenization buﬀer
containing 0.5 m kcl. peroxisomal (a), microsomal (b), and mitochondrial (c) pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to
western blot analysis with the indicated antibodies (left). the approximate molecular mass of each immunoblotted protein is indicated
on the right.

also consistent with these transmembrane predictive
programs, we found that  xxxg47xxx  and the 73-kda acs5
remain bound to microsomes following kcl treatment
(fig. 5b). in mitochondria, acs5 (76-kda) was also not
removed by the kcl treatment (fig. 5c), and a smaller
73-kda acs5 band was present only in the wash fractions. the inability of 0.5 m kcl to remove  xxxg47xxx  and 5
from membranes suggests that these are intrinsic membrane proteins.
although the separate activities of the individual
acs isoforms cannot be distinguished, we measured the
total acs activity in microsomes, kcl-washed microsomes, mitochondria, kcl-washed mitochondria, and
supernatant fractions. after treatment with 0.5 m kcl,
the total acs activity recovered in the pellet fraction
decreased 60% (fig. 6a). the decrease in acs activity
was not due to inactivation of acs by kcl, since incubation of untreated microsomes for 1.5 h with 0.5 m
kcl had no eﬀect on total acs activity (data not
shown). further, the kcl treatment did not aﬀect recovery of the microsomes themselves, because there was
no diﬀerence in nadph  xxxg569xxx  reductase activity between control and salt-washed microsomal pellet fractions (table 1).

268

t.m. lewin et al. / archives of biochemistry and biophysics 404 (2002) 263–270

because the loss of acs activity from the microsomal
pellet fraction is consistent with our ﬁnding that  xxxg49xxx  is
removed from microsomal membranes following kcl
treatment, we expected to recover the acs activity in
the kcl supernatant fraction that contained immunoreactive  xxxg49xxx . however, although acs activity increased in the supernatant fraction after kcl treatment
(fig. 6b), the total activity recovered was only 0.6 mmol/
min/total protein, whereas 1.6 mmol/min/total protein
was lost from the microsomal fraction. further, the
small increase in acs activity in the kcl supernatant
fraction was not due to the presence of additional microsomes, because nadph  xxxg569xxx  reductase
activity did not increase in the kcl supernatant fraction
(table 1). we were also unable to measure an increase in
acs activity in the peroxisomal supernatant fraction
collected after high salt wash (data not shown).
in mitochondrial pellets collected after treatment
with 0.5 m kcl, total acs activity increased 17% (fig.
6a), consistent with assaying a more highly puriﬁed
membrane fraction from which peripheral protein had
been removed. incubating untreated mitochondria with
0.5 m kcl for 1.5 h had no eﬀect on acs activity (data
not shown). as expected, acs activity was unchanged
in the mitochondrial supernatant fractions (fig. 6b).
that the 0.5 m kcl wash did not disrupt mitochondria
is shown by the absence of diﬀerences in adenylate kinase activity in untreated and treated mitochondria and
in the control and kcl supernatant fractions (table 1).
fig. 6. microsomal acyl-coa synthetase activity is lost after a 0.5 m
kcl wash. rat liver microsomes and mitochondria were washed with
homogenization buﬀer ()kcl) or with homogenization buﬀer containing 0.5 m kcl (+kcl). (a) microsomal and mitochondrial pellet
fractions and (b) microsomal and mitochondrial supernatant fractions
were assayed for acs activity.

discussion
the presence of individual acs isoforms in speciﬁc
subcellular fractions suggests that they play separate
and deﬁned roles in providing long-chain acyl-coas for
particular metabolic pathways. understanding the subcellular locations of the speciﬁc acs isoforms would
help in clarifying their roles. previous data localizing

 xxxg47xxx  to three diﬀerent subcellular regions in rat liver,
endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and peroxisomes,
was the result of a carefully performed study that used
an antibody raised against the full-length  xxxg47xxx  protein
[8]. we now know that an antibody raised to a complete
 xxxg47xxx  protein will also detect both  xxxg49xxx  and acs5,
most likely because all acs family members contain
highly conserved amino acid sequences that probably
retain similar epitopes [4]. use of an antibody raised to
an  xxxg47xxx  peptide that has little homology to  xxxg49xxx  or
acs5 showed that  xxxg47xxx  is not, in fact, located in mitochondria [4]. thus, we decided to investigate puriﬁed
peroxisomal fractions to determine which acs isoform
was present. not only was  xxxg49xxx  the only isoform present in peroxisomes, it appeared to be present in
amounts greater than previously observed in the mam
fraction [4]. in rats fed gw9578, a  xxxg1805xxx  activator,
 xxxg49xxx  mrna expression increased 42%,  xxxg47xxx  increased 25%, and acs5 was unchanged. as had been
previously observed,  xxxg49xxx  was also present in the
mam fractions identiﬁed by the presence of immunoreactive  xxxg1482xxx ,  xxxg47xxx  was present in er fractions
identiﬁed by the presence of esterase, and acs5 was
found in mitochondrial fractions that also contained
gdh and immunoreactive  xxxg1808xxx  [4].
acs activity was ﬁrst demonstrated in peroxisomes
in 1966 [26]. peroxisomes were reported to contain 7%
of the total  xxxd2832xxx –coa synthetase activity in liver,
and total liver acs activity increases two- to three-fold
after rats are treated with the  xxxg1805xxx  activator cloﬁbrate [27]. part of this increase in acs activity is likely
due to up-regulation of  xxxg47xxx  [28] and  xxxg49xxx  mrna
expression. in the gemﬁbrozil-treated rats,  xxxg49xxx  protein is much more highly expressed in peroxisomes than
in the mam fractions (fig. 1), yet the activities are
comparable (fig. 3), suggesting that much of the peroxisomal  xxxg49xxx  may be inactive under the isolation and
assay conditions used in this study.
peroxisomal acs activity is located on the cytosolic
face of the peroxisomal membrane [29]. of note is the
fact that several very long-chain acs isoforms are also
present on the peroxisomal membrane and these may
overlap in fatty acid speciﬁcity with the long-chain
acss [30,31]. our data show that troglitazone, a speciﬁc
inhibitor of  xxxg49xxx  [3], inhibits about 30% of the acs
activity in liver peroxisomal fractions from gemﬁbroziltreated rats; the resistant activity may represent an as yet
uncharacterized acs or the combined activities of the
several vlacs present. whether tzds inhibit any
vlacs isoforms is not known.
finding  xxxg49xxx  in peroxisomes is puzzling because
previous data strongly suggested that  xxxg49xxx  is linked to
triacylglycerol synthesis [4].  xxxg49xxx  is speciﬁcally inhibited by triacsin c, an alkenyl-n-hydroxytriazene fungal
metabolite that is a fatty acid analog and competitive
inhibitor [32,33], and by the thiazolidinedione drugs,

269

troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, which exhibit a complex inhibition that has noncompetitive,
uncompetitive, and mixed aspects depending on which
of the three acs substrates is tested [3]. because in rat
primary hepatocytes, triacsin c and troglitazone
strongly inhibit incorporation of fatty acid into triacylglycerol but have weaker eﬀects on incorporation into
phospholipid [34], we hypothesized that  xxxg49xxx  might be
linked to triacylglycerol synthesis, perhaps by synthesizing a pool of acyl-coas that is channeled toward this
pathway. this hypothesis was strengthened by ﬁnding
 xxxg49xxx  in the mam fraction which contains microsomal
triglyceride transfer protein, apob,  xxxg1482xxx -2, high speciﬁc activities of acat and dgat [15], and phosphatidylserine synthase-1 and -2 [35]. vance’s group has
hypothesized that the function of mam may involve
vldl assembly [15] or the import of lipids into mitochondria [36].
finding  xxxg49xxx  in peroxisomes of gemﬁbrozil-treated
rats led us to hypothesize that  xxxg49xxx  might be up-regulated by peroxisome proliferators as has been reported
for  xxxg47xxx  [28,37]. gw9578 is cited as the most potent
 xxxg1805xxx  agonist known to date [19]. treatment of rats
for 7 days with gw9578 resulted in a 42% increase in
 xxxg49xxx  mrna (fig. 4). message for  xxxg47xxx , which has a
ppre, was increased to a similar degree (25%), although previous studies reported that 0.5% fenoﬁbrate
treatment for 14 days increased  xxxg47xxx  mrna 5- to 40fold [37] and that 14-day treatment with 0.1% wy14,643 did not alter  xxxg47xxx  mrna expression [38]. since
we expected a more robust response in  xxxg47xxx  message,
we performed a control experiment for the eﬃcacy of
gw9578. we measured changes in the expression of
aco, a peroxisomal b-oxidation enzyme, following
gw9578 treatment. consistent with previous studies
using peroxisome proliferators [20], gw9578 resulted in
a 3-fold increase in aco expression (fig. 4). although
no ppre has been reported in the  xxxg49xxx  promoter [39],
our data suggest that  xxxg49xxx  is modestly up-regulated by
the  xxxg1805xxx  agonist gw9578, to a degree similar to that
of  xxxg47xxx . other  xxxg1805xxx  agonists may be more potent
up-regulators of  xxxg49xxx , as observed for  xxxg47xxx . our new
ﬁndings that  xxxg49xxx  protein is highly expressed in peroxisomes and may be up-regulated by a  xxxg1805xxx  ligand
suggest that  xxxg49xxx  may also play a role in the activation
of polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  destined to be oxidized in
peroxisomes. this is consistent with the 2-fold preference that  xxxg49xxx  exhibits toward  xxxd208xxx  as
compared to palmitate [40]. in this light, it is of interest
that  xxxg49xxx  +/) female mice have decreased fertility and
marked accumulation of uterine prostaglandins [41],
suggesting that a defect in  xxxg49xxx  allows  xxxd208xxx 
to increase in uterine cells, thereby promoting the synthesis of prostaglandins.
another ﬁnding was that, unlike  xxxg47xxx  and acs5,
 xxxg49xxx  is not an intrinsic membrane protein. conﬁrming

the hydropathy plot and transmembrane prediction algorithms,  xxxg49xxx  was readily washed from liver peroxisomes and microsomes by 0.5 m kcl (figs. 5a and b),
indicating that  xxxg49xxx  is not an integral membrane protein. consistent with this result, high salt treatment
caused total acs activity in microsomes to decrease
60% (fig. 6a). although we detected an increase in the
 xxxg49xxx  immunoreactive band in microsomal and peroxisomal supernatant fractions after kcl treatment (figs.
5a and b), we did not measure an increase in acs activity (fig. 6a and data not shown). this suggests that
the salt treatment may have removed a microsomal
component required for activity. taken as a whole, the
data indicate that  xxxg49xxx  is a peripheral membrane
protein and suggest that it is probably targeted and
linked by interactions with other proteins to its two very
speciﬁc membrane locations.
 xxxg49xxx  may provide two seemingly diﬀerent and even
contradictory functions within liver. under conditions
of energy surplus, it may provide acyl-coas destined
for triacylglycerol synthesis and export in vldl from
mam, whereas under conditions of fasting,  xxxg49xxx  in
peroxisomes may activate excess  xxxd208xxx  that
is destined for peroxisomal oxidation. studies to test
these predictions will require the use of speciﬁc inhibitors for  xxxg49xxx  and for mitochondrial vs peroxisomal
oxidation.
