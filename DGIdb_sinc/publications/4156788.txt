a number of regulatory processes exist which influence the biosynthesis of catecholamines
in adrenergic neurons .lsa the large number of events, occurring in a highly synchronized
fashion, implies a wide variety of possible regulatory sites. it is likely that the specializations required for the regulated synthesis, storage and release of norepinephrine (ne)
are so integrated that any modification which occurs in one of these processes will interact
with, and affect other regulatory processes. the schematic diagram (fig. 1) depicts an
adrenergic varicosity and illustrates some of the sites at which catecholamine biosynthesis
may be regulated.
the initial precursor of ne biosynthesis can be either tyrosine or phenylalanine. since
these amino acids are charged at physiological  xxxg1660xxx ’s an uptake mechanism is probably
required to ,facilitate their entrance into the nerve ending. when phenylalanine is the
precursor it is converted into tyrosine, apparently by  xxxg2276xxx .3 it is usually
plasma tyrosine, however, which is the predominant precursor of the catecholamines.4
the enzyme  xxxg2276xxx  (th) catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to dopa.
this reaction requires at least two co-factors : oxygen and tetrahydrobiopterin. it may also
require iron which is needed in vitro for maximal activity.4 the natural co-factor appears to
be tetrahydrobiopterin
(thb) which is synthesized from dihydrobiopterin (dhb) by the
enzyme  xxxg1912xxx  (pr).5 this co-factor appears to be present in excess
in most tissues but it is certainly possible that under some conditions either the co-factor
itself, or its biosynthetic enzyme, could become limiting and could, therefore, affect or
modulate catecholamine biosynthesis .6 the conversion of dopa into dopamine by laromatic amino acid decarboxylase (l-aad) is not generally thought to be a limiting
reaction or a regulated step in catecholamine biosynthesis. it is interesting, however, that
the enzyme(s) responsible for the decarboxylation of the various biogenic amines have
been reported to have separate and distinct subcellular localizations.7 the decarboxylation
of dopa takes place in the cytoplasm and the dopamine thus formed must be transported
into adrenergic storage granules before it can be /3-hydroxylated by dopamine-&hydroxylase
(d@3). it appears likely that this enzyme is nearly entirely contained within and bound
to the inside of the vesicle membrane. thus, for example, following the administration
of reserpine there is a marked decrease in the conversion of dopamine to ne.8 indicated

fig. 1. schematic diagram of an adrenergic varicosity.
on the diagram are two forms of dopamine-&hydroxylase,
a membrane-bound form
(dbh,) that is thought to make up from 80-95 per cent of the enzyme in nerve terminals,
and a soluble form (d/3hj which is contained within the adrenergic storage granules.gjo
in the adrenal chromaflln granule, on the other hand, only about 50 per cent of the enzyme
is bound to the membranes of the granule.ll
von euler and hillarj? were the first to observe that some of the ne present in
homogenates of sympathetic nerves is contained within particles. since that time, these
particles have been extensively investigated utilizing centrifugation methods (for reviews
see refs. (13, 14)). two types of ne-containing particles, distinguishable by a difference in
density, exist in nerve terminals. in homogenates of spleen approximately 20 per cent of the
vesicles are of the dense variety,15*16while in the vas deferens only about 4 per cent of the
vesicles are of this type.l5*17
it has been possible to correlate the data obtained by centrifugation with morphological
observations of noradrenergic nerves. three distinct types of membrane limited vesicles
have been distinguished in nerve terminals .18 there are large dense-cored vesicles approximately 800 a dia; small dense-cored vesicles, approximately 450 a dia; and small electronlucent vesicles about 450 a dia. both the large and the small dense-cored vesicles normally
contain catecho1amines.l’ furthermore, it appears likely that the electron-lucent vesicles
can take up and store exogenous amines .lg on the other hand, studies of noradrenergic
storage vesicles in the bovine splenic nerve reveal only a single type, the so-called large
dense-cored vesicle, which appears to correspond to the “heavy” noradrenergic vesicle
as measured by biochemical techniques in density gradients.16z20
in addition to dbh and norepinephrine a number of other constituents are normally
present in adrenergic storage granules. these include a number of soluble proteins, called

the regulationof the noradrenergicneuron

341

chromogranins (see ref. 14) as well as large amounts of adenine nucleotides. all of these
constituents appear to be released on nerve stimulation. there is excellent evidence that
catecholamines are released from the adrenal medulla by a process called exocytosis and
it appears likely that the same process occurs in sympathetic nerve terminals.
the relationship between the large and small vesicles, and between the membrane bound
and membrane enclosed (soluble) forms of dbh has not been satisfactorily elucidated.
one reasonable hypothesis (see ref. (21)) suggests that large granular vesicles are synthesized
in cell bodies and are then transported down the axon, along with their soluble chromogranins and dbh. in the nerve endings, the vesicles which have become enriched in ne
release their soluble contents by exocytosis. a second population of noradrenergic vesicles
are then formed from the membranes of the now empty large granular vesicles. the existence
of different types of adrenergic storage vesicles may imply a potentially important mechanism by which ne release is regulated.
in addition to the potential regulatory site represented by the different populations of storage granules a number of factors which appear to modulate the release of catecholamines
have been described. thus, ne which is released into the synaptic cleft can act on presynaptic cr-receptors to inhibit the release of additional ne. 22a further possible mechanism
for regulating the release of ne from adrenergic nerves involves prostaglandins of the e
type. these compounds are present in most mammalian tissues and an increased formation
and release of prostaglandins has been observed in conjunction with increased nerve
activity.23 in a number of experimental preparations the release of ne in response to nerve
stimulation is depressed by small doses of prostaglandins. thus, presynaptic cr-receptors
and prostaglandins seem to form part of a negative feedback control mechanism to modulate
the release of ne.
endogenous inhibitors of dbh are found in high concentrations in many organs.
they have been found in washed adrenal chromaffin granules,2q and we have recently
found a small percentage of the endogenous inhibitor in rat heart in the same regions of
density gradients as are noradrenergic storage granules.25 if these inhibitors are in fact
located in the storage vesicles they may be playing a very significant role in regulating dbh
activity and thus ne synthesis. there are enormous amounts of these inhibitors present
in many organs. a 1:5000 homogenate of rat spleen can inhibit pure dbh by about 50
per cent. this means that only a very small percentage of the inhibitors present in an organ
need have access to the enzyme for them to be playing a very significant physiological
role.
several of the enzymes involved in ne biosynthesis are relatively non-specific. tyramine,
for example, can be taken up into storage granules and can be /lhydroxylated to form
octopamine.26 using an enzymatic assay based on the specificity of the enzyme  xxxg1791xxx  ( xxxg1791xxx ) for /lhydroxylated amines we have shown that
octopamine is a normal constituent of adrenergic nerves. 27since octopamine can be released
on stimulation of the splenic nerve we proposed that it be considered a cotransmitter,
as opposed to a false transmitter. 28 the question of whether or not amines such as octopamine are playing a significant physiological role has not been answered as of the present
time. octopamine makes up only a small percentage of the biogenic amines in any
mammalian organ. on the other hand, octopamine turns over so rapidly ( xxxg147xxx -times

342

p. b. ~~olinoff

faster than ne) that the adrenergic neuron is exerting about 50 per cent as much effort in
synthesizing octopamine as in synthesizing ne. in some non-mammalian organs the
concentration of octopamine is very much higher than in mammalian organs,2s’30 and
it is becoming increasingly likely that it may have a significant physiological role in synaptic
transmission. in the snail, for example, it is a very potent inhibitor of certain spontaneously
firing nerve cells,31 and in cockroach thoracic ganglia, there is an adenylate cyclase that is
specifically sensitive to octopamine.32
ne is largely stored and protected from inactivation in the several types of adrenergic
storage granules. there does appear to be, however, a small pool of cytoplasmic ne.
either ne or dopamine, which is normally found in the cytoplasm, is able to inhibit the
activity of th.33s34this effect of the catecholamines seems to involve competition with the
pteridine co-factor .35 stimulation of sympathetic nerves results in an increase in the conversion of tyrosine to dopa via an activation of th. 36 it is not clear, however, whether
the increase in th activity is due to reduced end-product feedback inhibition or to other
factors.33
as is indicated in the figure, dopamine, as well as ne, is a substrate for monoamine
oxidase. approximately one-third of the catecholamine metabolites found in human urine
are derived from dopamine .37 some of these dopamine metabolites probably originate in
the corpus striatum. the observation that the excretion of dopamine and its metabolites
in the urine of at least some patients with parkinson’s disease is decreased only slightly
from normal levels38 suggests that some, if not most, of the dopamine which is found in
the urine has originated in the periphery. furthermore, the administration of reserpine
leads to a marked decrease in the synthesis of ne and to an increase in the release of
deaminated metabolites of dopamine. 8 this suggests that there is a competition between
oxidative deamination and uptake/,%hydroxylation. therefore, any change in the capacity
of the vesicles to take up and ,&hydroxylate dopamine should be reflected in changes in
ne synthesis.
a number of procedures which cause prolonged increases in the electrical activity of
adrenergic neurons lead to increases in the amounts of th, dbh and  xxxg1791xxx . these
procedures include the administration of pharmacological agents,11,39-a2 immobilization
stress,43s44psychosocial stresst5 and exposure to cold .46the administration of drugs which
deplete catecholamines leads to a fail in blood pressure and a presumed reflex increase in
activity in the sympathetic nervous system. following reserpine, for example, an increase in
th and dbh activities is observed in sympathetic ganglia, in the adrenal gland, and in
sympathetically innervated organs, such as the heart and salivary glands. in sympathetic
ganglia the increase in the two enzyme activities requires about 20 hr. in the heart the
increase in th activity occurs only after a 3-4 day lag,*’ while the increase in dbh activity is preceded by a significant decrease .42  xxxg1791xxx  activity in the adrenal gland also increases after reserpine or after chemical sympathectomy with 6-hydroxydopamine.40~41
the effect of agents such as reserpine on th and dbh activities in ganglia is transsynaptically mediated in that it is prevented by cutting the preganglionic nerves 41s48or
by the simultaneous administration of ganglionic blocking agents. the increases require
protein synthesis and are prevented by the administration of inhibitors of protein synthesis,
such as cycloheximide.42*48

neuron

343

the molecular mechanisms which relate the increase in nerve activity to the synthesis
of th and dbh are not yet understood. since adenosine 3’,5’-cyclic monophosphate
(camp) is known to mediate the effects of transmitters and hormones in a variety of organs
it has seemed reasonable to several investigators that cyclic nucleotides might be involved
although increased electrical activity
in regulating the synthesis of th4g-51 and dbh. 52*53
has been shown to raise the concentration of camp in ganglia5* the role of the nucleotides
in regulating the synthesis of th and dbh is highly controversial.
 xxxg1564xxx  is another substance which appears to be involved in regulating
the synthesis of enzymes in adrenergic neurons. when it is administered to newborn rats,
for example, it can cause a selective induction of th and dbh. the increase in the
activities of these enzymes is far greater than is that of other enzymes.55
hormones also appear to be involved in regulating neurotransmitter synthesis in adrenergic neurons. if a rat is hypophysectomized there is a marked fall in th56 dbh5’, and
pnmt68 activities in the adrenal gland. the decrease in  xxxg1791xxx  can be reversed by acth
or by large amounts of steroids, while that of the other two enzymes is not affected by
exogenous steroids, but is partially or completely reversed by acth.
in summary, the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway is extremely complex. as more
work is done on adrenergic neurons we are likely to find that regulation takes place at
many of the steps, and by many of the mechanisms which have been discussed above. it is
also likely that regulatory processes which have not yet been considered will be implicated
in the control of the synthesis of the biogenic amines. if catecholamines turn out to be
involved in the genesis of one or more of the psychoses then it may be important for us to
understand these regulatory mechanisms both in terms of unraveling the genesis of these
disorders and in terms of the development of therapeutic approaches.
