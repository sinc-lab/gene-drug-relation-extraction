summary
the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors (ppars)
are nuclear receptors for  xxxd2154xxx  (fas) that regulate
glucose and lipid homeostasis. we report the crystal
structure of the  xxxg1806xxx  ligand-binding domain (lbd)
bound to either the fa  xxxd2318xxx  (epa)
or the synthetic fibrate  xxxd1348xxx . the carboxylic acids
of epa and  xxxd1348xxx  interact directly with the activation
function 2 (af-2) helix. the hydrophobic tail of epa
adopts two distinct conformations within the large hydrophobic cavity.  xxxd1348xxx  occupies essentially the
same space as epa bound in both conformations.
these structures provide molecular insight into the
propensity for ppars to interact with a variety of synthetic and natural compounds, including fas that vary
in both chain length and degree of saturation.
introduction
dysregulation of fatty acid (fa) levels is characteristic of
some of the most prevalent medical disorders, including
obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes.
several classes of drugs reduce elevated levels of circulating fas in patients, including the fibrates and thiazolidinediones (tzds) (catapano, 1992; spiegelman, 1998).
the fibrates and tzds mediate their effects through binding to the ppars (peroxisome proliferator–activated receptors), members of the steroid/retinoid nuclear receptor
family of ligand-activated transcription factors (willson
and wahli, 1997). three closely related mammalian
ppar subtypes (a, g, and d) have been identified. ppars
regulate the expression of target genes by binding to
dna sequence elements as heterodimers with the 9-cis
 xxxd3417xxx  receptors (rxrs) (schoonjans et al., 1997).
whereas the hypolipidemic actions of the fibrates appear to be primarily mediated through  xxxg1805xxx , the lipidand glucose-lowering effects of the tzds are mediated
through  xxxg1807xxx  (willson and wahli, 1997). although
the biology of  xxxg1806xxx  is the least well understood of the
ppars, this subtype activates transcription through the
same type of response elements as  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1807xxx 
and presumably also modulates lipid and/or glucose
homeostasis (schmidt et al., 1992; kliewer et al., 1994).
various natural fas and eicosanoids also serve as

ligands for the ppar subtypes (göttlicher et al., 1992;
yu et al., 1995; forman et al., 1997; kliewer et al., 1997;
krey et al., 1997). interestingly, several unsaturated fas
that activate the ppars in vitro have pharmacological
effects similar to those reported for the synthetic ppar
ligands. for example, polyunsaturated fas (pufas)
commonly found in fish oils, including epa and docosahexaenoic acid, have lipid-lowering effects and enhance
insulin sensitivity in humans and rodents (grundy and
denke, 1990; nestel, 1990; storlien et al., 1997). based
upon these observations and the promiscuous ligandbinding properties of the ppars, it has been suggested
that these receptors serve as physiological sensors of
lipid levels, linking fa concentrations to glucose and
lipid homeostasis (forman et al., 1997; kliewer et al.,
1997; krey et al., 1997).
the molecular basis for the binding promiscuity of the
ppars to amphipathic acids has remained unclear. in
this report, we describe the crystal structure of the
 xxxg1806xxx  lbd (ligand-binding domain) in the absence of
ligand or bound to the natural fatty acid epa or the
synthetic fibrate  xxxd1348xxx  (brown et al., 1997). these
structures provide insights into the promiscuous binding
properties of the ppars and the molecular mechanisms
underlying their activation.
results and discussion
structure of the apo  xxxg1806xxx  lbd
we determined the crystal structure of the apo  xxxg1806xxx 
lbd by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of  xxxg1807xxx  as the initial model (nolte et al., 1998).
the molecular replacement solution was confirmed with
a crystal derived from protein containing selenomethionines (table 1). the apo  xxxg1806xxx  lbd folds into a single
domain that contains a bundle of 13 a helices and four
small stranded b strands with an overall structure that
resembles the lbds of  xxxg1998xxx  (bourguet et al., 1995), thyroid  xxxg1603xxx  a (tra) (wagner et al., 1995),
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor g ( xxxg1933xxx ) (renaud et al., 1995),
 xxxg730xxx  a (era) (brzozowski et al., 1997),  xxxg1737xxx  (pr) (williams and sigler, 1998), and
 xxxg1807xxx  (nolte et al., 1998) (figures 1a and 1b). the helices were numbered according to the convention established by the rxr lbd crystal structure (bourguet et
al., 1995), and the amino acid numbers correspond to
the  xxxg1807xxx  lbd structure (nolte et al., 1998) to aid comparison. helices 4, 5, 8, and 9 are sandwiched between
helices 1, 3, 7, and 10 at the top half of the lbd (figures
1a and 1b). helices 3, 7, and 10 form the scaffold for the
large cavity of the ligand-binding site, which is present in
the bottom half of the protein (figure 1c). the ligandbinding pocket is a very large cavity within the protein
with a total volume of z1300 å3, which is comparable
to that of  xxxg1807xxx  (nolte et al., 1998) but substantially
larger than those found in other nuclear receptors (bourguet et al., 1995; renaud et al., 1995; wagner et al.,
1995; brzozowski et al., 1997; williams and sigler, 1998).
the borders of the pocket are defined by helices 4 and

5 on the top, helices 7 and 10 in the back, and helix 3
in the front. the pocket is sealed on the left by the
c-terminal helix that contains the af-2 transcriptional
activation domain and on the right side by helix 1 and

the small b sheet. the bottom portion of the pocket is
sealed by helix 29, a helix that is also present in the
 xxxg1807xxx  structure but absent in the lbd structures of
other nuclear receptors. the presence of helix 29 and
its connecting loop regions may increase the size of
the ligand-binding pocket and may provide a channel
through which ligands can enter the pocket (figure 1d).
the ligand-binding pocket of  xxxg1806xxx  assumes roughly
a “y” shape with each of the three arms approximately
12 å in length (figure 1c). the left arm of the y is composed of a mix of hydrophobic residues ( xxxd2091xxx , f327,
 xxxd2112xxx , f282, f360, i363, and i364) and polar residues
(k367, h323, h449, t289 and q286,  xxxd228xxx , and t292)
and is capped by two residues from the af-2 helix (l369
and y473). this is the only arm of the y that is substantially polar in character. the right arm of the y is composed of the hydrophobic residues l339, i333, l334,
f226, m228, f329, l330, and f368 and is sealed by
f226, the last residue of helix 1, and m228 from the loop
between helices 1 and 2. the third arm of the y-shaped
pocket is composed of the hydrophobic residues l353,
l356, v341, v348, i249, f352, l255, i277, v281 and several polar residues, t288, r284, and w264. finally, residues l255 from helix 29 and i249 from the b sheet s1
seal the bottom tip of this arm. the interior of the ligandbinding pocket is accessible via a channel that is exposed to solvent at roughly the point where the arms
of the y meet (figure 1d). the channel entrance, which

 xxxd2154xxx  were tested for their ability to compete with radioligands for binding to  xxxg1805xxx , g, and d using an spa assay as previously described
(nichols et al., 1998). [3h]gw2331, [3h] xxxd3147xxx , and [3h] xxxd1348xxx  were used as radioligands for  xxxg1805xxx , g, and d competition binding assays,
respectively.  xxxd2154xxx  were tested as competitors in 0.5 logarithmic steps at concentrations ranging from 0.001 mm to 100 mm, and ic50
values were determined as previously described (nichols et al. 1998).

is approximately 100 å2 in area, is surrounded by polar
side chains including  xxxd225xxx , w264, r284, t288, e291,
and e295. the presence of a very flexible loop between
helices 29 and 3 (figure 1c) suggests that the channel
opening has the potential to be even larger and, furthermore, indicates that ligands may be able to enter the
binding pocket without significantly changing the overall
structure of the lbd.

binding of fas to the ppar subtypes
recent studies performed with a variety of techniques
and ppars from various species showed that a number
of fas, including saturated and unsaturated fas, bind
and activate the three ppar subtypes at micromolar
concentrations (forman et al., 1997; kliewer et al., 1997;
krey et al., 1997). many of the fas are found at these concentrations in serum and tissues (jungling and kammermeier, 1988). in order to more thoroughly understand
the structure–activity relationship between fas and the
ppars, we used a scintillation proximity competition
binding assay (nichols et al., 1998) to systematically evaluate fas for their ability to bind to the three human ppar
subtypes. two tritiated fibrate molecules, [3h]gw2331
(kliewer et al., 1997) and [3h] xxxd1348xxx  (brown et al., 1997),
were used as radioligands for  xxxg1805xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx , respectively, and the tritiated thiazolidinedione [3h] xxxd3147xxx 
(lehmann et al., 1995) was used as a  xxxg1807xxx  radioligand.
gw2331, gw2443, and  xxxd3147xxx  displaced bound radioligand in the scintillation proximity assays for  xxxg1805xxx ,
d, and g with ki values of 17 6 2 nm, 50 6 7 nm, and 70 6
12 nm, respectively (data not shown). in competition
binding assays, saturated fas containing 12 carbon
atoms or fewer were unable to interact with the three
ppars (table 2). saturated fas with chain lengths from
14 to 16 carbon units in length bound to  xxxg1805xxx  with
ic50 values ranging from 1.1–5.4 mm, and more weakly
with  xxxg1806xxx  (ic50 values ranging from 6–24 mm). these
saturated fas failed to interact efficiently with  xxxg1807xxx 
(table 2). saturated fas with a chain length of 20 or

more carbon units failed to bind well with any of the
ppars (table 2).
consistent with earlier studies (forman et al., 1997;
kliewer et al., 1997; krey et al., 1997), unsaturated fas
bound to all three ppar subtypes. of the molecules
tested, the pufas g-linolenic (18:3), eicosatrienoic
acid (c20:3), dihomo-g-linolenic (20:3),  xxxd208xxx 
( xxxd208xxx ), and  xxxd2318xxx  (c20:5) interacted
most efficiently with  xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  (table 2). in
general, these pufas interacted more efficiently with
 xxxg1807xxx  than with  xxxg1806xxx . although these pufas bound
to  xxxg1805xxx , they generally were not better competitors
than the saturated and monounsaturated fas with the
corresponding carbon length (table 2). thus,  xxxg1805xxx  is
the most promiscuous of the ppars, interacting with
both saturated and unsaturated fas;  xxxg1806xxx  interacts
with saturated and unsaturated fas, albeit less efficiently than  xxxg1805xxx ; and  xxxg1807xxx  shows the most restricted fa binding profile, interacting most efficiently
with pufas and only weakly with monounsaturated fas.

structure of epa bound to  xxxg1806xxx 
we next solved the cocrystal structure of  xxxg1806xxx  bound
to epa. epa was selected because it binds efficiently
to all three ppars (table 2) and activates these receptors in cell-based assays (forman et al., 1997; krey et al.,
1997). furthermore, epa and mixtures of fas containing
epa lower triglyceride levels and enhance insulin sensitivity in animal models and humans, effects similar to
those of the fibrates and tzds (nestel, 1990; rambjor
et al., 1996; storlien et al., 1997). thus, epa might function as a naturally occurring dietary hormone for the
ppars.
remarkably, epa occupied the ligand-binding pocket
of  xxxg1806xxx  in two distinct conformations (figure 2a–2c).
the acid group and first eight carbon units adopted
essentially the same configuration in both conformations. however, the hydrophobic tail of epa was in two
alternate configurations. in the first of the two binding

modes, the hydrophobic tail was bent upward into the
upper arm of the y-shaped pocket (figure 2a). epa was
completely buried within the lbd in this tail-up configuration. in the second binding mode, the hydrophobic
tail of epa was bent downward into the bottom arm of
the binding pocket (figure 2a). in this tail-down configuration, epa was partially exposed to solvent via the open
channel. in each docking mode, epa occupied a volume
of approximately 300 å3, which is only roughly 30% of
the accessible pocket. there were two  xxxg1806xxx  lbd molecules per asymmetric unit in the cocrystals, and epa
docked in virtually the same two configurations in both
proteins, arguing that the different binding modes for
epa are not simply a consequence of the crystal packing
environment but are instead the result of the flexibility
of the fa hydrocarbon tail and the large size of the
 xxxg1806xxx  ligand-binding cavity.
the binding of epa in both configurations was stabilized through a combination of hydrogen bonds and
hydrophobic interactions (figures 2b and 2c). the acid
group of epa was oriented toward the af-2 helix and
held in place through a network of hydrogen bonds that
involved the side chains of residues h323, h449, and
y473, and hydrophobic interactions with t289 and l469
(figure 2b). l469 and y473 are located in the middle of
the af-2 helix. the same network of hydrogen bonds
occurs in the ternary complex of  xxxg1807xxx  and rosiglitazone in the ternary complex with  xxxg1510xxx  (nolte et al.,
1998). the remarkable conservation of this network of
hydrogen bonds suggests that it must be crucial for
ligand-mediated activation of these receptors. we propose that the active ppar conformation may be accessible in the absence of ligand, but that it is not sufficiently

stable to allow recruitment of the coactivators required
for transcriptional activation. the binding of a natural
or synthetic hormone shifts the equilibrium toward the
active configuration via direct stabilization of the af-2
helix through h bond and hydrophobic interactions with
the ligand. the resulting stabilized receptor conformation permits recruitment of the coactivator protein
through interaction with the charge clamp domain associated with af-2 (nolte et al., 1998).
in both binding modes, the hydrophobic tail of epa
was stabilized through numerous hydrophobic interactions with  xxxg1806xxx  (figure 2c). these data explain why
 xxxg1806xxx  binds only to fas of a certain chain length. short
fas (c , 14) could not make the hydrophobic interactions that are required for stable ligand binding. longchain fas (c . 20) could not fit into the pocket in either
docking mode and would be exposed to the destabilizing effects of solvent. we used molecular modeling to
help understand the role of desaturation for efficient fa
binding to  xxxg1806xxx . it is known that saturated alkyl chains
normally prefer a fully extended, all-trans conformation.
the convoluted  xxxg1806xxx -binding pocket forces the hydrophobic tail of epa into a highly contorted conformation. the five cis double bonds in the epa molecule
facilitate its folding within the pocket by introducing
kinks into the hydrocarbon chain. quantum mechanics
calculations were carried out to define the conformational preferences of a pair of single bonds flanked by
cis double bonds. the results were summarized with
a ramachandran plot (figure 2d) where the observed
single-bond conformations phi and c of the epa molecules in the crystal were plotted over the calculated
energy surface. whereas single bonds in a fully saturated hydrocarbon prefer a trans (1808) conformation,

structure.  xxxg1807xxx  (blue, carbon) and  xxxg1806xxx 
(yellow, carbon) amino acid side chains are
denoted in different colors. the polar headgroups form the same key hydrogen bonds in
 xxxg1807xxx  and  xxxg1806xxx  that are essential for stabilizing the coactivator motif–binding pocket.

the ramachandran plot (figure 2d) shows that the cis
double bonds shift the single-bond preference toward
a skew (1208 or 2408) conformation. most of the phi,c
pairs in the epa molecule in the crystal structure adopt
low-energy skew conformations. the three phi,c pairs
with higher energy were near the ends of the hydrocarbon chains, where multiple low-energy chain conformations could exist within the observed electron density.
thus, the epa molecule adopts the observed kinked
conformations with little energy penalty. by contrast,
docking calculations with arachidic acid, the c20 saturated analog of epa, indicated that approximately 6
of the 17 single bonds must be turned to a gauche
conformation to fit into the  xxxg1806xxx -binding pocket. each
gauche bond raises the energy of the bound conformer
by about 0.9 kcal (wiberg and murcko, 1988), a penalty
that directly reduces the binding affinity of the saturated
fas relative to the unsaturated fas.
structure of the fibrate  xxxd1348xxx  bound to  xxxg1806xxx 
the fibrate class of lipid-lowering drugs were originally
synthesized as metabolically stable analogs of branched
chain fas (thorpe, 1963). through synthesis of biased
chemical libraries of fibrates, we recently identified
a high-affinity ligand for  xxxg1806xxx ,  xxxd1348xxx  (figure 3c)
(brown et al., 1997). in order to compare the mode of
binding of a fibrate with that of a fa, we solved the
cocrystal structure of  xxxd1348xxx  bound to  xxxg1806xxx  (figure
3a). the  xxxd1348xxx  carboxylate group is located in the
same position and orientation as the epa carboxylate
group and forms the same network of hydrogen bonds
with h323, h449, and y473 (figure 3b). notably, the
 xxxd1348xxx  headgroup adopts a conformation in which the
carboxylate and phenyl substituents of the fibrate c-o

bond adopt a gauche relationship. quantum mechanics
calculations indicate that this gauche conformation is
the global minimum for fibrate molecules that contain
gem-dimethyl substituents adjacent to the carboxylic
acid. thus, the fibrate headgroup can adopt the required
binding conformation with no energy penalty. an additional benefit of the gem-dimethyl substituents adjacent
to the carboxylate is their favorable hydrophobic interaction with the pocket formed by helices 3, 7, 10, and
11 (figure 3a). an overlay of bound  xxxd1348xxx  and epa
in both of its configurations is shown in figure 3b. the
two urea substituents of  xxxd1348xxx  project into the two
cavities occupied by the hydrophobic tail of epa in its
two different binding conformations and make many of
the same hydrophobic interactions (figure 3b). thus,
 xxxd1348xxx  closely mimics the binding properties of a natural fa. the high affinity of  xxxd1348xxx  for the  xxxg1806xxx  lbd
is likely the consequence of its ability to interact with
both of these pockets simultaneously.
summary and perspectives
we have provided a detailed structural analysis of the
binding of an fa and fibrate to  xxxg1806xxx . two features
distinguish the binding of these amphipathic carboxylates to  xxxg1806xxx  from other nuclear receptor-ligand interactions. first, the carboxylic acids of both epa and
 xxxd1348xxx  make an intricate series of hydrogen bonds
with the receptor that includes y473 in the af-2 helix.
this same network of hydrogen bonds is seen in the
binding of rosiglitazone to  xxxg1807xxx  (nolte et al., 1998)
(figure 3d). we propose that these highly conserved
hydrogen bonds stabilize the af-2 helix in a conformation that is permissive for interactions with coactivator
proteins. this mode of binding contrasts with that of

molecular cell
402

 xxxd3417xxx  and thyroid hormone to their cognate nuclear receptors, in which the carboxylic acid of the ligand
is oriented away from the af-2 helix of receptor. second,
the ligand-binding pocket of  xxxg1806xxx  is sufficiently large
to allow the hydrophobic tail of epa and presumably
other amphipathic acids to bind in multiple configurations. we speculate that these alternate binding modes
may allow separation of different functional activities
such as transactivation and transrepression (ricote et
al., 1998). thus, the epa/ xxxg1806xxx  cocrystal structure provides a molecular explanation for the ability of ppars to
“sense” a variety of  xxxd2154xxx  and regulate transcription
accordingly. finally, we show that a fibrate ppar ligand
mimics the dual binding modes of the naturally occurring
fa epa. we believe that these insights provided by the
ppar lbd structures can be combined with knowledge
about the compounds that bind to ppars in order to
design more effective drugs for the treatment of diseases of impaired lipid and glucose homeostasis.
experimental procedures
protein preparation
the  xxxg1806xxx  ligand-binding domain (genbank amino acids 165–441
that corresponds to amino acids 201–477 for  xxxg1807xxx ) tagged with
mkkghhhhhhg was expressed from the t7 promoter of plasmid
vector prseta. bl21(de3) cells transformed with this expression
vector were grown in lb to an od600 of approximately 1.0 and induced with 1 mm iptg for 3 hr at room temperature. cells were
harvested, resuspended with 20 ml buffer a (20 mm hepes, [ph
7.5], 50 mm imidazole, 250 mm nacl) per liter of cells, and sonicated
for 10 min on ice. the broken cells were centrifuged at 40,000 g for
30 min, and the supernatant was loaded on a 100 ml ni-agarose
column. the column was washed with 200 ml buffer a and eluted
with a 600 ml gradient to buffer b (20 mm hepes [ph 7.5], 500 mm
imidazole, 250 mm nacl). the  xxxg1806xxx  lbd, which eluted at 50%
buffer b, was diluted with one volume of buffer c (20 mm hepes
[ph 7.5], 10 mm dtt) and loaded on a 100 ml s-sepharose column.
the column was washed with  xxxd3426xxx  ml gradient to buffer d (20 mm
hepes [ph 7.5], 10 mm dtt, 1 m ammonium acetate). the  xxxg1806xxx 
lbd eluted from the column at 70% buffer d. the protein was
concentrated to approximately a 5 ml volume and was loaded onto
a 500 ml superdex 200 column with buffer e (20 mm hepes [ph
7.5], 10 mm dtt, 500 mm ammonium acetate). at this stage, the
protein was .90% pure as determined by sds-page analysis. this
protein was concentrated to 10 mg/ml, aliquoted, and stored at
2808c. to prepare protein–ligand complexes, we added either epa
or  xxxd1348xxx  at a molar ratio of 25:1 (epa) or 5:1 ( xxxd1348xxx ) to protein
from the s-sepharose fraction, and concentrated the protein to
approximately 10 mg/ml. selenium methionine–labeled protein was
prepared with the same protocol except that the cells were grown
in m9 medium with 100 mg of selenium methionyl per liter. approximately 80 mg of unlabeled protein or 10 mg of selenium methionine–
labeled protein was obtained from 12 liters of cells.
crystallization and data collection
all of the crystals in this study were grown at room temperature
with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. the initial drops were
set up with 3 ml of protein or protein–ligand complex, and 3 ml of
well buffer (40 mm bis-tris-propandiol, 10 mm dtt, 2.5% propandiol,
1 mm edta, 0.5% heptyl-b-d-glucopyranoside, 200 mm kcl, and
5% peg 8000). crystals grew in 1 week to about 200 mm in dimension. for data collection, crystals were transiently mixed with 3 vol
of 35% monomethyl-peg 3500, then flash cooled in a stream of
nitrogen gas at about 21808c.
the crystals formed in space group p21, with a 5 39.4 å, b 5
93.5 å, c 5 96.5 å, and b 5 988. each asymmetric unit contained two
protein molecules with 55% solvent content. data were collected on
a rigaku r-axis ii image plate and were reduced, merged, and

scaled with denzo (otwinowski et al., 1993) and scalepack (otwinowski et al., 1993). the quality of data sets are summarized in
table 1.
structure determination and refinement
the monomer structure of  xxxg1807xxx  lbd was used as the initial model
for molecular replacement search with the xplor program
(brünger, 1992)  xxxd1891xxx –4.0 å resolution. the resulting model showed
two distinct solutions with a correlation value of 0.18 and an r factor
of 52%, in agreement with two molecules per asymmetric unit. the
dimeric model of the  xxxg1807xxx  structure failed to give a clear answer
in the molecular replacement search, suggesting that the  xxxg1806xxx 
molecules have a very different dimeric conformation. the two solutions were combined, and the new model yielded a correlation value
of 0.24 and an r factor of 48%. after a cycle of refinement with
rigid body, position, and restricted b factor routine from xplor
(brünger, 1992), the r factor was reduced to 38% with an r free of
46%. the correctness of the model was confirmed by the positions
of methionines with data sets from crystals of seleno-methionine
protein using difference fourier methods (data not shown). the
amino acids in the model were then changed to the corresponding
sequence of  xxxg1806xxx ; however, the amino acid numbers were maintained to be consistent with the amino acid numbers of  xxxg1807xxx .
refinement was continued with xplor (brünger, 1992) and manual
model rebuilding. the current model contains two molecules of the
 xxxg1806xxx  protein (residues 210–475) with good stereochemistry. the
cocrystal structures were determined by molecular replacement
with the apo  xxxg1806xxx  structure, and the refined statistics are shown
in table 1.
fa binding assays
scintillation proximity assays (spa) were performed as previously
described for  xxxg1807xxx  (nichols et al., 1998). in brief, the  xxxg1805xxx , g, and
d ligand-binding domains were expressed in e. coli as polyhistidinetagged fusion proteins. the proteins were purified, biotinylated, and
immobilized on streptavidin-modified spa beads. [3h]gw2331
(kliewer et al., 1997), [3h] xxxd3147xxx  (lehmann et al., 1995), and
[3h] xxxd1348xxx  (brown et al., 1997) were used as radioligands for determination of binding to  xxxg1805xxx , g, and d, respectively. the buffer for
all assays was 50 mm hepes (ph 7), 50 mm kcl, 5 mm chaps,
0.1 mg/mg bsa, and 10 mm dtt.
