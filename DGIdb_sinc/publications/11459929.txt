tyramine, ␤-phenylethylamine, tryptamine, and octopamine are
biogenic amines present in trace levels in mammalian nervous
systems. although some ‘‘trace amines’’ have clearly defined roles
as neurotransmitters in invertebrates, the extent to which they
function as true neurotransmitters in vertebrates has remained
speculative. using a degenerate pcr approach, we have identified
15 g protein-coupled receptors (gpcr) from human and rodent
tissues. together with the orphan receptor pnr, these receptors
form a subfamily of rhodopsin gpcrs distinct from, but related to
the classical biogenic amine receptors. we have demonstrated that
two of these receptors bind and兾or are activated by trace amines.
the cloning of mammalian gpcrs for trace amines supports a role
for trace amines as neurotransmitters in vertebrates. three of the
four human receptors from this family are present in the amygdala,
possibly linking trace amine receptors to affective disorders. the
identification of this family of receptors should rekindle the investigation of the roles of trace amines in mammalian nervous systems
and may potentially lead to the development of novel therapeutics
for a variety of indications.

n

orepinephrine (ne), dopamine (da), and serotonin (5ht) are classical biogenic amine neurotransmitters whose
well characterized effects are mediated by interactions with
subfamilies of receptors that belong to the rhodopsin superfamily of g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs). in addition to these
classical amines, there exists a class of ‘‘trace amines’’ that are
found in very low levels in mammalian tissues, and include
tyramine, ␤-phenylethylamine (␤-pea), tryptamine, and octopamine (1). the rapid turnover of trace amines, as evidenced by
their dramatic increases following treatment with monoamine
oxidase (mao) inhibitors or deletion of the mao genes,
suggests that the levels of trace amines at neuronal synapses may
be considerably higher than predicted by steady-state measures
(2–5). the role of trace amines as neurotransmitters in invertebrates is well established and octopamine is thought to be the
sympathetic nervous system counterpart to ne (6–9). gpcrs
for tyramine and octopamine have been cloned from both insects
(10–14) and mollusks (15, 16).
although there is clinical literature that supports a role for trace
amines in depression as well as other psychiatric disorders and
migraine (2, 3, 17–20), the role of trace amines as neurotransmitters
in mammalian systems has not been thoroughly examined. because
they share common structures with the classical amines and can
displace other amines from their storage vesicles, trace amines have
been referred to as ‘‘false transmitters’’ (21). thus, many of the
effects of trace amines are indirect and are caused by the release of
endogenous classical amines. however, there is a growing body
of evidence suggesting that trace amines function independently of
classical amine transmitters and mediate some of their effects via
specific receptors (for review, see refs. 22–24). saturable, highaffinity binding sites for [3h]tryptamine (23, 25–27), p-[3h]tyramine (28–30), and ␤-[3h]pea (31) have been reported in rat brain,
and both the pharmacology and localization of these sites suggest
that they are distinct from the amine transporters. however,
although binding sites in brain and other tissues have been reported,

no specific receptors for these trace amines have yet been identified
conclusively.
we now report the identification of a family of related mammalian gpcrs of which two members have been shown to specifically
bind and兾or be activated by trace amines.  xxxg2239xxx  is activated most
potently by tyramine and ␤-pea, and ta2 is activated most
potently by ␤-pea. the 15 distinct receptors described here, along
with the orphan receptor pnr (32) and the pseudogenes gpr58,
gpr57 (33), and the  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene (34), share a high degree
of sequence homology and together form a subfamily of rhodopsin
gpcrs distinct from but related to 5-ht, da, and ne receptors.
we further describe the localization of  xxxg2239xxx  in human and rodent
tissues, as well as the chromosomal localization of the human
members of this family. the identification of this family of receptors
should facilitate the understanding of the roles of trace amines in
the mammalian nervous system.

results
in an attempt to identify additional 5-ht1-like receptors, such as
the elusive 5-ht1p receptor (38), degenerate pcr primers were
designed against tms vi and vii of an alignment of 5-ht1
receptors and used to amplify rat genomic dna at reduced
stringency. one product from this reaction was found to be a
dna sequence, not found in the genbank database, with
42–48% amino acid identity to  xxxg1117xxx , da d2, and ␤-adrenergic
receptors. sequencing of the corresponding full-length cdna,
bo111, revealed an orf of 996 bp that is predicted to encode
a protein of 332 aa (fig. 1, rat  xxxg2239xxx ). an allelic variant of this
receptor was also identified wherein a glutamine replaces a
leucine at position 170. bo111 is most closely related to gpr58
(50% aa identity), the human  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene (47% aa
identity, with frame shifts ‘‘corrected’’), bo107 (an orphan
gpcr previously identified at synaptic and later renamed ta3)
and gpr57 (45% aa identities), pnr (38% aa identity), and
 xxxg1110xxx ,  xxxg1117xxx , and 5-ht7 receptors (35–37% aa identities).
human and mouse orthologues of bo111 were obtained by
standard methods. the amino acid sequences of the human and
mouse receptors are 76% identical to each other and 79% and
87% identical to the rat receptor, respectively (fig. 1).
a search for the endogenous ligand for the receptor encoded
by bo111 was performed by expressing it in oocytes along with
mrna encoding the camp-responsive cl channel, cftr.
candidate ligands were tested in eleven groups of five. from this
broad panel, octopamine and, more weakly, da and 5-ht,

thus named  xxxg2239xxx . no such currents were observed in oocytes
injected with only mrna encoding the cftr channel. oocytes
expressing rat  xxxg2239xxx  without cftr failed to generate inward

currents (fig. 2c; n ⫽ 11), suggesting that stimulation of rat  xxxg2239xxx 
by octopamine and tyramine resulted in the generation of camp
leading to cftr channel opening, presumably via activation of
the endogenous xenopus g protein g␣s. oocytes expressing the
human orthologue of rat  xxxg2239xxx  with cftr also produced inward
currents in response to application of 100 nm tyramine (fig. 2d).

the ta receptors, along with gpr57, gpr58,  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene,
and pnr, branch separately from mammalian receptors for classical biogenic amines, including those for 5-ht, and from the
invertebrate trace amine receptors. within this large family of
receptors, there appears to be at least two subfamilies.  xxxg2239xxx  and
ta2, along with gpr57, gpr58, and  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene, constitute one subfamily, and ta3–ta15 constitute a second subfamily.
radiation hybrid mapping using primers selective for  xxxg2239xxx ,

and tyramine is shown in table 1. the rank order of potency was
similar between the binding and functional assays, although the
ki values determined from binding displacement were ⬇6-fold
lower than ec50 values determined in functional studies. this
difference has been reported for many exogenously expressed
receptors, including the 5-ht7 receptor (39), and may be due to
the relatively low expression levels of  xxxg2239xxx  in cos-7 cells, weak
coupling of the receptor to signaling components in these cells,
or differences in assay conditions.
additional degenerate pcr work performed on rat genomic
dna led to the identification of ta2. ta2 is most similar to the
human  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene (82% aa identity with frame shifts
‘‘corrected’’), and shares 48–51% aa identity to the rat and
human  xxxg2239xxx  receptors (fig. 1), gpr57 and gpr58. the expression of rat ta2 in cos-7 cells resulted in an increase in camp
accumulation, presumably via g␣s-class g protein(s). of the
biogenic amines tested, only ␤-pea and tryptamine activated
this receptor; however, the response was of low potency [ec50 ⫽
1.9 ⫾ 0.5 ␮m (fig. 3) and 17 ⫾ 2 ␮m (data not shown)
respectively]. the low potency of trace amines for rat ta2 in
heterologous expression systems may be explained by its poor
surface expression, as determined by subcellular localization of
an epitope-tagged rat ta2 (data not shown). alternatively, other
more potent agonists may exist for rat ta2. because the human
orthologue of this receptor is most likely the  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene,
no further studies were conducted on rat ta2.
further degenerate pcr work led to the identification of ta5
from human genomic dna, and ta4, ta7, ta8, and ta9 from
rat genomic dna. while isolating these full-length receptors
from genomic libraries, several additional closely related receptors were also isolated, including human ta4 and rat ta6, ta10,
ta11, ta12, ta13, ta14, and ta15. ta4–ta15 are highly homologous to each other, with overall aa identities of 62–96% (see
fig. 6, which is published as supplemental data on the pnas web
site, www.pnas.org). these receptors are 66–73% identical to
ta3, 41–48% identical to ta2, 40–44% identical to  xxxg2239xxx , and
28–36% identical to 5-ht receptors. as indicated in fig. 1, there
are 74 residues that are completely conserved in  xxxg2239xxx –ta15. of
these, 52 are uniquely conserved in the trace amine family
(closed triangles), 18 (of 25) are also conserved in all human
monoaminergic receptors (open triangles), and an additional 4
(of 32) are conserved with human 5-ht receptors, but not ne
or da receptors (open circles).
a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the aa sequences of
 xxxg2239xxx –ta15, pnr, gpr57, gpr58, the  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene, and
several vertebrate and invertebrate aminergic receptors (fig. 4).

lung, and small intestine, whereas trace amounts (⬍15) were
expressed in cerebellum, dorsal root ganglia, hippocampus,
hypothalamus, liver, medulla, pancreas, pituitary, pontine reticular formation, prostate, skeletal muscle, and spleen. message
levels for the other human trace amine receptors were also
detected in low levels. ta3 mrna was detected only in kidney.
ta4 and ta5 mrna were expressed in kidney and amygdala,
and ta4 was also detected in the hippocampus.
a widespread and unique distribution of  xxxg2239xxx  mrna was
revealed in the mouse cns by in situ hybridization histochemistry (fig. 5) and the hybridization signal was localized to the
cytoplasm of neuronal profiles (fig. 5 a and b). several brain
regions exhibited intense labeling specifically, the mitral cell
layer of the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, the arcuate, motor,
and mesencephalic trigeminal nuclei, lateral reticular and hypoglossal nuclei, cerebellar purkinje cells, and ventral horn of the
spinal cord. moderate labeling was evident in the frontal,
entorhinal, and agranular cortices, the ventral pallidum, thalamus, hippocampus, several hypothalamic nuclei, ambiguus, dorsal raphe, and gigantocellular reticular nuclei. weaker staining
was visible in the septum, basal ganglia, amygdala, myelencephalon, and spinal cord dorsal horn. particularly interesting was the
moderate expression of  xxxg2239xxx  mrna in several monoaminergic
cell groups, namely the dorsal raphe (fig. 5d), the locus
coeruleus (fig. 5f), and the ventral tegmental area (fig. 5e).
discussion
we have identified a multigene family of intronless gpcrs and
have demonstrated that  xxxg2239xxx  is potently activated by tyramine
and ␤-pea and displays low affinity for tryptamine, octopamine,
and da. an additional member of this family, ta2, is also

activated by ␤-pea and tryptamine. although the roles of
tyramine and octopamine as neurotransmitters acting via stimulation of g protein-coupled receptors in invertebrate systems
are well established (6–9), mammalian gpcrs for trace amines
have not, to our knowledge, been previously reported. the
present finding lends strong support to a role for trace amines as
neurotransmitters or neuromodulators in vertebrates.

study was the discovery of such a large family of highly related
receptors. in addition to  xxxg2239xxx  and ta2, we have identified 13
other related receptors. these additional receptors, ta3–ta15,
share an unusually high degree of amino acid identity (62–96%).
for comparison, the human 5-ht receptors share 28–63%
amino acid identities. the high degree of homology within
members of the ta family and the tight clustering of the human
ta receptors on chromosome 6q23.2 suggests that these receptors evolved relatively recently, after the invertebrate兾vertebrate
split, and makes it tempting to speculate that this region may
represent a hotspot for gene duplication events.
although the degree of homology between receptors within a
species is extremely high, the degree of amino acid identity
among orthologues is moderate to low. the rat and human
orthologues of ta3 and ta4 share a moderate degree of amino
acid identities (87% and 88%, respectively). however, the
mouse, rat, and human orthologues of  xxxg2239xxx  share a relatively low
degree of homology (87% for rat and mouse, 79% for rat and
human, 76% mouse and human). this observation suggests that
although these receptors are relatively recent expansions of the
genome, they are evolving at a rapid rate.
another interesting observation is that a larger number of rat
receptors has been identified so far as compared with human
receptors. four human receptors have been identified ( xxxg2239xxx ,
ta3, ta4, and ta5), whereas 14 rat receptors have been
identified ( xxxg2239xxx –ta4 and ta6–ta15). to date, only a human
form of pnr has been reported (29). there are also a large
number of pseudogenes within the human members of this
family. the  xxxg1117xxx  pseudogene (31), which we propose should be
renamed ␺ta2, and ␺gpr57 (33) each contain frame shifts
resulting in premature stop codons, whereas ␺gpr58 lacks an
amino terminus (33). although additional human receptors may
ultimately be identified, the striking difference in the number of
rat and human receptors suggests that this family may play very
different roles in different species.
we have demonstrated a functional response to heterologously
expressed  xxxg2239xxx  in both xenopus oocytes and a mammalian cell
system. the response in both assays indicates that  xxxg2239xxx  couples to
the stimulation of adenylate cyclase through a g␣s g protein. the
human  xxxg2239xxx  is activated by tyramine and ␤-pea, less
potently by octopamine, and binds ␤-pea and tyramine with high
affinity and tryptamine, octopamine, and da with lower affinity.
the rat ta2 receptor is activated by ␤-pea and tryptamine, also via
stimulation of a g␣s g protein. thus far, we have not demonstrated
functional responses to tyramine, ␤-pea, tryptamine, octopamine,
or the classical biogenic amines in cos-7 cells expressing ta3–
ta15. this finding may be due to poor trafficking to the plasma
membrane (data not shown), or these receptors may respond to
related, perhaps as yet unidentified, amines. however, the high
degree of sequence conservation between the two subfamilies, the
evolutionary branching analysis, as well as the chromosomal proximity of the receptors make it very likely that ta3–ta15 encode
receptors for trace amines.
human  xxxg2239xxx  mrna is expressed in low to moderate levels in
peripheral tissues such as stomach, kidney, and lung, and within the
cns appears to be restricted primarily to the amygdala. the
expression of  xxxg2239xxx  mrna is lower than that seen for receptors of
classical neurotransmitters, consistent with the low levels of trace
amines relative to other neurotransmitters. all of the human
members of the ta family are expressed in the kidney, supporting
borowsky et al.

a role in blood pressure regulation and electrolyte homeostasis.
this may be related to the ‘‘cheese effect,’’ wherein dietary-induced
elevations in tyramine levels in patients taking mao inhibitors
results in hypertension and migraine (see ref. 19 for review).
the expression of  xxxg2239xxx  mrna in human amygdala is intriguing in light of evidence suggesting a role of trace amines in the
etiology and兾or treatment of depression and anxiety disorders.
a functional deficiency of ␤-pea and tryptamine has been
proposed as a potential etiological factor in depression (40–42),
and increased levels of ␤-pea are associated with the manic
phase of bipolar disease (43). antidepressants that inhibit mao
produce proportionally greater increases in trace amines than
5-ht (2, 3). mao-b knockout mice have increased levels of
␤-pea (7-fold higher), but normal levels of 5-ht, ne, and da
(5). interestingly, mao-b knockout mice show a reduced decrease in mobility in the forced swim test, similar to that induced
by antidepressants (5). taken together, these results suggest that
 xxxg2239xxx  receptors in the amygdala may be an important site of action
for trace amines, particularly ␤-pea, in the etiology and treatment of depression. the expression of mouse  xxxg2239xxx  mrna in the
dorsal raphe, locus ceruleus, and ventral tegmental area indicates that trace amines may modulate the activity of 5-ht, ne,
and da systems and further supports a role for trace amine
receptors in the regulation of mood.
human trace amine receptor genes map to chromosome
6q23.2, close to sczd5, a susceptibility locus for schizophrenia
(6q13-26 with the greatest allele sharing at 6q21-22.3; ref. 44).
because of structural and physiological similarities, ␤-pea has

been described as the body’s endogenous amphetamine (45, 46).
amphetamine produces a paranoid schizophrenic syndrome in
humans, and chronic treatment with either amphetamine or
␤-pea produces a behavioral sensitization in animals (47–51).
moreover, numerous clinical studies have demonstrated elevated urinary levels of ␤-pea in schizophrenic patients (52, 53).
thus, it will be important to delineate the role of ta receptors
in the etiology and treatment of schizophrenia.
although trace amines have long been thought to be neurotransmitters, the understanding of their physiology has lagged that of the
classical biogenic amines, in part, because the receptor targets
remained elusive. the identification of mammalian gpcrs for
trace amines supports a role for trace amines as bona fide neurotransmitters in vertebrates. the localization of mrna for three of
the four human receptors in amygdala lends a potential site of
action for the postulated role of trace amines in the etiology and兾or
treatment of several affective disorders. future characterization of
ta3–ta15 will further enhance our understanding of these receptors. the discovery of this family of receptors provides a means to
evaluate the physiological roles of trace amines in higher species and
their regulation in diseased processes, and to explore potential
therapeutic applications associated with these receptors.
