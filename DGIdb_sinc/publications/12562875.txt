induction of nuclear factor b (nfb) activation and the
expression of inflammatory cytokines (2, 3). ten members of the tlr family have so far been identified in human and mouse, and these tlrs are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues (4–6). however, endogenous
ligands for these tlrs have not been fully identified. genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrated that tlr4
confers the responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide (lps)
derived from gram-negative bacteria (7–9), whereas tlr2
recognizes other bacterial cell wall components, including
bacterial lipoproteins (1–3). other agonists for tlr4
from nonmicrobial origins include  xxxg1106xxx ,
fibronectin, taxol, respiratory syncytical virus coat protein,
and saturated  xxxd2154xxx  (10–14). such a broad spectrum
of tlr4 agonists implies the promiscuous nature of
ligand specificity for this receptor. this leads to the speculation that tlrs have much broader roles than we currently understand.
lipid a, which possesses most of the biological activities
of lps, is acylated with hydroxy saturated  xxxd2154xxx . the
3-hydroxyl groups of these saturated  xxxd2154xxx  are further
3-o-acylated by saturated  xxxd2154xxx . removal of these
o-acylated saturated  xxxd2154xxx  from lipid a not only results in complete loss of endotoxic activity, but also makes
the lipid a act as an antagonist to the native lipid a (15,
16). lipid a(s) containing unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  are also
known to be nontoxic or act as an antagonist against endotoxin (17, 18). it was also demonstrated that the deacylated bacterial lipoproteins were unable to activate tlr2
and to induce cytokine expression in monocytes (19).
these results suggest that the  xxxd2154xxx  acylated on lipid
a or bacterial lipoproteins play a critical role in ligand rec-

abstract human subjects consuming fish oil showed a significant suppression of  xxxg1884xxx  (cox-2) expression in blood monocytes when stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide (lps), an agonist for  xxxg2290xxx 
(tlr4). results with a murine monocytic cell line (raw
264.7) stably transfected with cox-2 promoter reporter
gene also demonstrated that lps-induced cox-2 expression was preferentially inhibited by docosahexaenoic acid
(dha, c22:6n-3) and  xxxd2318xxx  (epa, c20:5n-3),
the major n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas) present
in fish oil. additionally, dha and epa significantly suppressed cox-2 expression induced by a synthetic lipopeptide, a tlr2 agonist. these results correlated with the preferential suppression of lps- or lipopeptide-induced nfb
activation by dha and epa. the target of inhibition by
dha is tlr itself or its associated molecules, but not
downstream signaling components. in contrast, cox-2 expression by tlr2 or trl4 agonist was potentiated by lauric
acid, a saturated fatty acid. these results demonstrate that
inhibition of cox-2 expression by n-3 pufas is mediated
through the modulation of tlr-mediated signaling pathways. thus, the beneficial or detrimental effects of different types of dietary  xxxd2154xxx  on the risk of the development of many chonic inflammatory diseases may be in part
mediated through the modulation of tlrs.—lee, j. y., a.

4 nfb-luciferase reporter construct was purchased from
clontech (palo alto, ca) and used for transient transfection.
heat shock protein 70 (hsp70)--galactosidase reporter plasmid
was from robert modlin (university of california, los angeles,
ca). the expression plasmids for a wild-type tlr2 and a dominant-negative mutant [tlr2(p681h)] were from c. b. wilson
(university of washington, seattle, wa). constitutively active
chimeric cd4-tlr4 was obtained from c. a. janeway, jr. (yale
university, new haven, ct). the constitutively active form of
myeloid differential factor 88 [ xxxg1489xxx (toll)] and the dominant-negative mutant,  xxxg1489xxx (dd), were kindly provided by
jurg tschopp (university of lausanne, switzerland). the wildtype and the dominant-negative mutant of nfb-inducing kinase
(nik) were gifts from m. rothe (tularik, south san francisco,
ca). all dna constructs were prepared in large scale using endofree plasmid maxi kit (qiagen, chatsworth, ca) for transfection.

cell culture
raw 264.7 cells (a murine monocytic cell line, atcc tib-71)
and 293t cells (provided by sam lee, beth israel hospital. boston, ma) were cultured in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium
(dmem) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (fbs, intergen) and 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml
streptomycin (gibco-brl) at 37c in a 5% co2/air environment. raw264.7 cells stably transfected with murine cox-2 promoter (3.2 kb) luciferase plasmid were prepared as described
below. raw264.7 cells stably transfected with a luciferase plasmid containing 5 nfkb binding site were a gift from jianping
ye (pennington biomedical research center, baton rouge, la).
cells were plated in 6-well plates and cultured for an additional
18 h to allow the number of cells to approximately double. cells
were maintained in the serum-poor (0.25% fbs) medium for another 18 h prior to the treatment with indicated reagents.

preparation of stably transfected cells with luciferase
reporter plasmids
raw 264.7 cells (1  106 cells) were plated in 100 mm dish
and transfected with murine cox-2 promoter (3.2 kb) luciferase plasmid using superfect transfection reagent (qiagen)
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. pcdna3/neo was
cotransfected to select transfected cells using the antibiotic. after
48 h of stabilization, the new media containing  xxxd2191xxx  (500
g/ml) was added and changed for appropriate time periods.
two weeks later, the colonies that survived were selected and
propagated under  xxxd2191xxx . after another 2 weeks of antibiotic
selection, the luciferase activities were determined for each colony after treatment with lps (100 ng/ml). the colony that
showed the highest response to lps treatment was selected.

transient transfection and luciferase assay
these were performed as described in our previous studies (9,
14). briefly, raw 264.7 or 293t cells were plated in 6-well plates
(5  105 cells/well) and cotransfected with a luciferase plasmid
containing either murine cox-2 promoter (3.2 kb) or 2
nfkb binding site and hsp70--galactosidase plasmid as an internal control using superfect transfection reagent (quiagen,
valencia, ca) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. various expression plasmids or corresponding empty vector plasmids
for signaling components were cotransfected. the total amount
of transfected plasmids was equalized by supplementing with the
corresponding empty vector in order to eliminate the experimental error from transfection itself. luciferase and -galactosidase enzyme activities were determined using the luciferase
assay system and -galactosidase enzyme system (promega,
madison, wi) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. luciferase activity was normalized by -galactosidase activity.

ognition and receptor activation for tlr2 and tlr4. indeed, it was suggested that the rapid interaction of bacterial lipopeptides with plasma membrane of macrophages
occurs via insertion of their acylated saturated  xxxd2154xxx 
as determined by electron energy loss spectroscopy and
freeze-fracture techniques (20, 21).
results from our previous studies (9) demonstrated
that the ligand independent activation of tlr4 is sufficient to induce the activation of nfb and the expression
of the mitogen-inducible cyclooxygenase (cox-2) in macrophages. furthermore, saturated  xxxd2154xxx  induce nf b
activation and cox-2 expression, but unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  inhibit both saturated fatty acid- and lps-induced
nfb activation, and the expression of cox-2 and other
inflammatory markers in a murine monocytic cell line
(raw 264.7) (14). the inhibition of lps-induced nfb
activation and cox-2 expression by unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  was mediated through the suppression of tlr4derived signaling pathways (14). it was demonstrated that
consuming n-3 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas) leads
to the suppression of the production of lps-induced
proinflammatory cytokines in blood mononuclear cells in
humans (22, 23). however, the mechanism is not understood. both inducible cyclooxygenase (cox-2) and proinflammatory cytokines belong to a family of immediate
early response genes. the expression of immediate early
response genes does not require preceding protein synthesis (24). this suggests that the suppressed expression
of lps-induced proinflammatory cytokines by n-3 pufas
may be mediated by modulation of lps (tlr4 agonist)induced signaling pathways.
thus, we determined whether cox-2 expression is inhibited in lps-stimulated monocytes derived from human
subjects consuming fish oil, and whether this inhibition is
mediated through the modulation of tlr4 signaling pathways by n-3 pufas. if the activation of tlrs is modulated
by the types of  xxxd2154xxx , then signaling pathways downstream of tlrs, target gene expression, and consequent
cellular responses should also be modulated by different
types of  xxxd2154xxx . this modulation has profound implications for the potential role of dietary fat with varying
composition of  xxxd2154xxx  on inflammatory and immune
responses induced by the activation of tlrs that are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues.

human studies to determine whether dietary n-3 pufas
suppress the expression of cox-2 induced by lps in
peripheral blood monocytes
we conducted two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel arm studies in human subjects where the
amounts of dietary n-3 and n-6 pufas were controlled using institutionally prepared diets with fish oil concentrate or placebo
oil capsules. the study protocol was approved by the louisiana
state university institutional review board, and subjects gave
written informed consent. in study i, subjects (7 to 8 per
group) received 9 g of purified fish oil with varying amounts of
linoleic acid (c18:2n-6) for 8 weeks, whereas in study ii, subjects (11 to 12 per group) received varying amount of fish oil
(0, 6, 15g) with a constant amount of linoleic acid for 4 weeks.
the control group received linoleic acid without fish oil supplementation. the studies i and ii were combined to get a broader
range of dose-responses to the intake of fish oil. the data for
the control group in both study i and ii were combined to
make the control group in fig. 1. the data for 9 g of fish oil intake with different amount of linoleic acid in study i were combined with the data for the group receiving 9 g of fish oil in
study ii. thus, numbers of replicates for the control and the
group of 9 g of fish oil intake were approximately two times
greater than those for the groups of 6 g or 15 g of fish oil intake. the combination of the data was based on the fact that
the levels of linoleic acid intake did not affect the production
of pge2. details for the study design and provision of the diets
are described elsewhere (30).

assay for de novo synthesized cox-2 in human monocytes
briefly, monocytes isolated from peripheral blood (31) were
pretreated with aspirin to inactivate any endogenous cox.
newly expressed cox in response to lps (100 ng/ml) stimulation was determined by measuring the production of  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) in the presence of  xxxd208xxx  (aa; 30 m,
above vmax). cox-2, but not cox-1, is selectively expressed in
lps-stimulated macrophages (27). therefore, cox activity as
measured by pge2 production at these conditions reflects de
novo synthesis of cox-2 (25, 27).

fig. 1. dietary intake of fish oil suppresses the expression of
cyclooxygenase (cox)-2 induced by toll-like receptor (tlr)4
agonist [lipopolysaccharide (lps)] in human peripheral blood
monocytes. two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
parallel arm studies were conducted in healthy subjects where
the amounts of dietary n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
(pufas) were controlled using institutionally prepared diets and
fish oil concentrate or placebo oil capsules. fish oil concentrate
or safflower oil was used as a source of n-3 pufas or n-6 pufas
(linoleic acid), respectively. in study i, subjects consumed an
equal amount of fish oil (9 g/day) but varying amounts of the n-6
fatty acid (linoleic acid). in study ii, subjects consumed various
amounts of fish oil (0, 6, 15 g/day) with the constant amount of
linoleic acid. peripheral blood monocytes were isolated, and the
production of  xxxd1903xxx  2 (pge2) induced by lps in monocytes was determined as described in materials and methods. the
levels of pge2 produced in these conditions reflect the amounts
of de novo synthesis of cox-2 protein. combined data for studies
i and ii are presented. values are mean
sem (n
11–21).

oil (p 0.022).

results
adding fish oil containing n-3 pufas to the diet
suppressed the expression of cox-2 in human monocytes
stimulated with lps, an agonist for the  xxxg2290xxx 
here we determined whether the intake of fish oil, a major dietary source of docosahexaenoic acid (dha, c22:6n-3)
and  xxxd2318xxx  (epa, c20:5n-3) leads to suppression of cox-2 expression in human monocytes exposed to lps in vitro.  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2) production
was used as a surrogate maker for cox-2 expression. the
production of pge2 was significantly (p
0.022) suppressed by 15 g of fish oil intake, but not by the lower doses
of intake (fig. 1), suggesting that cox-2 expression by
lps in human monocytes was suppressed by the fish oil
diet.
it has also been demonstrated by other investigators
that the suppression of the production of cytokines (il-2,
il-1, and tnf ) in lps-stimulated human mononuclear
cells by fish oil intake occurred at the dose of 18 g/day for
6 weeks (22, 23). these results indicate that the suppression of cox-2 and cytokine expression by fish oil intake
occurs at high dose levels. since the feeding periods were
relatively short (4–8 weeks), it is possible that the suppression of the expression of cox-2 and cytokines could occur at lower levels of fish oil intake if the experimental period were prolonged.

these were performed essentially the same as previously described (25, 26). for cox-2 and actin immunoblot analyses,
solubilized proteins were subjected to 8% sodium  xxxd3215xxx -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). following
electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a pvdf membrane in
the transfer buffer. the membrane was blocked to prevent nonspecific binding of antibodies in tbs-t [20 mm tris hcl, 137
mm nacl, 0.05% (v/v) tween 20, ph 7.6] containing 5% nonfat
dried milk (nfdm, carnation). cox-2 immunoblotting was
performed using rabbit polyclonal antibody followed by incubation with anti-rabbit igg coupled to horseradish peroxidase
(1:5,000) in 5% nfdm in tbs-t. polyclonal antibodies for
cox-2 were prepared and characterized as described previously
(27, 28). for actin immunoblotting, the membrane used for
cox immunoblot was stripped in the stripping buffer (29) at
56c for 1 h, reprobed with 1:10,000 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (sigma), and followed by incubation with anti-mouse igg coupled to horseradish peroxidase
(1:5,000) in 5% nfdm in tbs-t. the membrane was exposed
on an x-ray film (kodak) using ecl western blot detection reagents (amersham). sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase were purchased from amersham pharmacia biotech
(arlington heights, il).

preferential inhibition by n-3 pufas of lps-induced
nfb activation and cox-2 expression in raw
264.7 cells
to investigate the mechanism by which n-3 pufas inhibit lps-induced cox-2 expression in human blood
monocytes, we determined the relative potency of unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  in inhibiting the tlr-induced signaling
pathway and the target gene expression in murine monocytic cell line (raw 264.7), which is stably transfected with
nfb or cox-2 promoter luciferase reporter gene. these
stably transfected cell lines eliminate the necessity of
transfecting plasmids for the reporter gene and the internal control. thus, inhibitory or stimulatory effects of various  xxxd2154xxx  on agonist-induced tlr activation can be
quantitatively determined in a high throughput mode using 96 well plates. demonstration that lps-induced nfb
activation and cox-2 expression in raw 264.7 cells is mediated through tlr4 was reported previously (9). therefore, we utilized nfb activation and cox-2 expression as
readouts for agonist-induced tlr activation and its suppression or potentiation by  xxxd2154xxx  in raw 264.7 cells
in these studies.
all unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  tested inhibit lps-induced
nfb activation and cox-2 expression as determined by
reporter gene assays (fig. 2a, b). among unsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx , dha and epa are the most potent inhibitors.
this finding corroborates the results from the human
studies described above (fig. 1), and demonstrates that
n-3 pufas (dha and epa) as compared with n-6 pufas
( xxxd208xxx  and linoleic acid) are much more potent inhibitors of tlr4 activation. in contrast, a saturated
fatty acid,  xxxd1921xxx  ( xxxd1921xxx ), potentiates lps-induced
nfb activation and cox-2 expression (fig. 2a, b). results from previous studies showed that saturated  xxxd2154xxx  alone, without other agonists, can induce nfb activation and cox-2 expression in raw 264.7 cells (14).
immunoblot analyses also showed that lps-induced cox-2
expression is suppressed by dha but potentiated by the
saturated fatty acid (fig. 2c). to determine whether unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  inhibit the activation of tlr4 in a reconstituted system, human embryonic kidney cells (293t)
were transfected with a constitutively active form of tlr4
(cd4-tlr4) to activate tlr4-mediated signaling pathways in a ligand-independent manner (4). dha inhibits,
but  xxxd1921xxx  potentiates cd4-tlr4-induced nfb activation
in 293t cells (fig. 3a). these results are consistent with
the results demonstrating the similar pattern of modulation by  xxxd2154xxx  for the ligand-induced activation of
tlr4 in raw264.7 cells (fig. 2).
we next determined whether the target of inhibition by
dha is tlr4 or its downstream signaling components.
one of the common components of the immediate downstream signaling pathways of all tlrs is known to be an
adaptor protein,  xxxg1489xxx  (1–3, 5). the activation of nfb
mediated through  xxxg1489xxx  is one of the major downstream
signaling pathways derived from tlrs. dha does not inhibit nfb activation induced by the activation of downstream component ( xxxg1489xxx  or nik) of tlr signaling
pathways (fig. 3b), while unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  inhibit

strated that pamcag, a synthetic analog of bacterial lipopeptides that are known agonists of tlr2, activates
tlr2 in a reconstituted system using 293t cells that do
not express tlr2 (4, 32). pamcag activates tlr2, as determined by nfb activation and its inhibition by a dominant negative mutant of tlr2 or downstream signaling
component ( xxxg1489xxx  or nik) in tlr2-transfected 293t

discussion
dietary  xxxd2154xxx  can be divided into four major
groups: saturated  xxxd2154xxx  (e.g., lauric, myristic, palmitic, and stearic); monounsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  [e.g., oleic
acid (n-9)]; n-6 pufas (linoleic acid); and n-3 pufas
(e.g.,  xxxd2490xxx ). the unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  can be
converted to longer chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
through a series of desaturation and chain elongation
steps. it is well documented that there is metabolic competition among the three groups of unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx 
at the desaturation steps (33–35). twenty carbon pufas,
such as  xxxd208xxx  (c20:4n-6) and epa (c20:5n-3),
can be enzymatically converted to eicosanoids (36–38).
revelation of diverse pathophysiological actions of eicosanoids has expanded our understanding of how fatty

and b) or cox-2 (c) luciferase reporter plasmid and cotransfected with various expression plasmids as indicated. pcdna3.1, prk, and
pdisplay were transfected as vector controls for dominant negative (dn) mutants of  xxxg1489xxx , nik, and tlr2, respectively. twenty-four hours
after the transfection, cells were stimulated with either vehicle control or pamcag (1 g/ml). after 18 h, luciferase activities were determined. values are mean sem (n 3). wt, wild-type. rla, relative luciferase activity.

cells (fig. 4a). the murine monocytic cell line (raw
264.7) expresses both tlr2 and tlr4 (6). thus, we determined whether pamcag activates endogenous tlr2
in raw 264.7 cells. pamcag induces nfb activation and
expression of cox-2, and this induction was inhibited by
a dominant negative mutant of tlr2 or  xxxg1489xxx  (fig. 4b,
c). these results demonstrate that pamcag activates
both ectopically expressed tlr2 in 293t cells and endogenous tlr2 in raw 264.7 cells.
similar to the results shown with tlr4 agonist (fig. 2),
n-3 pufas, dha, and epa are the most potent inhibitors
among the unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  tested for pamcaginduced nfb activation and cox-2 expression in raw
264.7 cells (fig. 5a–c). the saturated fatty acid ( xxxd1921xxx )
potentiated pamcag-induced nfb activation and cox-2
expression in raw264.7 cells. in addition, dha inhibits,
but  xxxd1921xxx  ( xxxd1921xxx ) potentiates nfb activation induced by pamcag in tlr2-transfected 293t cells (fig.
5d). these results demonstrate the modulatory effects of
the  xxxd2154xxx  on the activation of both tlr2 and tlr4.

acids modulate various cellular responses. mounting evidence now suggests that  xxxd2154xxx  not only are the precursors of eicosanoids and other lipid mediators, but also
can modulate signaling molecules and transcription factors (39–41). elucidating the mechanism of this modulation could help us to understand how different types of dietary fat modify the risks of developing many chronic
diseases.
dha (c22:6n-3) and epa are the major n-3 pufas
present in marine lipids. epidemiological, clinical, and
biochemical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects
of these n-3 pufas in reducing risks of cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, and cancer (42–49). however, the mechanisms by which dietary n-3 pufas exert
such beneficial effects are not well understood. it has
been demonstrated that consuming n-3 pufas rich in fish
oil suppressed production of cytokines (il-1, il-2, and

has also been demonstrated in human subjects and in
mice (51, 52). as both the cytokines and cox-2 belong to
a family of immediate early response genes (24), we reasoned that n-3 pufas might also suppress the expression
of cox-2 through modulation of the signaling pathways
leading to its expression. indeed, our results demonstrate
that the intake of n-3 pufas leads to suppression of lpsinduced cox-2 expression in human monocytes.
the next question was the identity of the molecular target(s) that mediates the suppression of cytokine production or cox-2 expression by n-3 pufas as compared with
n-6 pufas. to answer this question, we first examined the
molecular target(s) through which pufas modulate signaling pathways. the results shown in fig. 2 demonstrate
that all unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  inhibit lps-induced cox-2
expression. the results presented in fig. 3a–b, 5d suggest
that the molecular target for the inhibition by dha is
tlr itself or its associated molecules, but not the components of the downstream pathways. next, we compared
the efficacy of n-3 pufas in modulating the molecular tar-

gets. both lps-induced nfb activation and cox-2 expression were preferentially inhibited by n-3 pufas in
raw 264.7 cells in a similar pattern and dose range (fig.
2). this finding corroborates the results of the clinical
studies demonstrating the suppression of lps-induced
cox-2 expression in blood monocytes by high doses of
fish oil (fig. 1).
since bacterial lipopeptides also require fatty acid acylation for the activation of tlr2 (19), we investigated
whether  xxxd2154xxx  also modulate tlr2 signaling pathways. similar to the results obtained with tlr4 agonist
stimulation, unsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  inhibited but the saturated fatty acid  xxxd1921xxx  potentiated, tlr2 agonistinduced nfb activation and cox-2 expression.
together, these results represent a novel mechanism by
which n-3 pufas inhibit the expression of cox-2 that is
overexpressed in sites of inflammation and in many types
of tumor tissues (28, 53–56). furthermore, these results
suggest that the anti-inflammatory effects of dietary n-3
pufas are mediated at least in part through the inhibition of tlr-induced signaling pathways and target gene
expression. infection and inflammation are important
risks for the development of many chonic diseases (57–
59). thus, our results suggest the possibility that both the
beneficial and detrimental effects of different dietary fatty
acids on the risk of developing chonic inflammatory diseases may in part be mediated through the modulation of
toll-like receptors.
