when peripheral decarboxylation is blocked by carbidopa or benserazide, the
main metabolic pathway of levodopa is o-methylation by  xxxg487xxx  (comt).  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are new potent, selective and
reversible nitrocatechol-type comt inhibitors. animal studies have demonstrated
that  xxxd2000xxx  mainly has a peripheral effect whereas  xxxd3395xxx  also inhibits
o-methylation in the brain. in human volunteers, both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx 
dose-dependently inhibit the comt activity in erythrocytes, improve the bioavailability and decrease the elimination of levodopa, and inhibit the formation
of 3-o-methyldopa (3-omd).  xxxd2000xxx  is administered with every scheduled
dose of levodopa whereas  xxxd3395xxx  is administered 3 times daily. the different
administration regimens for these agents are based on their different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles.
both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  enhance and extend the therapeutic effect of
levodopa in patients with advanced and fluctuating parkinson’s disease. they
prolong the duration of levodopa effect. clinical studies show that they increase
the daily on time by an average 1 to 3 hours, improve the activities of daily living
and allow daily levodopa dosage to be decreased. correspondingly, they significantly reduce the daily off time. no comparative studies between  xxxd2000xxx 

1234

and  xxxd3395xxx  have been performed.  xxxd3395xxx  also appears to have a beneficial
effect in patients with nonfluctuating parkinson’s disease.
the main adverse effects of the comt inhibitors are related to their dopaminergic and gastrointestinal effects. enhancement of dopaminergic activity may
cause an initial worsening of levodopa–induced adverse effects, such as dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, sleep disorders and hallucinations.
levodopa dose adjustment is recommended to avoid these events.  xxxd3395xxx  is
associated with diarrhoea in about 16 to 18% of patients and  xxxd2000xxx  in less
than 10% of patients. diarrhoea has led to discontinuation in 5 to 6% of patients
treated with  xxxd3395xxx  and in 2.5% of those treated with  xxxd2000xxx . urine discoloration to dark yellow or orange is related to the colour of comt inhibitors
and their metabolites. elevated liver transaminase levels are reported in 1 to 3%
of patients treated with  xxxd3395xxx  but very rarely, if at all, in patients treated with
 xxxd2000xxx . the descriptions of acute, fatal fulminant hepatitis and potentially
fatal neurological reactions, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, in association with  xxxd3395xxx  led to the suspension of its marketing
authorisation in the european community and canada. in many other countries,
the use of  xxxd3395xxx  is restricted to patients who are not responding satisfactorily
to other therapies. regular monitoring of liver enzymes is required if  xxxd3395xxx 
is used. no such adverse reactions have so far been described for  xxxd2000xxx  and
no laboratory monitoring has been proposed.
comt inhibitors added to levodopa therapy are beneficial, particularly in
patients with fluctuating disease. they may be combined with other antiparkinsonian drugs, such as dopamine agonists, selegiline and anticholinergics without
adverse interactions. they provide a new treatment possibility in patients with
parkinson’s disease who have problems with their present levodopa therapy.

 xxxg487xxx  (comt) is an intracellular enzyme that is widely distributed in the
body. comt catalyses the transfer of the methyl
group of s-adenosyl- xxxd2595xxx  to one of the hydroxyl groups of a catechol substrate.[1] the physiological substrates include dopa, dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline, their hydroxylated metabolites
and catecholestrogens.[2] in addition, several medicinal substances with a catechol structure are substrates, for example, apomorphine, benserazide, carbidopa, dobutamine,  xxxd2398xxx , methyldopa and
rimiterol. the general function of comt is the
elimination of biologically active or toxic catechols
and some other hydroxylated metabolites.
the first comt inhibitors were described in
1960s.[2] several of these compounds, for example,
the gallates, u-0521 and tropolone, have been used
as in vitro tools. since they are unselective, nonpotent and quite toxic they were not particularly

suitable for clinical purposes. however, butylgallate and u-0521 were tested in a few patients with
parkinson’s disease in combination with levodopa
but the results were not very promising.[3,4]
the interest in comt inhibitors revived in
1980s when new, potent and selective inhibitors were
developed.[5-7] nearly all of them have a nitrocatechol structure. the exception is cgp-28014 which
is a pyridine derivative. two of them, namely  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  (fig. 1), have been widely studied in parkinson’s disease and are now available for
clinical use in many countries (see section 9 for details of the suspension of and restrictions for the use
of  xxxd3395xxx ). their properties will be described in
detail in this article. some clinical data are also
available on nitecapone[8,9] and cgp-28014.[10,11]
apparently they were not further developed for
parkinson’s disease or other neurological indications and therefore are not discussed here.

1. rationale for the use of
 xxxg487xxx  (comt)
inhibitors in parkinson’s disease
the main clinical application of comt inhibitors is as adjuncts in levodopa therapy, which is still
the most effective agent for treating patients with
parkinson’s disease. levodopa is extensively metabolised in the periphery (fig. 2) and therefore less
than 1% of the dose reaches the brain. the most
important metabolic pathway for levodopa is decarboxylation by  xxxg618xxx  (ddc) or laromatic amino acid decarboxylase to dopamine.
the introduction of the peripheral ddc inhibitors
benserazide and carbidopa has largely eliminated
this pathway allowing the effective dose of levodopa to be reduced by about 75%. o-methylation
to 3-o-methyldopa (3-omd) becomes the predominant metabolic pathway for eliminating levodopa when ddc is inhibited. the main formation
of 3-omd occurs in the peripheral organs, such as
liver, kidney and gut, where the highest comt
activities are found. during chronic levodopa therapy, 3-omd accumulates as its elimination halflife (t1⁄2beta) is long, about 15h, compared with about
1h for levodopa. this metabolite has no therapeutic
value. on the contrary, it has been associated with
fluctuations in levodopa treatment[12-14] and may

compete with levodopa for transport across intestinal mucosa and the blood-brain barrier.[15]
when a comt inhibitor is coadministered with
levodopa/ddc inhibitor the following potential
benefits may be anticipated:
• decreased elimination of levodopa or prolonged
levodopa t1⁄2beta
• increased area under the concentration time
curve (auc) of levodopa
• reduced formation of 3-omd
• improved delivery of levodopa to the brain
• reduced levodopa dose and administration frequency
• improved and prolonged clinical response to
levodopa
these advantages can be obtained by peripheral
comt inhibition only. central comt inhibition
might further potentiate the effect of levodopa by
inhibiting its conversion to 3-omd and the metabolism of dopamine to 3-methoxytyramine (fig. 2).
comt inhibitors could also potentiate or prolong the action of other compounds with a catechol
structure. one such drug is apomorphine, an effective dopaminergic agent with antiparkinsonian activity. it is o-methylated although it has also other
metabolic pathways.[16] animal studies indicate

that a comt inhibitor increases the bioavailability
and dopaminergic effects of apomorphine.[17,18]
however, no clinical results of the combination of
apomorphine and a comt inhibitor are so far available. another compound with a catechol structure
is the very potent dopamine  xxxg655xxx  agonist,
dihydrexidine.[19] it has antiparkinsonian efficacy
in animal studies and a comt inhibitor would possibly enhance its efficacy.
2. human pharmacokinetics of
comt inhibitors
both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are rapidly and
dose-proportionally absorbed after oral administration, with maximum plasma concentrations (cmax)

usually reached within 0.5 to 2h.[20,21] oral bioavailability of  xxxd3395xxx  (60%) is about double that
of  xxxd2000xxx  (35%). clearly higher cmax and auc
values are obtained with  xxxd3395xxx  than with  xxxd2000xxx , mainly because of the better bioavailability
and lower clearance of  xxxd3395xxx  (fig. 3; table i).
the volume of distribution at steady state is
small, 10 to 20l for both compounds.  xxxd3395xxx  is
more highly bound to plasma proteins (99.9%) than
 xxxd2000xxx  (98%). this may indicate more interactions in protein binding with  xxxd3395xxx . at therapeutic doses, the comt inhibitors are rapidly eliminated, with an apparent half-life (t1⁄2) of 1.5 to 3h
after oral administration. after intravenous administration,  xxxd2000xxx  has shorter t1⁄2beta, about 0.5h,
than  xxxd3395xxx , about 1.3h (table i).

 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are highly metabolised, mainly in the liver. most of the absorbed  xxxd2000xxx  is eliminated via the biliary route[22,24]
whereas a smaller amount of  xxxd3395xxx , about 40%
of the dose, is excreted in the faeces.[25] only 0.5%
or less of an oral dose of both compounds is excreted unchanged in the urine. the main urinary metabolite is the glucuronide of the parent compound,
representing 70% and 30% of the metabolites of
 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx , respectively.[24,26]  xxxd2000xxx  (the e-isomer of the molecule) has one active metabolite, the z-isomer, which accounts for
only 5% of the total plasma auc of both isomers.[20,24]  xxxd2000xxx  is not o-methylated in humans, whereas about 3%  xxxd3395xxx  is converted to
3-o-methyltolcapone. this metabolite has a long
t1⁄2beta of 35h,[21] which may suggest that accumulation
could occur. however, during long term administration only minor accumulation of 3-o-methyltolcapone
was detected due to the suppression of its formation
by  xxxd3395xxx  itself (by comt inhibition).[27] in contrast to  xxxd2000xxx , about 3% of  xxxd3395xxx  is oxidised by cytochrome p-450 (cyp) isoenzymes
(cyp3a4 and  xxxg582xxx ) to active alcohol and carboxyl acid metabolites.[26]  xxxd3395xxx  did not change
the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
 xxxd3394xxx , an agent metabolised by cyp2c9,
suggesting that a clinically relevant interaction between  xxxd3395xxx  and this isoenzyme is unlikely.[28]

as expected, during chronic administration at
therapeutic doses neither  xxxd2000xxx  nor  xxxd3395xxx 
accumulate in plasma.[27,29,30] the combination of
levodopa and a ddc inhibitor with  xxxd2000xxx  or
 xxxd3395xxx  does not significantly affect  xxxd2000xxx 
and  xxxd3395xxx  pharmacokinetics.[29,31] adosage reduction for  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  is recommended in patients with liver impairment because
of increased bioavailability and reduced clearance
of the comt inhibitors.[32,33] in fact,  xxxd2000xxx 
is not recommended for patients with liver impairment since there is currently only a 200mg tablet
available which cannot be halved.[34]
3. comt inhibition
nitrocatechols are so called tight-binding inhibitors of comt, although their binding to comt is
fully reversible when studied in vitro.[35-37] in addition, in vivo they reversibly and dose-dependently
inhibit the comt activity in human erythrocytes.[20,21]  xxxd3395xxx  appears to be more potent
than  xxxd2000xxx , as evaluated by both maximum
inhibition and duration of inhibition. after a single
dose of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg, the comt activity has
fully recovered within 8h whereas the corresponding time is about double after  xxxd3395xxx  administration (fig. 3b). during repeated administration of
 xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx , no tolerance develops to
their inhibitory activities.[27,29]

4. levodopa pharmacokinetics
 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  dose-dependently increase the auc of levodopa in healthy volunteers,
without significantly changing the cmax value[31,38-40]
(table ii). higher than therapeutic doses (400mg)
may retard the absorption of levodopa, as observed
in prolonged time to reach cmax (tmax).[31,38,39]
at single doses of 100 to 200mg,  xxxd3395xxx  appears to be more potent than  xxxd2000xxx  in increasing the auc of levodopa in line with its higher
plasma concentration (fig. 4a). multiple administration of  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  does not alter their
effects on levodopa pharmacokinetics.[27,29,30] the
type of ddc inhibitor (carbidopa or benserazide)
used with levodopa does not essentially affect the
pharmacokinetic effects of comt inhibitors.[40-42]
both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  are also effective in
combination with controlled release levodopa preparations.[40,42,43] in combination with a controlled release levodopa preparation,  xxxd2000xxx  appears to
slightly increase the cmax of levodopa whereas  xxxd3395xxx  increases the tmax value of levodopa.[42,43]
when studied in patients with parkinson’s disease both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  significantly
increase the auc and t1⁄2beta of levodopa. the increase in auc and t1⁄2beta after  xxxd3395xxx  200mg has
been equal or slightly greater than after  xxxd2000xxx 
200mg (table iii). however, there are no published
data on levodopa pharmacokinetics in patients with
parkinson’s disease after a single dose of  xxxd3395xxx 

100mg, which is the recommended initial dose for
 xxxd3395xxx .
after 8 weeks treatment with  xxxd3395xxx  up to
200mg 3 times daily, auc values of levodopa increase by 33%.[51] the corresponding figure after
8-weeks treatment with  xxxd2000xxx  (1200 mg/day)
was slightly better at 43%.[47] the latter study is
notable because repeated plasma samples were taken
throughout the day. this study demonstrated that
during  xxxd2000xxx  treatment, the mean daily levodopa concentration increases despite the reduction
of levodopa dose (-27%) and the daily variation in
plasma levodopa concentrations significantly decreases. this would indicate less fluctuation in clinical disability in patients with parkinson’s disease,
as was also found by nutt et al.[47] as was noted in
the study in volunteers,[43]  xxxd2000xxx  (200mg 3 or
4 times daily) for 10 days led to a significant increase in the auc of levodopa in patients with parkinson’s disease receiving either standard or controlled release levodopa formulations.[52] in this
study,  xxxd2000xxx  increased levodopa cmax in patients receiving a controlled release levodopa preparation but not in those receiving a standard levodopa preparation. no pharmacokinetic data for
levodopa are available when  xxxd3395xxx  is administered in combination with a controlled release levodopa preparation in patients with parkinson’s disease.

5. 3-o-methyldopa levels
as would be expected, the comt inhibitors reduce the formation of 3-omd both in healthy volunteers and patients with parkinson’s disease. since
3-omd has a long t1⁄2, about 15h,[53] the inhibition of
3-omd formation in patients with parkinson’s disease can only be observed after chronic treatment
with comt inhibitors. in healthy volunteers, single
doses of  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  dose-dependently
suppress the formation of 3-omd[31,38,39] (table ii,
fig. 4b). a similar inhibition of 3-omd formation
has also been observed after  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  in combination with controlled release levodopa formulations.[42,43] one to 2 months’ treatment

with  xxxd2000xxx  at recommended clinical doses
(200mg with each levodopa dose) inhibits the formation of 3-omd by 45 to 63%.[45,47,54] the corresponding figure after 2-months of  xxxd3395xxx  (200mg
3 times daily) was 79%.[51] there are no data available on changes in 3-omd pharmacokinetics after
administration of  xxxd3395xxx  100mg 3 times daily.
6. peripheral catecholamine
metabolism
since the comt enzyme is involved in the metabolism of dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline, it is possible that comt inhibitors affect peripheral catecholamine metabolism. treatment with

a single dose (up to 200mg) or repeated doses (400
or 800mg 3 times daily for 1 week) of  xxxd2000xxx 
has no effect on plasma catecholamine levels at rest
or during exercise but significantly changes the
metabolic profile of catecholamines.[55,56] after  xxxd2000xxx  administration, plasma concentrations of
the monoamine oxidase (mao)-dependent metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (dopac)
and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl glycol ( xxxd2178xxx ), increase, whereas those of the comt-dependent metabolite, 3-methyl 4-hydroxyphenylethylene glycol
(mhpg), decrease. comt inhibitors substantially
increase the plasma levels of dopac and generally
decrease the levels of hva, when studied in healthy
volunteers[38,39,43,57] (table ii).
in patients with parkinson’s disease, a single dose
of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg in combination with levodopa
and benserazide does not alter the plasma levels of
dopamine or noradrenaline but decreases those of
mhpg.[58] in contrast to  xxxd2000xxx ,  xxxd3395xxx  has
been reported to significantly elevate plasma dopamine levels.[59] treatment with  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  decreases plasma hva levels and increases
dopac levels in patients with parkinson’s disease.[46,54,58,60]
the results suggest that the free plasma levels
of catecholamines are probably not substantially
increased by comt inhibitors. this is an important safety aspect for the use of comt inhibitors.
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

the results also suggest that the combination of a
comt inhibitor with the present fixed ratio levodopa/ddc inhibitor formulations may lead to some
peripheral levodopa being converted to dopamine
and further to dopac, since the extent of ddc
inhibition may not be sufficient. it should be noted
that neither  xxxd2000xxx  nor  xxxd3395xxx  increase
plasma carbidopa concentrations despite the fact that
carbidopa is a weak substrate for comt in vitro.[34,61]
oechsner et al.[59] have suggested that the dose of
the ddc inhibitor should be increased when combined with  xxxd3395xxx  to avoid the peripheral adverse effects of dopamine. different dose ratios of
comt inhibitor, levodopa and ddc inhibitor are
worth testing to identify the optimum dose ratios.
7. positron emission tomography
(pet) studies
6-[18f]-fluorodopa (6-fd) is an analogue of levodopa. it is widely used in positron emission tomography (pet) studies as a tracer of the dopaminergic
system. like levodopa, it is decarboxylated by ddc
to [18f]-dopamine and o-methylated by comt to
3-o-methyl-[18f]-dopa (3-omfd). in routine pet
studies 3-omfd represents a considerable proportion of the radioactivity in both plasma and
brain.[62,63] various kinetic models have been used
to differentiate the specific from nonspecific activity. selective comt inhibition would reduce the
formation of 3-omfd, simplify pet modelling,
and improve the quality of pet images. in addition,
pet provides an in vivo method to test whether
peripheral comt inhibition actually increases the
availability of 6-fd (a marker of levodopa) to the
brain.
both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  when given in
combination with 6-fd and a ddc inhibitor, significantly reduce the plasma levels of 3-omfd in
monkeys.[64-68] the decreased peripheral metabolism of 6-fd after comt inhibition is reflected as
an increased striatal uptake of 6-fd and significantly
better pet image contrast.
the human pet studies with comt inhibitors
have been performed either with  xxxd2000xxx  or nitecapone, another peripherally acting comt inhibidrugs 2000 jun; 59 (6)

comt inhibitors in parkinson’s disease

tor.[69] no published data on pet studies with
 xxxd3395xxx  in humans are available.  xxxd2000xxx  has
significantly improved the ratio of the activity in
the striatum versus the occipital lobe or cerebellum
both in normal volunteers and in patients with parkinson’s disease. the improvement has varied
from 2 to 41%.[70-73] the patients with a short history of parkinson’s disease have shown better striatal uptake of 6-fd than those with advanced disease. the probable explanation is that the 6-fd
storage capacity in striatum decreases with degenerating dopaminergic neurons.
to conclude, pet studies with 6-fd demonstrate
that the peripheral comt inhibitors substantially
improve the brain entry of 6-fd. consequently, it
is likely that such an effect is also obtained in clinical practice with the combination of a levodopa/
ddc inhibitor and a comt inhibitor.
8. clinical efficacy
both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  have been effective in several non-blind and double-blind clinical
studies. because of differences in patient materials, study designs, treatment periods, medications
and statistical analyses, comparing the results
achieved with these two inhibitors is complicated.
with these reservations, some of the clinical results
are collated in tables iv and v. all studies with
 xxxd2000xxx  and most of the studies with  xxxd3395xxx 
have been conducted in patients with parkinson’s
disease who were experiencing clinical fluctuations, that is, end-of-dose deterioration (wearing
off) and dyskinesias.
the dose of  xxxd2000xxx  200mg with each levodopa and ddc inhibitor dose up to 10 times per
day has been selected for clinical use, mainly based
on the results of a dose-response study.[44] the
compatible pharmacokinetic profiles of levodopa
and  xxxd2000xxx  also favour this administration regimen. the dose-response relationship for  xxxd3395xxx 
has not been very consistent in single-dose studies.[50,60,83,84] in long term studies, the daily dosages
of  xxxd3395xxx  have varied from 50 to 400mg 3 times
daily. even in these studies, the differences between
4 dose levels have been ambiguous (see table v). at

present, the manufacturer recommends that  xxxd3395xxx  should be initiated at a dosage of 100mg 3
times daily together with the first levodopa dose,
then at 6-hourly intervals with a 12–hour night-time
break.[25] the dosage can be increased to 200mg 3
times daily but dopaminergic adverse reactions may
be a limiting factor.
both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  as single doses
with levodopa and ddc inhibitor prolong the motor response (the so-called on time) to levodopa
(table iv). the conclusion from these results is that
there are apparently no marked differences between
the two compounds.
the efficacy of  xxxd2000xxx  in patients with fluctuating parkinson’s disease has been elucidated in
2 double-blind studies of 6 months duration[76,77]
and that of  xxxd3395xxx  in several double-blind studies of 6 weeks and 3 months formal duration[78-82]
(table v). both  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  significantly increase the on time and correspondingly
decrease the off time in patients with advanced
parkinson’s disease. the net increase (placebo effect deducted) in daily on time has varied from
about 1 to 2h with  xxxd2000xxx  and from about 0 to
2.5h with  xxxd3395xxx  (table v). the clinical efficacy
of comt inhibitors is observed within a few days
after treatment initiation, as would be expected as
even a single dose of a comt inhibitor increases
the auc and t1⁄2 of levodopa. in line with their effect on levodopa pharmacokinetics, comt inhibitors permit a reduction in daily levodopa dose. the
average daily dose reduction has been about 100 to
200mg. the intensification of dyskinesias by
comt inhibitors is the most important reason for
dose reduction. in case the patient has pronounced
peak-dose dyskinesia it is advisable to reduce the
amount of single doses of levodopa. in other patients it may be more reasonable to increase the
levodopa administration interval.
after withdrawal of  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx , a
rapid worsening of parkinson’s disease symptoms
is observed and a levodopa dose adjustment upwards is needed.[61,76,77]
comt inhibitors have also had a beneficial effect on other efficacy parameters. for instance, endrugs 2000 jun; 59 (6)

tacapone has potentiated the magnitude of the levodopa effect, that is, the motor part of unified parkinson’s disease rating scale (updrs) has significantly improved,[76,77] even though the patients were
tested in on phase. a similar tendency has been
observed in long term studies with  xxxd3395xxx .[78,80-82]
 xxxd3395xxx  has clearly decreased the motor scores of
updrs when evaluated every 30 minutes for 10
hours after 42-days treatment.[79] the activities of
daily living (adl) score has also improved in most
of these studies, indicating significant subjective
benefit for patients. furthermore, investigators’
global measures of disease severity indicate that both
 xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  have positive effects on
parkinson’s disease symptoms. the patients’ selfreported global evaluations demonstrate similar positive results in long term studies with  xxxd2000xxx .
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3395xxx  has also been
investigated in patients with nonfluctuating parkinson’s disease. one of these studies included patients with parkinson’s disease whose fluctuations

were controlled by more frequent levodopa administration.[85] at 6 weeks, the  xxxd3395xxx  groups (200
and 400mg 3 times daily) had a moderately greater
levodopa dose reduction than the placebo group
(about 180mg for  xxxd3395xxx  and 110mg for placebo).
the only statistically significant clinical benefit of
 xxxd3395xxx  over placebo was observed in updrs
subscale ii (adl) with the 200mg dose. in another
study, patients with wearing off phenomena were
excluded. thus, the patients in this study represent
those with true nonfluctuating parkinson’s disease.[86] at 6 months,  xxxd3395xxx  (100 or 200mg 3
times daily) produced a significant improvement in
disability, as assessed by updrs part ii (adl) and
part iii (motor) and quality of life measures. levodopa dosages were slightly but significantly decreased in the  xxxd3395xxx  groups (by about 30 mg).
the beneficial effects of  xxxd3395xxx  were still maintained at 12 months.
one open-label study has been performed to
compare the effects of  xxxd3395xxx  and bromocriptdrugs 2000 jun; 59 (6)

1243

ine.[87]  xxxd3395xxx  200mg 3 times daily or bromocriptine titrated up to 10mg 3 times daily in combination
with levodopa was administered to 146 patients with
fluctuating parkinson’s disease for 8 weeks. the
mean levodopa dose reduction was greater in  xxxd3395xxx  group (120mg) than the bromocriptine group
(30mg). both treatments increased on time, decreased off time, and improved updrs adl and
motor scores with  xxxd3395xxx  being slightly more

effective than bromocriptine. no comparative data
between  xxxd2000xxx  and dopamine agonists are
available.
the efficacy studies with comt inhibitors
demonstrate that their beneficial effects on levodopa pharmacokinetics and metabolism are also reflected on a patient level as an improved therapeutic
effect. however, since there have been no studies

capone it is not possible to conclude whether there
are any significant differences in their clinical efficacy.
9. tolerability
the comt inhibitors have been generally well
tolerated.[34,61] the most frequent adverse events are
presented in table vi. the main adverse effects experienced by patients during  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  therapy are related to their dopaminergic
and gastrointestinal effects. the most commonly observed dopaminergic adverse event with both drugs
is dyskinesia. the comt inhibitors may either worsen pre-existent dyskinesia or cause new dyskinesias. the risk of dyskinesia is highest during the
first weeks of therapy. to reduce the severity of dyskinesia it is necessary to adjust the levodopa dosage within the first days after initiating treatment
with a comt inhibitor. in particular, a dose reduction has to be considered in patients with high daily

levodopa doses (≈600mg or more). a dose reduction of 10 to 30% is recommended.[34,88] in controlled
studies, the dose adjustment appears to have been
successful since premature termination rate due to
dyskinesia was low, being 1.7% with  xxxd2000xxx 
and 0.3 to 1.0% with  xxxd3395xxx .[34,61] the combination of a comt inhibitor (+levodopa/ddc inhibitor) with a dopamine agonist and/or selegiline increases the possibility of dyskinesia.
nausea, anorexia, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, sleep disorders and hallucinations are other
dopaminergic events, which may be potentiated by
a comt inhibitor. nausea appears to be the most
frequent adverse event with  xxxd3395xxx  in patients
with stable disease.[86] regarding psychiatric symptoms, hallucinations developed in 8 to 10% of
 xxxd3395xxx -treated and in 3% of  xxxd2000xxx -treated
patients (table vi). three elderly patients (68, 79
and 87 years of age) with severe parkinson’s disease developed acute confusion with  xxxd3395xxx  treatment which was reversed after its withdrawal.[89]

comt inhibitors in parkinson’s disease

the authors recommend that in some frail patients
with severe disease,  xxxd3395xxx  should be started with
a daily dose of 100mg only.
the most common nondopaminergic adverse
event is diarrhoea.  xxxd3395xxx  has been associated
with diarrhoea in about 16 to 18% of patients and
 xxxd2000xxx  in about 8% (table vi). it is also the
most common cause of treatment discontinuation.
five to 6% of patients receiving  xxxd3395xxx  discontinued the treatment because of diarrhoea.[61] a
considerably lower discontinuation rate of 2.5%
has been reported in patients receiving  xxxd2000xxx .[34] the incidence of diarrhoea is independent
of levodopa/ddc inhibitor therapy, since it was experienced by 24% of patients treated with  xxxd3395xxx  200mg 3 times daily plus selegiline 5mg twice
daily without levodopa for one month.[90] it usually
occurs within the first 6 to 16 weeks of the treatment. diarrhoea may be related to  xxxd3395xxx  dose
but probably not with  xxxd2000xxx  dose. diarrhoea
can be severe with  xxxd3395xxx [81] whereas it is usually milder with  xxxd2000xxx .[77] the mechanism by
which the diarrhoea is caused is currently unknown.
patients should be warned that their urine might
become coloured to dark yellow or reddish-brown
because of the presence of comt inhibitors and
their metabolites. this harmless event appears to
be more common in  xxxd2000xxx – than  xxxd3395xxx –
treated patients (table vi).
the most serious adverse event associated with
 xxxd3395xxx  treatment is liver failure. in phase iii
studies, significantly elevated liver transaminase
levels were reported in 1 to 3% of patients treated
with  xxxd3395xxx  but no cases of liver failure were
observed. however, after marketing authorisation,
acute, fatal fulminant hepatitis was reported in 3
patients from approximately 60 000 patients who
had received  xxxd3395xxx  therapy.[91,92] at least one
of the deaths occurred despite adequate liver monitoring. it seems that a few additional cases of serious liver injury during  xxxd3395xxx  therapy were reported to authorities. according to the summary of
product characteristics for  xxxd2000xxx ,[34] rare reports of clinically significant increases in liver en© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

1245

 xxxg1282xxx  levels have been reported. no cases of hepatitis or other serious liver failure have been reported with  xxxd2000xxx  treatment, however, clinical experience with this agent is still limited.
in addition to liver problems, potentially fatal
neurological adverse reactions, including neuroleptic-like malignant syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, have been described in relation to  xxxd3395xxx 
treatment. these symptoms have been associated
with withdrawal or rapid lowering of the dose of
 xxxd3395xxx  and other antiparkinsonian drugs. serum
creatine kinase activity is typically elevated and
hyperpyrexia may occur.[25,92] to avoid these adverse reactions the dosage of  xxxd3395xxx  should be
decreased gradually and concurrently the levodopa
dosage should be titrated upwards. the same administration recommendation is also relevant to
 xxxd2000xxx .
because of these serious adverse drug reactions,
the regulatory authorities in the european union
and canada decided that marketing of  xxxd3395xxx 
should be suspended. in many other countries, including the us, the use of  xxxd3395xxx  has now been
restricted to patients experiencing symptom fluctuations and who are not responding satisfactorily
to or are not appropriate candidates for other adjunctive therapies.[93] in these patients, liver function tests should be taken at baseline and regularly
every 2 weeks for the first year of therapy, then every
4 weeks for the next 6 months and every 8 weeks
thereafter.  xxxd3395xxx  therapy should not be initiated if the patient has liver disease or abnormal
liver function tests.
it is not currently considered essential to monitor liver enzymes during  xxxd2000xxx  therapy. it
should be noted, however, that  xxxd2000xxx  is contraindicated in patients with liver impairment,
since it is not possible to decrease the dose with the
currently available single tablet formulation. neither
neuroleptic-like malignant syndrome nor rhabdomyolysis have been reported in association with
 xxxd2000xxx  treatment.[34] as in case of  xxxd3395xxx ,
 xxxd2000xxx  should not been initiated if the patient
has a history of neuroleptic malignant syndrome or
nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis.

10. drug interactions
there is no pharmacological evidence for interactions between the comt inhibitors and dopamine agonists, selegiline, amantadine or anticholinergics, since these drugs and their metabolites are
not substrates for comt. in several clinical trials,
their combinations have been used without any apparent true interactions, although dopaminergic effects may be intensified. a single high dose of  xxxd2000xxx  (400 or 800mg) seems to decrease the
absorption of carbidopa in studies in healthy volunteers,[43] whereas the therapeutic dose (200mg)
does not affect carbidopa pharmacokinetics.  xxxd3395xxx  may inhibit the o-methylation of benserazide, which is a substrate of comt.[94] the elevation in benserazide plasma concentrations increases
the risk of this agent crossing into the brain. if this
should occur, then benserazide can start to inhibit
dopamine synthesis in the striatum. some evidence
of brain penetration has been found in animals but
not in humans.[95]
comt inhibitors can potentiate the effects of
catechol drugs, such as adrenaline, dopamine, noradrenaline and  xxxd2398xxx . the interaction may
be clinically significant if such a compound is administered parenterally in patients treated concurrently with a comt inhibitor.  xxxd2000xxx  has potentiated the effects of intravenously administered
 xxxd2398xxx  and adrenaline. the risk for cardiac
arrhythmias is increased.[96] if the patient uses a
comt inhibitor the recommendation is that the
dose of a catechol drug should be decreased. in cases
where it is necessary to discontinue a comt inhibitor, for example, before an elective surgery,  xxxd3395xxx  should probably be discontinued 2 days and
 xxxd2000xxx  1 day before based on their pharmacokinetic and pharmcodynamic data.
comt inhibitors do not potentiate the cardiovascular effects of endogenous catecholamines, not
even when the peripheral release has been induced
by exercise or drugs.  xxxd2000xxx  did not alter cardiovascular responses or haemodynamics in healthy
volunteers or patients with parkinson’s disease at
rest or during exercise.[46,55,56,97]  xxxd3395xxx  did not
modify the action of ephedrine, an indirectly acting

sympathomimetic drug.[98] there are no significant
interactions between  xxxd2000xxx  or  xxxd3395xxx  and
moclobemide, a reversible mao-a inhibitor, selegiline, an irreversible mao-b inhibitor, or imipramine or desipramine, catecholamine uptake inhibitors.[34,61,99-101] the administration of a comt
inhibitor concomitantly with a mao-a inhibitor
and a mao-b inhibitor (selegiline) or with a nonselective mao inhibitor may be unsafe as in this
case three elimination pathways of catecholamines
will be blocked simultaneously. the same may also
happen with the combination of a comt inhibitor
concomitantly with a mao inhibitor and a catecholamine uptake inhibitor.
although both  xxxd3395xxx , in particular, and  xxxd2000xxx  are highly protein bound, in vitro they do
not significantly displace other drugs from their binding sites at therapeutic concentrations.[34,61]
all catechol drugs can form chelates with iron. it
is well known that iron preparations significantly
reduce the absorption of levodopa because of chelation.[102] in vitro studies have shown that  xxxd2000xxx  can also chelate iron.[103] there is no definite evidence that chelation occurs also in vivo in
humans.  xxxd2000xxx  (+levodopa/ddc inhibitor)
and iron preparations should be taken at least 2 to
3 hours apart. no data concerning the ability of
 xxxd3395xxx  to chelate iron have been published.
however, chelation is possible, since  xxxd3395xxx  has
a catechol structure.
11. present status
the main clinical indication of comt inhibitors is as adjuncts to levodopa/ddc inhibitor therapy in patients with fluctuating parkinson’s disease.
 xxxd2000xxx  is currently indicated as an adjunct to
standard levodopa/ddc inhibitor in patients with
parkinson’s disease and end-of-dose motor fluctuations, who cannot be stabilised on those combinations.[34] because of serious adverse reactions, the
use of  xxxd3395xxx  is suspended in many countries.
in some other countries, such as the us, it is indicated only in patients with parkinson’s disease who
are experiencing symptom fluctuations and are not
responding satisfactorily to or are not appropriate
drugs 2000 jun; 59 (6)

comt inhibitors in parkinson’s disease

candidates for other adjunctive therapies.[93] regular monitoring of liver enzymes is required with
 xxxd3395xxx  but not with  xxxd2000xxx .  xxxd3395xxx  is
given every 6 hours 3 times daily with a 12h break
at night, whereas  xxxd2000xxx  is given with each
levodopa/ddc inhibitor dose up to 8 to 10 times
daily.
there are several ways to manage fluctuations
in advanced parkinson’s disease, including the addition of a dopamine agonist or selegiline to levodopa treatment, replacement of a standard levodopa preparation with a controlled release levodopa
preparation, or more frequent administration of
standard levodopa with lower doses. the introduction of comt inhibitors now provides an additional effective way to manage end-of-dose deterioration with levodopa therapy. a comt inhibitor
need not necessarily be used as an alternative to
these other management regimens since it can be
used in combination with other antiparkinsonian
drugs without adverse interactions. in fact, most of
the long term clinical studies with comt inhibitors have been performed in patients with parkinson’s disease who are receiving other antiparkinsonian drugs. nutt has recently reviewed the pros
and cons of these treatment alternatives in an excellent brief article.[104]
 xxxd2000xxx  has been shown to improve the quality of 6-fd pet studies and may be used also in
this indication.
12. future aspects
the potential benefit of comt inhibitors in patients with stable parkinson’s disease and also de
novo patients should be elucidated and subsequently the indication for their use may be broadened.
the efficacy and tolerability profile of comt inhibitors should also be compared with other antiparkinsonian drugs, first of all with dopamine agonists. because of the serious adverse effects seen
with  xxxd3395xxx , comparative studies between  xxxd2000xxx  and  xxxd3395xxx  may be no longer possible.
as in case of any new drug, rare adverse drug reactions can be excluded only after long term and more

extensive clinical usage and this is still the case for
comt inhibitors.
centrally acting comt inhibitors may have
cognition-enhancing and antidepressive effects.
 xxxd3395xxx  has been shown to affect several phases
of learning in a simple passive avoidance paradigm
and to have antidepressant activity in rat models.[105,106]  xxxd3395xxx  has increased s-adenosyl-lmethionine levels in brain,[107,108] which may explain its antidepressive and cognition-improving
effects. one report has described improved cognition during  xxxd3395xxx  therapy in patients with parkinson’s disease.[109] consequently, a new centrally
active comt inhibitor would be needed to further
test these interesting effects of comt inhibition in
humans.
in conclusion, comt inhibitors do not revolutionise the therapy of parkinson’s disease but they
do help, in particular, those patients with moderate
to advanced parkinson’s disease who have problems in their present levodopa therapy.
