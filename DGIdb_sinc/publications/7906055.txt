clonidine, an antihypertensive drug, binds to a2-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors. the
endogenous ligand for imidazoline receptors may be a clonidine-displacing substance, a
small molecule isolated from bovine brain. this clonidine-displacing substance was purified
and determined by mass spectroscopy to be  xxxd94xxx  (decarboxylated arginine), heretofore not detected in brain.  xxxd94xxx  binds to a2-adrenergic and imidazoline receptors and
stimulates release of catecholamines from adrenal chromaffin cells. its biosynthetic enzyme,  xxxg232xxx , is present in brain.  xxxd94xxx , locally synthesized, is an
endogenous agonist at imidazoline receptors, a noncatecholamine ligand at a2-adrenergic
receptors and may act as a neurotransmitter.

tivity for ligands, structure, and regional,
cellular, and subcellular localizations (7, 8).
the endogenous ligand of i receptors is not
known. however, the fact that cds binds
to all i receptors (3, 8) and is bioactive (9,
10) suggested that cds may fill this role,
and we sought to establish its structure.
we partially purified cds from bovine
brain using displacement of [3hlp-aminoclonidine ([3hjpac) from rat cerebral cortical membranes to track its activity (8,
11). fresh bovine brains were homogenized
in chilled water and centrifuged and the
supematant was precipitated in 70% ethanol. after condensation on a rotatory evaporator and centrifugation, the supernatant
was passed through a dowex 50 (h') column eluting with 3 n hydrochloric acid.
this step was followed by c18 reversedphase high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) eluting with acetic acid (25
mm). further purification (12) was
achieved with size-exclusion hplc with a

1984, atlas and burstein (1) partially
purified a substance from calf brain that
displaced binding of clonidine, an antihypertensive drug, to al2-adrenergic receptors
of rat brain. this clonidine-displacing substance (cds) was not a catecholamine nor
a peptide and had an estimated mass of 520
daltons. it was subsequently discovered that
cds, like clonidine, would also bind to a
nonadrenergic binding site, the imidazoline
receptor (i receptor) (2-4), which is believed to mediate the hypotensive actions
of clonidine and allied agents (5). i recep-

was eluted in a fraction that indicated that
its molecular mass was less than 300 daltons. cds tested positive with a ninhydrin spray reagent on thin-layer chromatography. at this stage, cds contained
no ultraviolet chromophore over 200 nm,
was a highly polar low molecular weight
compound containing an amine functionality, and was contained in a mixture of

compounds.
further attempts to purify cds directly
were unsuccessful, and we therefore isolated
cds in its derivatized form (13). derivatization of the enriched active fraction with
9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate (fmoccl) generated a mixture of compounds stable under most purification conditions. although binding was lost on derivatization,
it was regained after base hydrolysis to
release the free amine. sequential c18column chromatography of the derivatized
mixture, which monitored the biological
activity enrichment by release of free amine
from a subsample of each fraction, yielded a
single peak on c18 hplc that coeluted
with authentic fmoc- xxxd94xxx . subjecting the natural purified fmoc-cds derivative to electrospray mass spectroscopymass spectroscopy (msms) analysis gave
results identical to those obtained for authentic fmoc- xxxd94xxx , which confirms
that  xxxd94xxx  is the cds compound isolated (fig. 1). we quantitated the amount of
 xxxd94xxx  in weighed amounts of bovine
brain by derivatization to fmoc-ci of a
fraction (based on 200 u of cds activity).
the quantity of fmoc- xxxd94xxx  present
was determined from a standard curve generated by plotting ultraviolet intensity as a
function of fmoc- xxxd94xxx  concentration. in this way, the amount of  xxxd94xxx 
in bovine brain was found to be 1.5 to 3.0
nmol per gram of tissue (0.2 to 0.4 ,ug/g),

ing to ot2-adrenergic receptors by measuring
displacement of [3hjpac from membranes
of bovine frontal cortex (2); binding to i1
imidazoline sites was determined by competition with [3h]pac, with the use of membranes of bovine ventrolateral medulla

sites) (2); and interactions with 12 receptors
were determined by binding of [3h]idazoxan to membranes of bovine adrenal

mass of crude cds has been estimated from
gel filtration and dialysis to be approximately 500 daltons (1), the molecular mass of
 xxxd94xxx  is 130 daltons. the apparently
larger molecular weight of crude cds is
probably a result of  xxxd94xxx  that has aggregated because of its strong polarity.

ceptors (fig. 2). both curves were sigmoidal, with a hill slope close to unity. the
inhibitory constant (ic50) of cds in this
tissue (4 pum) by definition (14) represents
1 u of cds activity. at the il receptor, the
displacement curves for [3h]pac produced
by  xxxd94xxx  and cds were also both
monophasic (hill slope = 1), with ic50
values of 0.7 ptm and 0.6 u, respectively.
these values are lower than that obtained
for the a2-adrenergic binding sites, which
indicates a higher affinity at the i1 receptor
(3). the structures of  xxxd94xxx , clonidine,
and idazoxan are shown in fig. 3.
at the i2 binding sites in adrenal chromaffin cell membranes, the ic50 values for
 xxxd94xxx  and cds were 1 ,um and 0.8 u,
respectively, and the inhibition curves were
shallow, with a hill slope of 0.5 (fig. 2).
comparable shallow inhibition curves have
been reported for some drugs that displace
[3h]idazoxan to 12 sites in chromaffin cells
and other tissues (15), probably reflecting
the fact that i2 binding sites exist in interactive or interconvertible forms (15).
bovine adrenal chromaffin cells were
incubated with varying concentrations of
 xxxd94xxx , and we measured the release of
norepinephrine and epinephrine by standard procedures (10). like cds (10) (fig.
4),  xxxd94xxx  elicited a concentration-dependent release of both norepinephrine and
epinephrine with a median effective concentration of 5 gm (fig. 4). because chromaffin cells express i receptors but not
a2-adrenergic receptors (8), these results
indicate that  xxxd94xxx  is an agonist at this
receptor and is bioactive.
we investigated whether rat brain expresses  xxxg232xxx , the enzyme
synthesizing  xxxd94xxx  in bacteria, plants,
some parasites, and marine invertebrates
(16-19). homogenates of whole rat brains
were freshly prepared and separated into
soluble and membrane fractions by centrifugation at 30,000g for 30 min (20). enzyme

decarboxylase, its biosynthetic enzyme, are
present in the mammalian brain. this presence of  xxxg232xxx , the enzyme
involved in the rate-limiting step in  xxxd94xxx  biosynthesis in plants and bacteria
(16-19), suggests that the source of the
amine is local synthesis, not food or enteric
bacteria.
 xxxd94xxx  also shares properties of cds.
both agents bind to a2-adrenergic and i receptors with comparable kinetics and release
catecholamines on a dose-dependent basis
from adrenal chromaffin cells. these observations are consistent with  xxxd94xxx  being an
endogenous ligand for i receptors. it may be
possible that  xxxd94xxx , like other bioactive
amines, is a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator. consistent with this possibility are the
facts that (i) in whole brain the concentration
of  xxxd94xxx  (0.2 to 0.4 kug/g) is comparable to
that of norepinephrine (0.5 kug/g) or dopamine (0.5 jxg/g) (21); (ii) its affinity for
a2-adrenergic (4 pm) and i1 and 12 receptors
(0.7 to 1.0 pm) is in a comparable range to
that of other neurotransmitters [for example,
norepinephrine has an ic50 of 3 pm for otiand 0.8 ,um for a2-adrenergic receptors in rat
brain (22)1; and (iii) like other transmitters,
cds is unequally distributed in brain (23)
and is concentrated in synaptosomes (10, 23).
until now,  xxxd94xxx  has been considered to
be only a precursor of putrescine and thereby
of other polyamines (16). however, our findings raise the possibility that  xxxd94xxx  may be
a biologically active molecule in its own right.
in support of this are older observations that
 xxxd94xxx  can block the nicotinic cation channel in sympathetic ganglion and adrenal chromaffin cells (24), can stimulate release of
insulin and increase uptake of 45ca in pancreatic islet cells (25), and is a potent antilipolytic agent in rat adipocytes (26). whether
 xxxd94xxx  is also a precursor of polyamines in
brain remains to be established.

reversed-phase column (22.5 mm, inner diameter;
250 mm, length) (alltech), in which 2 ml of sample
was injected each time and eluted isocratically with
25 mm acetic acid. the active fractions were combined, dried, and rechromatographed on the same
column, but with 5 mm hol as the eluent. the next
was a phenyl column (10 mm, inner diameter) from
which the active fractions were eluted with 5 mm
hci. the active fractions were dried and run again
on a microsorb phenyl column (10 mm, inner diameter; 250 mm, length) (rainin). the final purification
step was by size-exclusion hplc (bio-rad sec 125

 xxxg232xxx  activity was present in rat brain (table 1). the amount of
enzyme, which was inhibited by its end
product  xxxd94xxx  (16), was increased
threefold in the membrane fraction, whereas its activity in the cytoplasmic fraction
did not differ from that of a boiled blank.
the localization to membranes was similar

in diminishing sputum viscosity. these results suggest that  xxxg979xxx  may have therapeutic
potential as a mucolytic agent in cf patients.

patients with cf accumulate thick secretions in their airways that cause progressive
pulmonary destruction (1). cf sputum is a
complex material, but a major cause of its
thick consistency is pus, derived from masses
of degenerating leukocytes (2). the ability
of bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease i
(dnase i) and, more recently, human recombinant dnase i to liquify cf sputum has
been ascribed to enzymatic degradation of
leukocyte-derived dna (3). we considered
the possibility that filamentous actin might
also contribute to the thickness of cf sputum. actin comprises 10% of total leukocyte
protein (4) and forms long protease-resistant
(5) filaments that are highly viscoelastic (6).
furthermore, dnase i is known to bind
monomeric actin and to slowly depolymerize
actin filaments (7), which suggests that some
of its reported mucolytic effect might be due
to actin disaggregation rather than to dna
hydrolysis.
we documented the presence of actin in
cf sputum (8) by three independent methods. first, we did an immunoblot analysis of
denatured cf sputum and identified a polyc. a. vasconcellos, p. g. allen, p. a. janmey, t. p.

peptide that was similar in size to actin and
that reacted with an actin-specific antibody
(fig. 1, inset) (9). second, we showed that
cf sputum eliminated the typical time delay in actin polymerization that has been
attributed to cation-induced nucleation of
monomeric actin (fig. 1) (10). nucleation
of actin polymerization is a property of the
ends of preformed actin filaments, and the
increased polymerization rate may be due to
the introduction of filaments from the sputum (10). third, we showed that phalloidin, a fungal peptide that specifically ligates
filamentous actin, bound to cf sputum.
analysis of 10 cf sputum samples revealed that the concentration of polymeric
actin (11) varied widely among samples
(ranging from 0.1 to 5 mg/ml) and did not
appear to correlate with sample viscosity
(fig. 1b). this is perhaps not surprising,
however, as the viscosity of filamentous
actin, like that of other linear polymers,
depends on the shear rate, the polymer
concentration, the orientation of the filaments, and, most importantly, the average
filament length. the viscosity of purified
filamentous actin, for example, varies with
the fifth power of the average filament
length (6). we reasoned that if filamentous
actin contributes substantially to the viscosity of cf sputum, then reducing actin filament length should markedly diminish sputum viscosity.
to investigate the effect of actin filament
length on viscosity, we added  xxxg979xxx , a
protein that rapidly severs noncovalent
bonds between monomers within a filament

the concentration of polymeric actin was estimated by adding rhodamine-labeled phalloidin

these sputum samples by an average of 62 ±

viscosity of the untreated sputum. by contrast, at a concentration of 250 nm, bovine
