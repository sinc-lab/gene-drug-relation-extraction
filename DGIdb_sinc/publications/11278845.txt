 xxxg2312xxx  ( xxxg2311xxx )1 catalyzes dna topological reactions via a dna breakage/reunion mechanism. the dna topological reactions allow the enzyme to segregate interlocked
chromosomal dna at mitosis (1–3) and to remove excess dna
supercoils generated during processes such as dna replication,
rna transcription, and chromosome condensation (4 –7). the
breakage/reunion reaction of  xxxg2311xxx , which is atp-dependent,
can be interrupted by many antitumor drugs ( xxxg2311xxx  poisons)

resulting in accumulation of a  xxxg2311xxx -dna covalent intermediate, the cleavable complex (8). accumulation of  xxxg2311xxx  cleavable
complexes causes tumor cell death (8).
the molecular mechanism(s) by which  xxxg2311xxx  poisons interfere with the breakage/reunion reaction of  xxxg2311xxx  is largely
unknown. several studies have implicated a possible role of
atp in modulating the pharmacological action of  xxxg2311xxx  poisons; uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation (e.g. dnp and
2-deoxyglucose) have been shown to enhance survival of adriamycin (doxorubicin)-treated chinese hamster cells (9). similarly, dnp, 2-deoxyglucose, and sodium cyanide, all of which
affect atp metabolism, effectively protect l1210 cells from the
cytotoxic action of  xxxd3309xxx  and  xxxd168xxx  (10). simultaneous
cotreatment with dnp or  xxxd2757xxx  has been shown to abrogate  xxxd168xxx  cytotoxicity in chinese hamster cells (11).  xxxd2068xxx 
(etoposide)-induced chromosome-type aberrations (mainly
breaks and exchanges) in cultured chinese hamster lung fibroblasts are reduced also by cotreatment with dnp (12). whether
these effects are due to a direct effect of atp on  xxxg2311xxx -mediated
dna cleavage induced by  xxxg2311xxx  poisons is not known.
studies in bacteria have demonstrated also that the atp/
adp ratio plays a critical role in modulating the supercoiling
state of chromosomal dna as well as cytotoxicity of quinolone
antibiotics (13–15). in this case, the role of atp/adp has been
shown to directly affect  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage in the
presence of quinolones (13). studies of a drug-resistant  xxxg2311xxx 
from mammalian cells have demonstrated also that atp plays
a direct role in modulating  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage
in vitro (16, 17).
in the current studies, we show that the atp-bound conformation is the target of a class of atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons
that includes many clinically useful  xxxg2311xxx -directed antitumor
drugs such as doxorubicin, mitoxantrone,  xxxd2068xxx  (etoposide),
and  xxxd168xxx . the atp-bound form of  xxxg2311xxx  has been shown to
be a circular protein clamp based on biochemical and x-ray
crystallographic studies (18 –20). using lac repressor-operator
complexes as roadblocks, we have demonstrated further that
the circular  xxxg2311xxx  protein clamp is capable of sliding on unobstructed duplex dna.

 xxxg2312xxx  ( xxxg2311xxx ) poisons interfere with the
breakage/reunion reaction of  xxxg2311xxx  resulting in dna
cleavage. in the current studies, we show that two different classes (atp-sensitive and -insensitive) of  xxxg2311xxx 
poisons can be identified based on their differential sensitivity to the atp-bound conformation of  xxxg2311xxx . first,
in the presence of 1 mm atp or the nonhydrolyzable
analog adenosine 5ⴕ-(␤,␥-imino)triphosphate,  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx 
poisons (e.g. doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone, and
4ⴕ-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide) was
30 –100-fold stimulated, whereas dna cleavage induced
by atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons (e.g. amonafide, batracylin, and  xxxd2563xxx ) was only slightly (less than 3-fold)
affected. in addition, adp was shown to strongly antagonize  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by atpsensitive but not atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons. second,
c427a mutant human  xxxg2311xxx ␣, which exhibits reduced
atpase activity, was shown to exhibit cross-resistance
to all atp-sensitive but not atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons. third, using ciprofloxacin competition assay,
 xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by atp-sensitive
but not atp-insensitive poisons was shown to be antagonized by ciprofloxacin. these results suggest that atpbound  xxxg2311xxx  may be the specific target of atp-sensitive
 xxxg2311xxx  poisons. using lac repressor-operator complexes
as roadblocks, we show that atp-bound  xxxg2311xxx  acts as a
circular clamp capable of entering dna ends and sliding
on unobstructed duplex dna.

into human  xxxg2311xxx ␣ cdna in yepwob6. the resulting plasmid is named
yhtop2␣c427a. the following four primers were used (the mutations
are marked in bold, and the restriction sites are underlined): primer a,
5⬘-acgcgtcgacgaattcgacaggttatc-3⬘ sali; primer b, 5⬘acaagaaggcctcagctgta-3⬘; primer c, 5⬘-tacagctgaggccttcttgt-3⬘; and primer d, 5⬘-gcctggtaccaaactgac-3⬘ kpni.
primers b and c contain the alanine codon instead of the wild-type
cysteine codon. primers a and d contain the recognition sites for sali
and kpni, respectively. two fragments, ac and bd, which have the
alanine codon, were generated during the first round pcr in the presence of yepwob6 dna. after denaturation and renaturation of fragments ac and bd, two cycles of a second round of pcr without any
primer were carried out to generate a small amount of the fragment
containing c427a as the template for the third round of pcr. the third
round of pcr amplified the fragment containing c427a using primers
a and d. sali and kpni were used to digest both the fragment-containing c427a and yepwob6 (partially digested with sali), and ligation
was carried out at 14 °c overnight. the mutated site was confirmed by
sequence analysis.
enzymes and nucleic acids— xxxg2311xxx  was purified to homogeneity
from calf thymus glands according to the published procedure (21).
full-length human  xxxg2311xxx ␤ cdna (htop2␤ cdna) was isolated by
reverse transcription-pcr using mrna isolated from human u937
cells and primers with sequences according to the published sequence of
hela  xxxg2311xxx ␤ (22). for overexpression, htop2␤ cdna was used to
replace the human  xxxg2311xxx ␣ cdna (htop2␣ cdna) in yepwob6 (23).
the resulting plasmid, yephtop2␤, then was used to transform protease-deficient yeast bcy123 (23). purification of both  xxxg2311xxx  isozymes
and mutant enzyme were performed following the published procedure
(23). lac repressor was a kind gift from dr. kathleen s. matthews (rice
university). yepg (24) is a derivative of yep24. py␤yom was constructed by inserting a 42-bp dna oligomer containing a 21-bp essential lac repressor binding site (25) into the noti site in pbr␤y (26).
py␤yod, which contains two lac repressor binding sites, was constructed by inserting the same 42-bp oligomer into the xbai site in
py␤yom. all plasmids were purified using the qiagen purification kit.
preparation of end-labeled dna fragments—3⬘ end-labeling of plasmid dna was performed as described previously (21). briefly, 10 ␮g of
dna was digested with a proper restriction enzyme followed by labeling
at its 3⬘ ends with the large fragment of escherichia coli dna polymerase i and [␣-32p] xxxd1148xxx . unincorporated triphosphates were removed
by two cycles of ethanol precipitation in the presence of 2.5 m ammonium acetate.
 xxxg2311xxx  cleavage assay—the  xxxg2311xxx  cleavage assay was performed as
described previously (27). the reaction mixtures (20 ␮l each) containing

40 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 1.0 mm atp, 0.5
mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm edta, 30 ␮g/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 20 ng
of 3⬘ end-labeled dna, 10 ng of  xxxg2311xxx , and various drugs were incubated at 37 °c for 30 min. the reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 ␮l of 5% sds and 150 ␮g/ml proteinase k and incubated for an
additional 60 min at 37 °c. after the addition of sucrose (5% final
concentration) and bromphenol blue (0.05 mg/ml final concentration),
dna samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel in tpe (90 mm tris
phosphate, 2 mm edta, ph 8.0) buffer. gels then were dried onto
whatman no. 3mm chromatographic paper and autoradiographed at
⫺80 °c using kodak xar-5 films.
p4 unknotting assay—knotted p4 phage dna was used to assay the
strand-passing activity of  xxxg2311xxx  (28). reactions (20 ␮l each) containing
40 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm edta, 30 ␮g/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , calf thymus  xxxg2311xxx 
(titrated prior to the experiment), and various amounts of adp and/or
atp as indicated were incubated at 37 °c for 30 min. reactions were
terminated by adding 5 ␮l of a solution containing 20%  xxxd3253xxx , 5%
sarkosyl, 50 mm edta, and 0.05 mg/ml bromphenol blue. reaction
products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel containing
tpe buffer.
atpase assay—the atpase assay was performed as described (29)
except that an 8.6-kilobase plasmid dna, pcasperhs83 (30), was used.
radioactivities were quantified by a phosphorimager (molecular dynamics, sunnyvale, ca).
results

differential atp stimulation of  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by  xxxg2311xxx  poisons—the possible effect of atp on
 xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage was studied using purified
 xxxg2311xxx  and various  xxxg2311xxx  poisons. as shown in fig. 1a, 1 mm
atp stimulated calf thymus  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage
induced by  xxxd3309xxx  by about 60-fold (fig. 1a) (atp stimulation
is estimated as the -fold of increased drug concentration in the
absence of atp for achieving the same extent of cleavage in the
presence of atp). by contrast,  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage
induced by amonafide was affected only slightly (less than
3-fold) by 1 mm atp (fig. 1b). the nonhydrolyzable atp analog,  xxxd604xxx , gave similar results as atp (data not shown).
similar results were obtained with recombinant human  xxxg2311xxx ␣
and  xxxg2311xxx ␤ (data not shown).  xxxg2311xxx  poisons that are highly
(about 30 –100-fold) stimulated by atp in the  xxxg2311xxx -mediated

dna cleavage assay include  xxxd3309xxx ,  xxxd2068xxx ,  xxxd168xxx , doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone (referred to as atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx 
poisons).  xxxg2311xxx  poisons that are affected only slightly by atp
(less than 3-fold) include amonafide, batracylin, and  xxxd2563xxx  (referred to as atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons).
adp antagonizes atp-stimulated dna cleavage activity
and atp-dependent strand-passing activity of  xxxg2311xxx —although atp strongly stimulated  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by  xxxd3309xxx , adp alone had no such effect (fig. 2).
however, in the presence of atp, adp effectively antagonized
the atp stimulatory effect on  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage
induced by  xxxd3309xxx  (fig. 2). the antagonistic effect of adp on
 xxxd3309xxx -induced dna cleavage was observed also with other
atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons (data not shown). by contrast,
atp had a minimum effect on  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage in
the presence of amonafide, an atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poison. in
this case, adp had a minimal effect on  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna
cleavage induced by amonafide in the presence of atp (fig. 2).
these results suggest that adp specifically antagonizes the
atp-stimulatory effect on  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons. we also had tested the
effect of adp on the catalytic activity of  xxxg2311xxx  using a p4
unknotting assay. as shown in fig. 3, adp also effectively
antagonized the p4 unknotting activity of  xxxg2311xxx .
c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ is cross-resistant to atp-sensitive but
not atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons—to characterize the role of
atp in the action of  xxxg2311xxx  poisons further, we generated
c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣. the cysteine 427 is located in the
atpase domain of  xxxg2311xxx ␣ (31). in the absence of atp, c427a
mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ exhibited almost identical sensitivity to both
 xxxd3309xxx  and amonafide compared with wild-type  xxxg2311xxx ␣ in a
standard dna cleavage assay (fig. 4). strikingly, in the presence of 1 mm atp, c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ was at least 10-fold
more resistant to  xxxd3309xxx  as compared with the wild-type enzyme. the resistance of c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ to  xxxd3309xxx  is
apparently caused by a reduced atp-stimulatory effect on
dna cleavage as compared with the wild-type enzyme (fig. 4).
by contrast, both mutant and wild-type  xxxg2311xxx ␣ were equally
sensitive to amonafide (fig. 4). we also tested other atpsensitive drugs such as doxorubicin,  xxxd168xxx , mitoxantrone,

and cp115,953. similar results to  xxxd3309xxx  were observed (data
not shown). these results suggest that c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣
can distinguish between atp-sensitive and -insensitive  xxxg2311xxx 
poisons, possibly because of its altered interaction with atp.
c427a mutant enzyme exhibits reduced atpase activity
and increased atp requirement for its catalytic activity—
previous studies on another multidrug-resistant mutant
 xxxg2311xxx ␣ mutant have shown that the mutant enzyme exhibits
an increased atp requirement for catalysis (16). to test
whether c427a behaves similarly, the catalytic activity of the
c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ was measured by a p4 unknotting assay
in the presence of two different concentrations of atp. as
shown in fig. 5, c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ was about 5-fold less
active than the wild-type enzyme in the presence of 1 mm atp.
however, in the presence of 50 ␮m atp, c427a was at least
25-fold less active than the wild-type enzyme. this result is
similar to the result from the experiment performed on another
mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ enzyme, r450q  xxxg2311xxx ␣, which is cross-resistant to atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons and exhibits an increased
atp requirement for enzyme catalysis (17).
the dna-stimulated atpase activity of c427a mutant
 xxxg2311xxx ␣ also was measured and shown to be much reduced
relative to the wild-type enzyme. the vmax was reduced from
60 to 11 mm min⫺1, and km was increased from 0.78 to 3.2 mm.
ciprofloxacin antagonizes  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage
induced by atp-sensitive but not atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons—ciprofloxacin is known to interact with  xxxg2311xxx  but does
not induce significant  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage (32). consequently, ciprofloxacin has been used to compete with other
 xxxg2311xxx  poisons in a standard dna cleavage assay to assess
possible overlap of interaction domains on  xxxg2311xxx  (32). based on
this kind of ciprofloxacin competition assay, it has been suggested that various  xxxg2311xxx  poisons including etoposide,
 xxxd168xxx , genistein, and the antineoplastic quinolone,
cp-115,953, share a common interaction domain with ciprofloxacin on  xxxg2311xxx  (32). to test whether atp-sensitive and -insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons may interact with different domains on
 xxxg2311xxx , we performed the ciprofloxacin competition assay (32).
as shown in fig. 6, ciprofloxacin reduced  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna
cleavage induced by  xxxd3309xxx  as evidenced by the gradual increase in band intensity of the uncleaved dna bands (see the

arrow) with increasing ciprofloxacin concentrations (see lanes
labeled 0.1 ␮m vm). by contrast, ciprofloxacin had little effect
on  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by amonafide (see
the intensity of the uncleaved dna bands in lanes labeled 1.0
␮m am). similar ciprofloxacin competition assays were performed with other  xxxg2311xxx  poisons. all atp-sensitive but not
atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons were antagonized by ciprofloxacin in this dna cleavage assay (data not shown).
atp-bound  xxxg2311xxx  is a sliding protein clamp—previous
studies have suggested that yeast  xxxg2311xxx  when bound to  xxxd604xxx  can undergo a conformational change into a circular protein clamp (19, 20), which is consistent with results from x-ray
crystallographic studies (18). to test whether calf thymus
 xxxg2311xxx  also can form a circular protein clamp in its atp-bound
form, we have designed a more stringent assay requiring the
 xxxg2311xxx  protein clamp to slide on unobstructed dna under physiological conditions. as shown in fig. 7, a linear dna (8310-bp,
32
p end-labeled) with two internally bound lac repressor molecules at their respective lac operator sites was used to demonstrate entry and sliding of  xxxd604xxx -bound  xxxg2311xxx . calf thymus  xxxg2311xxx  was reacted first with  xxxd604xxx  to form a circular
protein clamp and then incubated with the linear dna bound
by lac repressors.  xxxd3309xxx  or amonafide was used subsequently
to locate the  xxxg2311xxx  sliding clamps on dna by inducing top2mediated dna cleavage. as shown in fig. 7, in the presence of
atp,  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage sites induced by  xxxd3309xxx 
(lane 3) scattered all over the linear dna (a similar result was
obtained in the absence of atp; data not shown). however, in
the presence of  xxxd604xxx ,  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by  xxxd3309xxx  (lane 5) occurred primarily near the two ends
of the linear dna and extended up to the lac repressor binding

used in the cleavage assays with increasing concentrations of ciprofloxacin (0, 125, and 250 ␮m). the control experiment in the presence of
1% me2so (solvent control for  xxxd3309xxx  and amonafide) and increasing
concentrations of ciprofloxacin is shown in lanes labeled 1% dmso. all

sites. similar results were obtained in the absence of  xxxd3309xxx 
(compare background dna cleavage in lanes 2 and 4 with
 xxxd3309xxx -induced dna cleavage in lanes 3 and 5, respectively).
the lower part of the gel was overexposed to reveal cleavage
sites from the other end (fig. 7). the results from this experiment support the previous claim that  xxxd604xxx -bound  xxxg2311xxx  is
in the form of a circular protein clamp. in addition, this experiment has demonstrated that  xxxd604xxx -bound  xxxg2311xxx  is a protein clamp capable of entering dna ends and sliding on unobstructed duplex dna while retaining sensitivity to  xxxd3309xxx .
discussion

our results have demonstrated that different  xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage induced by various  xxxg2311xxx  poisons exhibits a
different degree of atp dependence. the differences in atp
dependence among various  xxxg2311xxx  poisons may reflect differences in their interaction with  xxxg2311xxx  and/or  xxxg2311xxx -dna complexes. based on our current results, there seems to be two
distinct classes of  xxxg2311xxx  poisons, atp-sensitive and
atp-insensitive.
these two classes of  xxxg2311xxx  poisons show quite different responses to atp stimulation in the standard dna cleavage
assay. the specific antagonistic effect of adp against atpsensitive but not -insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons has demonstrated
further the differences between these two classes of  xxxg2311xxx

tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 100 mm kcl, 10 mm mgcl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5

for 7 min; (c)  xxxd604xxx -bound  xxxg2311xxx  and repressor-bound dna were
mixed together followed by incubation at 37 °c for 7 min in the presence
of 0.5 ␮m  xxxd3309xxx . after treatment with sds (final concentration 1%)
and proteinase k (final concentration 200 ␮g/ml) for 1 h at 37 °c, the
samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel. lane 1,
dna alone; lane 2, contained lac repressor and  xxxg2311xxx ; lane 3, contained
lac repressor,  xxxg2311xxx , and  xxxd3309xxx . lanes 4 and 5 were identical to lanes
2 and 3, respectively, except that  xxxd604xxx  rather than atp was
present in each reaction. lane 6, dna size markers. to the right of the
panel, the 8310-bp dna, which is 3⬘ end-labeled with 32p (see the
asterisk), is aligned schematically with the gel to indicate the cleavage
sites relative to the lac repressor binding sites on dna. in the presence
of  xxxd604xxx ,  xxxg2311xxx  is shown as a protein doughnut that can enter linear
dna only through dna ends. drug-induced (also background) cleavage
sites mark the accessible regions of dna to the  xxxg2311xxx  sliding clamp.

poisons. the fact that adp also strongly inhibits atp-dependent catalytic activity of  xxxg2311xxx  suggests that adp may compete
with atp both in enzyme catalysis and cleavable complex
formation by the same mechanism. studies in bacteria have
established that the atp/adp ratio is a critical determinant
for the supercoiling state in cells probably because of the sensitivity of dna gyrase to the atp/adp ratio (14, 15). more
recent studies have demonstrated also that quinolone-induced
dna cleavage depends strongly on the atp/adp ratio, both in
cells and using purified gyrase (13). these results suggest that
the atp/adp ratio may be a common determinant for sensitivity/resistance to both antibiotics and antitumor drugs directed against  xxxg2311xxx . although atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons
used in this work have very disparate structures, their interaction domains with  xxxg2311xxx  have been suggested to overlap (32).
previous studies have demonstrated that a multidrug-resistant mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ is cross-resistant to all atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx 
poisons (17). this multidrug-resistant mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ was
shown to exhibit an increased requirement of atp for catalysis
and cleavage. it has been suggested that the r450q mutation
on this mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ is responsible for altered atp utilization and cross-resistance to atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons (17).
this mutation is located in a walker consensus motif (17). in
the current study, we have created another mutation c427a on
 xxxg2311xxx ␣. like the r450q mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣, c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣
also exhibits multidrug resistance to all atp-sensitive poisons.
interestingly, c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ retains the same sensitivity to atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons as compared with the
wild-type enzyme. c427a mutant  xxxg2311xxx ␣ exhibits reduced
atpase activity and an increased requirement of atp for catalysis. taken together, these results suggest that atp-sensitive and -insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons interfere with the breakage/
reunion reaction of  xxxg2311xxx  by distinct mechanisms and that
atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons may interfere specifically with a
step in  xxxg2311xxx  catalysis requiring atp utilization.
results from the ciprofloxacin competition experiment have
suggested that the atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons do not share
the same interaction domain on  xxxg2311xxx  with atp-sensitive
 xxxg2311xxx  poisons. this result suggests that atp-sensitive  xxxg2311xxx 
poisons may target  xxxg2311xxx  with a distinct conformation compared with atp-insensitive poisons.
based on our results, it seems plausible that atp-sensitive
 xxxg2311xxx  poisons may specifically target an atp-bound conformation of  xxxg2311xxx . our current studies have suggested that  xxxd604xxx -bound  xxxg2311xxx  is capable of entering duplex dna only from
its ends, consistent with the closed circular clamp conformation
of atp-bound  xxxg2311xxx  proposed previously on the basis of studies
of yeast  xxxg2311xxx  (19). our results also indicate that upon entry,
 xxxd604xxx -bound  xxxg2311xxx  can slide on unobstructed dna under
physiological conditions. previous studies on drosophila  xxxg2311xxx 
and yeast  xxxg2311xxx  have implicated linear diffusion in high salt
conditions that presumably weaken protein-dna interactions
to allow mobility of the protein circular clamp (19, 33). our
results, however, show that  xxxd604xxx -bound mammalian
 xxxg2311xxx  is able to linearly diffuse under physiological conditions.
the ability of  xxxg2311xxx  to slide on dna under physiological conditions may imply a role of limited linear diffusion, dictated by
atp binding and hydrolysis, in its strand-passing reaction.
our limited understanding of the role of atp in  xxxg2311xxx  catalysis
precludes us from any meaningful speculation on the mechanistic and/or functional implications of the sliding action of
atp-bound  xxxg2311xxx . the resistance of  xxxg2311xxx  poisons has been
studied in cells under stress conditions (e.g. hypoxia and glucose deprivation) that are associated often with solid tumors
(9 –12, 34 –38). reduced  xxxg2311xxx ␣ levels in stressed cells have
been found and suggested to be responsible in part for the

atp/adp modulation of  xxxg2312xxx -mediated dna cleavage
observed resistance (38 – 40). our results raise the possibility
that alteration in atp/adp ratios, which is known to occur in
hypoxic and nutrient-depleted cells (41), may contribute to the
overall resistance mechanisms through its modulation on
 xxxg2311xxx -mediated dna cleavage. thus, it seems plausible that
atp-insensitive  xxxg2311xxx  poisons may be useful particularly for
treating hypoxic tumors that have compromised atp/adp
ratios.
