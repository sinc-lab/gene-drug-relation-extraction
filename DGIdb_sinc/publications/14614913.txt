mains in some dispute (humphrey and goadsby, 1994).
moreover, the nature of the pivotal 5-ht receptor that mediates the anti-migraine effect is unclear (goadsby, 2000).
it is likely that triptans work by one, or a combination, of
vascular and neuronal effects.  xxxd3263xxx  effects can be explained by cranial vessel vasoconstriction (de vries et al.,
1999) at the  xxxg1109xxx  (longmore et al., 1997; nilsson et al., 1999a; van den broek et al., 2002), peripheral
trigeminal neuronal inhibition (moskowitz and cutrer,
1993) at the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor (rebeck et al., 1994), or by
inhibition of transmission in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, which may be 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  or  xxxg1112xxx  mediated
(goadsby, 2000). indeed the effect at the trigeminal nucleus may be both pre and post-synaptic (goadsby et al.,
2001). recent reports of pre-clinical (goadsby et al.,
2002a) and human (giffin et al., 2003) effects of adenosine
 xxxg81xxx  agonists that are purely neural in action lend
weight to the hypothesis for a neural site of action. the
differentiation of the nature of the  xxxd3263xxx  effect is not a
trivial problem since 5-ht1b receptors are also found on
human coronary vessels where they mediate vasoconstriction (nilsson et al., 1999b). indeed given the distribution of
5-ht receptors in the human cerebral microvascular bed
and on human astroglial cells (cohen, 1999) the issue is
very important for brain penetrant triptans.
dissecting out a role for the neuronal  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx 
receptors would be a very useful endeavour from the viewpoint of developing safer acute anti-migraine compounds.
recent clinical studies would indicate that the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor may be a good candidate. a relatively specific  xxxg1112xxx 
agonist ly334370 has been shown to be effective in acute
migraine (goldstein et al., 1999b), whereas the  xxxg1110xxx  agonist pnu142633 was not effective (cutler et al., 2000). compound selection for the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor agonist (pregenzer
et al., 1999) and dosing of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist (goldstein et al., 1999b) issues cloud the outcomes so that further
study of the role of these receptor populations in experimental
models is warranted.
the recent development of antagonists at the 5-ht1b
(selkirk et al., 1998) and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (price et al.,
1997), offers an opportunity to explore some aspects of
trigeminovascular physiology hitherto inaccessible. by
combining these antagonists, with a specific  xxxg1112xxx  agonist ly344864 (cohen and schenck, 1999), and with
alniditan, a 5-ht1b/1d agonist without  xxxg1112xxx  agonist activity (leysen et al., 1996), and using carotid blood flow to
obtain some measure of 5-ht1b effects in vivo, we set out
to determine the contributions of these 5-ht subtypes to

abstract—development of serotonin (5ht1b/1d) agonists for
the acute attack of migraine resulted in considerable interest
in their action. the superior sagittal sinus (sss) was isolated
in ␣-chloralose (60 mg/kg, i.p. and 20 mg/kg i.v.i. supplementary 2 hourly) anaesthetised cats. the sss was stimulated
electrically (100 v, 250 ␮s duration, 0.3 hz) and neurons of the
trigeminocervical complex monitored using electrophysiological methods. to test  xxxg1109xxx -mediated activity
common carotid blood flow (ccf) was monitored with a transonic flow probe placed around the vessel. naratriptan (5ht1b/1d/1f receptor agonist) and alniditan (5-ht1b/1d receptor
agonist) produced reductions in carotid blood flow of 38ⴞ5%
and 42ⴞ6%, respectively. these effects were attenuated by
the  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist sb224289 (p<0.05). ly344864
( xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist) had no effect on ccf. naratriptan
inhibited sss-evoked activity (61ⴞ7%), an effect partially inhibited by the  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist sb224289 (30ⴞ5%),
or by the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor antagonist brl-15572 (37ⴞ6%).
there remained an inhibitory effect of naratriptan after both
5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor blockade (22ⴞ5%). alniditan inhibited sss-evoked trigeminal activity (53ⴞ6%), an effect
abolished after 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor blockade.
ly344864 ( xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist) inhibited sss-evoked trigeminal activity (28ⴞ5%), an effect unaltered by either
sb224289 or brl-15572. it can be concluded that there are
inhibitory 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors in the trigeminocervical complex of the cat.  xxxg1109xxx -mediated inhibition is the most potent of the three in terms of inhibition
of trigeminovascular nociceptive traffic. © 2003 ibro. published by elsevier ltd. all rights reserved.

trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission in the anaesthetised cat.

experimental procedures
all studies reported were carried out under a project licence
issued by the uk home office under the animals (scientific
procedures) act 1986 that includes an obligation to minimize
animal use and suffering. cats weighing 3.35⫾0.37 kg
(mean⫾s.d.) were anaesthetised with ␣-chloralose (60 mg/kg,
i.p. with supplements of 20 mg/kg i.v.) after induction with 2–3%
halothane (storer et al., 1997). they were intubated and ventilated
(ugo basille) and paralysed with  xxxd2174xxx  triethiodide (6 mg/kg,
i.v.). end-expiratory co2 and fraction of inspired o2 were continuously monitored (datex, finland). polyethylene catheters were
also placed into the femoral artery for monitoring blood pressure
and into the vein for fluid and drug administration.

surgery
the carotid artery was dissected out in the neck and isolated from
the sheath and the jugular vein. the animal was then mounted in
a stereotaxic device. after completion of the craniotomy and laminectomy described below, the artery was placed in the probe and
the area covered with an excess of acoustic couplant. a circular
midline craniotomy (2 cm in diameter) and c1/c2-laminectomy
were performed for access to the superior sagittal sinus (sss) and
the recording site in the c2 spinal cord, respectively. to reduce
movement artefacts bilateral pneumothoraces were created, the
thoracic cord was suspended by a spinal process, and the c1
lateral spinal process stabilised by clamping to the stereotaxic
frame. the dura mater and falx adjacent to the sss were dissected and the dural–sinus complex suspended over bipolar platinum hook electrodes. to prevent dehydration, and for electrical
insulation against the cortex, a paraffin bath was built with a dam
of dental acrylic around the craniotomy and additionally, a small
polyethylene sheet inserted under the sss.

stimulation and recording
to activate trigeminal primary afferents, the sss was stimulated
with a grass s88 stimulator connected to a stimulus isolation unit
(100 v, 250 ␮s, 0.3 hz; siu5a) for a period of 25–50 consecutive
stimuli. tungsten-in-glass microelectrodes were lowered into the
dorsolateral spinal cord with a manual hydraulic micropositioner
(kopf, tujunga, ca, usa). electrical responses were amplified
(neurolog; total system gain 30,000 – 40,000) and low-pass filtered (neurolog; high cutoff frequency 5.5 khz). the signal from
the amplifier was passed to a signal-conditioning device and then
through an analog-to-digital converter (dt2839; data translation,
uk) in a microcomputer for simultaneous analysis online of single
unit activity by custom written programme (microsoft c).

receptive fields
cells responding to sss stimulation were characterised as receiving low threshold mechanoreceptor input if they responded to
non-noxious input, such as brush or stroke, on cutaneous receptive fields on the face or forepaws. they were characterised as
nociceptive specific if they responded to noxious mechanical stimuli, such as pinch or pricking with a needle, or wide dynamic
range, if they responded to both (hu et al., 1981). these cells
usually had increased firing in response to noxious stimuli. some
units had no clear cranial receptive field.

carotid blood flow
carotid blood flow was measured using an ultrasonic flow probe
and monitor (transonic systems, ny, usa; t206xs). the probe

consists of two ultrasonic transducers and a fixed acoustic reflector. the vessel was positioned between the transducers and
detector. by analysing the downstream and upstream transit time
and subtracting the two utilising wide-beam ultrasonic illumination,
the difference of the integrated transit times is a measure of
volume flow. the baseline flow data compare favourably with
electromagnetic flow data in the cat (goadsby et al., 1983) that
can be calibrated in absolute units (bond, 1967). in order to
determine accurately changes in craniovascular dynamics, the
physiological variables were monitored on-line. the blood pressure, heart rate, end-expiratory co2, inspiratory o2 and signals
from the carotid flow probe were passed to a signal conditioning
device and then to an analog-to-digital converter in the system
described above. signals were all continuously monitored and
displayed on the computer screen using locally written software in
c. all data were stored on disk for later analysis and plotting.

drugs
naratriptan (100 ␮g/kg; glaxowellcome) 5-ht1b/1d/1f receptor
agonist (connor et al., 1997), alniditan (100 ␮g/kg; janssen-cilag)
5-ht1b/1d receptor agonist (leysen et al., 1996), ly344864 (elililly)  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist (cohen and schenck, 1999),
sb224289 (100 ␮g/kg; smithklinebeecham)  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist (selkirk et al., 1998) and brl-15572 (100 ␮g/kg; smithklinebeecham)  xxxg1110xxx  receptor antagonist (price et al., 1997)
were generous gifts. each was administered intravenously.

experimental design and analysis
baseline carotid blood flow and electrophysiological recordings
with averages of 25–50 trigeminal responses to sss stimulation
were obtained. animals were then randomised to various regimens in which drug administration was checked for biological
effects using carotid blood flow changes first to demonstrate biologically active dosing of the 5-ht1b agonist effect, which could
then be re-checked to ensure appropriate dosing of the 5-ht1b
antagonists. reversal of the  xxxg1109xxx  effect of alniditan
with sb224289 yielded a pure  xxxg1110xxx  receptor agonist effect,
testable by brl-15572. ly344864 was observed alone and after
alniditan to dissect out the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor contribution. animals
treated with sb224289 and brl-15572 were pooled to examine
5ht1b/1d blockade.
data are presented as mean⫾s.e.m. unless otherwise indicated. data were analysed using a mann-whitney u test (siegel,
1956) and assessed at the p⬍0.05 level for significance.

results
all animals included in the analysis had arterial blood ph
and gases (pco2 and po2) within normal ranges for the
anaesthetised cat: ph 7.29⫾0.02, pco2 4.99⫾0.66 kpa,
po2 36.4⫾1.4 kpa. cardiovascular parameters, blood
pressure and heart rate, were also normal, apart from
some transient change with naratriptan and alniditan administration that did not persist. in preliminary experiments
no effect of the saline vehicle was seen on either carotid
flow changes or activity of trigeminal neurons.
characteristics of trigeminal neurons
neurons activated by sss stimulation were recorded from
the c2 caudal extension of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis
in lamina i–ii of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (kaube
et al., 1993). these cells had an average latency of firing
after sss stimulation of 14.2⫾3.4 ms (mean⫾s.d.), consistent with a␦-fibre-mediated trigeminal transmission. fir-

triptans, 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  and  xxxg1112xxx  receptors, when activated, can have inhibitory effects on trigeminal neurons

fig. 4. effect of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist (ly344869) on probability of trigeminal firing after electrical stimulation of the sss. ly344869 reduces the

with craniovascular nociceptive input. it is clear that both
agonists, naratriptan (5-ht1b/1d/1f) and alniditan (5-ht1b/1d),
were delivered in biologically active doses, since both
carotid vasoconstriction and neuronal inhibition were observed. moreover, the contribution of the  xxxg1110xxx /1f components could be dissected out by taking advantage of the
reversal of the 5-ht1b effects on the carotid artery with
sb224289, and the selectivity of alniditan for the 5-ht1b/1d
receptors over the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor. the data indicate that
a substantial part of the 5-ht receptor-mediated inhibition
of the trigeminovascular nociceptive input arises from the
combination of the 5-ht1b/1d receptors. it seems possible
that pure neuronally active  xxxg1110xxx  or  xxxg1112xxx  receptor
agonists would be effective in migraine offering greater
safety but probably at a price of smaller population effects.
although 5-ht1 antagonists, such as methiothepin and
metergoline, have been available for several years they
have lacked specificity (peroutka and mccarthy, 1989).
this has limited differentiation of the effects of triptans.
gr127935 is a potent 5-ht1b/1d/1f antagonist (clitherow
et al., 1994), although it must be employed with some
caution as it has some agonist actions at higher concentrations (pauwels and colpaert, 1995). the actions of 5-ht
(goadsby and hoskin, 1998) and naratriptan (goadsby
and knight, 1997) on inhibiting evoked trigeminovascular
nociceptive activity can be antagonised by gr127935,
which is consistent with an effect at either the 5-ht1b,
 xxxg1110xxx  or  xxxg1112xxx  receptors. not all triptans are active at the
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor in doses used clinically, whereas all are
active at the 5-ht1b/1d receptors, and all are clinically active
(goadsby et al., 2002b). both triptans that are inactive at
the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor, such as  xxxd3135xxx  (cumberbatch et
al., 1997), and those active at each of the 5-ht1b/1d/1f

receptors, such as naratriptan (cumberbatch et al., 1998;
goadsby and knight, 1997),  xxxd1976xxx  (goadsby and
hoskin, 1999) and  xxxd3562xxx  (goadsby and hoskin,
1996), can inhibit trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission. the addition of  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist activity does
not seem to convey any additional clinical benefit in terms
of efficacy. as an example,  xxxd3135xxx , which has limited
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist activity, is at least as potent an
anti-migraine treatment as is naratriptan (bomhof et al.,
1999) or  xxxd3562xxx  (pascual et al., 2000), which are both
more clearly active at the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor. is the somewhat limited effect of the  xxxg1112xxx  receptor explicable in
terms of trigeminal neuronal modulation?
a defining characteristic of triptans was their initial
development in models of cranial vasconstriction (de vries
et al., 1999; humphrey et al., 1990). anatomical studies in
human have demonstrated using polyclonal antibodies to
the 5-ht1b and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors (smith et al., 1998) that
only the 5-ht1b is located on the cranial vessels (longmore et al., 1997; nilsson et al., 1999a). we have shown
here a typical cranial vasoconstriction for both naratriptan,
as previously reported (connor et al., 1997), and alniditan
by directly measuring carotid flow in vivo. consistent with
data from the dog (de vries et al., 1998a), we show in cat
that sb224289, the  xxxg1109xxx  antagonist, but not
brl-15572, the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor antagonist, can block
vasoconstriction induced by 5-ht1b agonists, naratriptan
and alniditan. taking advantage of this in two separate
groups of animals, naratriptan and alniditan, our new data
show that  xxxg1109xxx  agonist action alone inhibits
trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission. the carotid
artery measurements provided a parallel in vivo index that
the dose of sb224289 was biologically active in each

496

animal studied, thus any reversal of the agonist effect
could be attributed to a  xxxg1109xxx  mechanism. moreover, the 5-ht1b effects seemed quantitatively greater
than either the  xxxg1110xxx  or  xxxg1112xxx  effects, although one
must be very cautious about such direct comparisons.
these observations are consistent with recent data demonstrating effects of 5-ht1b/1d agonists in the trigeminal
nucleus at sites other than the presumed pre-synaptic
modulation (goadsby et al., 2001).
the role of the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor is crucial in terms of
the evolution of next generation acute anti-migraine treatments, if 5-ht receptor agonist activity is to provide that
development. the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor is an attractive target.
the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor is not detectable immunohistochemically on cranial vessels (longmore et al., 1997; nilsson et al.,
1999a), nor have functional  xxxg1110xxx  receptors been found on
these vessels (bouchelet et al., 2000). indeed it has been
shown that the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor is located in the trigeminal
nucleus and ganglion in guinea-pig, rat and human (classey et al., 2002; rebeck et al., 1994), whilst 5-ht1b/1d/1f
receptors are all found in rat trigeminal ganglion (ma,
2001). it was thus disappointing to see the negative results
of a clinical study with a highly specific  xxxg1110xxx  receptor
agonist, pnu-142663 (cutler et al., 2000). however, pnu142633 whilst highly specific for the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor,
seemed to be much less than a full agonist at that receptor,
based on a functional assay in an expressed receptor
system (pregenzer et al., 1997, 1999). it is remarkable that
the compound did have detectable adverse events
(fleishaker et al., 1999). our data suggest that  xxxg1110xxx 
receptor agonists should inhibit trigeminovascular nociceptive neuronal traffic in the nucleus, but that this inhibition
would be less potent than either a pure  xxxg1109xxx 
agonist or the parent 5-ht1b/1d agonist. the new data are
thus consistent with the outcome of the clinical study for
what may not have been the ideal compound.
there are no functional  xxxg1112xxx  receptors on cranial
vessels (bouchelet et al., 2000; cohen and schenck,
1999; razzaque et al., 1999). this makes the  xxxg1112xxx 
receptor an attractive target for a neuronally active  xxxd2022xxx  treatment. preliminary data with ly334370 indicated that indeed it was clinically effective (goldstein et al.,
1999b). however, the treatment effect was seen at high
doses at which the receptor specificity of ly334370 at the
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor alone could not be assured. the question
is important because no cardiovascular adverse events
were observed in these studies (goldstein et al., 1999a).
our data are consistent with a previous study that reported
inhibition of trigeminal neuronal activity with the  xxxg1112xxx 
agonist ly334370 (shepheard et al., 1999). the current
study adds the observation that after 5-ht1b/1d blockade
with the combination of sb224289 and brl15572,
naratriptan retains some inhibitory effects on trigeminovascular nociceptive transmission that are likely to be  xxxg1112xxx 
effects, given its spectrum of activity (goadsby, 2000).
taken together the available data suggest that for some
patients a  xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist would have anti-migraine effects, indeed for those with cardiovascular disease who responded, such a medicine would be a sub-

stantial advance. however, to examine the true utility of the
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist approach much more specific
compounds will require testing, and we would predict large
studies may be required to detect the population differences in comparison to the triptans.
there are some limitations to our study that need
consideration. the conclusions from the analysis of the
data would be incorrect if there is another novel non-5ht1b/1d/1f receptor at which naratriptan and alniditan are
active. there are some data to suggest such a possibility
(de vries et al., 1998b), although the use of gr127935 in
that study, which has some agonist actions at higher concentrations (pauwels and colpaert, 1995), may complicate
that analysis. such a receptor would need to have both
sb224289 and brl-15572 sensitive pharmacology, and
so our conclusions could be re-considered in that light. we
have used only two triptans in this study. they were selected for their receptor agonist profiles. there is no reason
to suspect that the other triptans would have radically
different pharmacology in regard to the 5-ht1b/1d/1f receptor agonist activity, but the limitation needs acknowledgement. lastly, i.v. administration has the limitation of not
knowing the site of action. we have shown that our model
of sss stimulation, by virtue of consecutive depolarisation,
is post-junctional to the peripheral trigeminal nerve/vessel
complex (kaube et al., 1992). inhibitory actions of drugs
thus involve trigeminal nucleus transmission in this model
(hoskin et al., 1996). this is relevant to the use of i.v.
administration of the antagonists that has the advantage of
knowing the concentration of agonist or antagonist administered to the animal. it is clear from microiontophoretic
studies that triptans can act in the trigeminal nucleus
(boers et al., 2000; storer et al., 2001; storer and
goadsby, 1997). we did not use that approach in this
study, as the antagonists available need to be dosed carefully to maintain their receptor specificity (price et al., 1997;
selkirk et al., 1998). furthermore, the i.v. approach offered
the opportunity to make parallel observations of carotid
artery blood flow changes, which provided an important in
vivo marker of the antagonists’ biological effects.
in conclusion, the data demonstrate distinct, robust
and reproducible inhibition of nociceptive vascular activity
in trigeminal neurons with either of 5-ht1b,  xxxg1110xxx  or
 xxxg1112xxx  receptor agonist activity. the data suggest that the
rank order of activity is: 5-ht1b⬎ xxxg1110xxx ⬎⬎ xxxg1112xxx . the
data further suggest that purely neuronally active 5-ht1
receptor agonists without cranial vasoconstrictor effects
would be effective anti-migraine treatments, although interspecies differences in 5-ht receptor pharmacology dictate
caution in extrapolation from cat to human. unfortunately
the most effective option, the  xxxg1109xxx , could never
dissociate these effects because of the anatomical localisation of that receptor on vessels and nerves. a broader
view from the data are that purely neuronally active inhibitors of trigeminal neuronal activity are likely to provide a
new generation of completely cardiovascularly safe treatments for migraine with a sound biological rationale. this
strategy may be best pursued by agonists at non-5-ht
receptors.
