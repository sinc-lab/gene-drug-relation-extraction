receptors for atp are widely expressed in mammalian tissues and are reportedly involved in regulating a variety of
cellular functions (1). pharmacological studies with various
atp analogues have demonstrated two major groups of purinergic (p2) receptors: ionotropic receptors (p2x), associated
with ligand-gated nonselective cation channel activity, and
metabotropic receptors (p2y), associated with activation of gproteins (2–5). in nonexcitable cells, extracellular atp induces
an elevation of cytosolic [ca21] ([ca21]i) by two distinct mechanisms, either by activation of ca21 release from intracellular
ca21 stores or via activation of ca21 influx from the external
medium (5, 6). the p2y subtype is coupled via  xxxg923xxx /11 to the
activation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate-specific
phospholipase c. thus, activation of these receptors by atp
leads to an increase in [ca21]i due to increase in inositol 1,4,5trisphosphate (ip3)1 and ip3-mediated internal ca21 release.

activation of the p2x subtype has been shown to be coupled to
the activation of a nonspecific cation channel(s), resulting in
increased permeability of the plasma membrane to na1, k1,
and ca21.
p2 receptors have been found in many epithelial cells, including those from various salivary glands. four p2 receptors
have been identified in salivary gland cells: p2y1,  xxxg1646xxx  ( xxxg1646xxx ),
 xxxg1644xxx , and p2x7 ( xxxd3024xxx ) (6). in rat parotid acinar cells, it has been
reported that atp primarily activates a ca21 and na1-permeable cation channel via stimulation of  xxxd3024xxx  receptors. while
transcripts for p2y receptors have been detected in rat parotid
acinar cells, atp does not appear to strongly induce ip3 generation or internal ca21 release (6 –9). however, in rat submandibular ductal cells, evidence for both  xxxg1646xxx  and  xxxd3024xxx  receptors have been presented (6, 10 –13). interestingly, these p2purinergic receptors have distinct cellular localizations in these
cells;  xxxd3024xxx  receptors were found in the luminal membrane, while
 xxxg1646xxx  receptors were detected in basolateral membrane (10 –13).
presently, the exact mechanisms and ion channels involved in
p2 receptor-mediated regulation of salivary gland function are
poorly understood (6). the human submandibular ductal cell
line (hsg) has been widely used to study the mechanism(s) of
ca21 signaling in salivary gland cells (6, 14 –18). previous
studies with hsg cells have demonstrated that activation of
the muscarinic receptor leads to the generation of ip3, which
causes intracellular ca21 release and activation of store-operated ca21 influx (15–18). hsg cells have also been reported to
have p2 receptors (6, 14). atp, via the  xxxg1646xxx  receptor, was shown
to increase [ca21]i and ca21-activated 86rb1 efflux (14). it was
also reported that in hsg cells atp-stimulated ip3 formation
is coupled to the  xxxg1646xxx  activation, while atp-stimulated 45ca21
influx is mediated via activation of p2x receptors (19). however, the types of ion channels involved in these atp-induced
ion fluxes have not yet been identified.
this study examines the mechanisms involved in the regulation of salivary gland cell function by atp, by measuring
[ca21]i and the membrane conductance of hsg cells. the data
show that atp acts via multiple p2 purinergic receptors, including  xxxg1646xxx  ( xxxg1646xxx ) and  xxxd3024xxx  (p2x7), to activate the ca21-activated k1 channel (kca), the store-operated ca21 influx channel, and probably a ca21-permeable cation channel.
importantly, we report here that atp also activates an inwardly rectifying, ca21-independent k1 current. the inhibition of this current by sulfonylurea compounds and the presence of  xxxg1249xxx  and cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
(cftr) proteins in hsg cells, suggests for the first time that a
 xxxg1249xxx  type of epithelial  xxxg1253xxx  is present in salivary
gland epithelial cells. as has been suggested for kidney epitheatp-sensitive k1 channel; kca, ca21-activated k1 channel; kir, inward rectifier k1 current; sur, sulfonylurea receptor; tg, thapsigargin; pcr, polymerase chain reaction; rt-pcr, reverse transcriptasepcr; bz-, benzoyl-; chtx, charybdotoxin.

[ca21]i and membrane current were measured in human submandibular gland ductal (hsg) cells to determine the regulation of salivary cell function by atp.
1–10 mm atp activated internal ca21 release, outward
ca21-dependent k1 channel (kca), and inward store-operated ca21 current (isoc). the subsequent addition of
100 mm atp activated an inwardly rectifying k1 current,
without increasing [ca21]i. the k1 current was also
stimulated by atp in cells treated with thapsigargin in
a ca21-free medium and was blocked by  xxxd2215xxx 
and  xxxd3394xxx , but not by charybdotoxin. this suggests the involvement of a ca21-independent, sulfonylurea-sensitive k1 channel (katp). utp mimicked the low
[atp] effects, while benzoyl-atp activated internal
ca21 release, a ca21 influx pathway, and kca. thus, atp
acts via  xxxg1646xxx  ( xxxg1646xxx ) and  xxxd3024xxx  (p2x7) receptors to increase
[ca21]i and activate kca, but not katp. importantly, (i)
 xxxg1249xxx  and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator protein (but not  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or sur2b) and (ii)
camp-stimulated cl2 and k1 currents were detected in
hsg cells. these data demonstrate for the first time that
a  xxxg1249xxx -type  xxxg1253xxx  is present in salivary gland
duct cells that is regulated by extracellular atp and
possibly by the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator.
this reveals a potentially novel mechanism for k1 secretion in these cells.

lial cells (20, 21), the putative  xxxg1249xxx  channel in hsg cells
might also be regulated by a cftr-dependent mechanism.
these data reveal a potentially novel mechanism for the regulation of k1 secretion in salivary epithelial cells.
experimental procedures

results

atp-induced increase in [ca21]i and membrane conductance in hsg cells—atp, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to
100 mm, was added sequentially to the cell as shown in fig. 1.
an outward current was detected in 95% (43/48) of the hsg
cells tested at a holding potential of 0 mv in a whole cell patch
clamp mode. typically, the cells showed a response, i.e. an
increase in the outward current, at 1 mm atp with a few cells
responding at 0.1 or 10 mm. a second response was seen at 100
mm atp. however, a subsequent addition of 1 mm or higher
atp failed to induce any further increase in the membrane
current. the current was blocked by replacing intracellular k1
with cs1 (data not shown), strongly indicating that it was due
to an increase in k1 ion conductance. further, this pattern of
response was similar in the presence or absence of external
ca21 (fig. 1, compare a and b). however, in the presence of
external ca21, the outward current seen at 1 mm atp was more
sustained, presumably due to the involvement of a ca21 influx
component in this response. most cells showed a quick run
down of the membrane conductance with a duration of about
2–3 min at any given atp concentration. this is consistent
with a previous report showing that atp induced transient
45
ca21 influx and ip3 production (19) in hsg cells.
measurement of [ca21]i (expressed as the 340/380-nm fluorescence ratio) demonstrated that an increase in [ca21]i was
induced upon the addition of atp in 94% of hsg cells (254 of
270). most cells (84%, 212 of 254) showed a response at 1 mm
atp, with a few cells responding at 0.1 (9%, 24 of 254) or 10 mm
atp (7%, 18 of 254). importantly, while a response to lower
[atp] was detected, a higher [atp] added subsequently to the
same cell failed to evoke a second response. a typical dose
response in the presence or absence of external ca21 is shown
in fig. 1c. in the absence of external ca21, the initial peak
increase in [ca21]i was not changed, although the response was
more transient in nature. this suggests that both intracellular
ca21 release and ca21 influx account for the atp-induced
increase in [ca21]i. further, this pattern of [ca21]i increase
was not changed when na1 was removed from the external
medium (n 5 35, data not shown). however, when mg21 was
removed from the medium as shown in fig. 1d, a small increase in [ca21]i was induced with 100 mm atp in a ca21containing medium. these data suggest that, at 100 mm, atp
induces a ca21 influx component that is inhibited by external
mg21. this is also consistent with studies in pancreatic duct
cells (23) and other salivary gland cells (6), showing that removal of external mg21 increased the atp-induced peak
[ca21]i. however, since the k1 current measurements (shown
in fig. 1, a and b) were made in the presence of external mg21,
the k1 current induced at 100 mm atp is probably not associated with ca21 influx.
utp, a potent agonist of several p2y receptors, stimulates
ip3 generation and release of ca21 from intracellular ca21
stores (1– 4). unlike with atp, sequential additions of increasing [utp] induced an increase in [ca21]i and outward current

cell culture—hsg cells were a kind gift from dr. mitsunabo sato
(tokushima university, japan). the conditions for cell culture were
similar to those described previously (16, 17). briefly, cells were grown
in eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal
calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml
streptomycin (all from biofluids, rockville, md) under 5% co2 at 37 °c.
cells were passaged when confluent by detaching from the tissue culture dish with 0.25% trypsin, 1.0 mm edta (biofluids). a single-cell
suspension was reseeded onto coverslips and used after about 24 h.
patch clamp measurements—patch clamp in a whole cell configuration was performed on single hsg cells attached to coverslips using the
standard patch-clamp technique described previously (16, 17). the resistance of the pipette was about 3– 6 megaohms. the chamber was
connected with an ag-agcl pellet through a 150 mm nacl-containing
agar bridge. membrane currents were measured with an axopatch
200a amplifier in conjunction with pclamp 6.1 software and a digidata
1200 a/d converter (axon instruments, foster city, ca). the currents
were filtered at 2 khz (low pass bessel filter) and sampled with an
interval of 10 ms. in the step protocol, the cell was held at 0 mv for 312
ms and stepped from 2120 to 280 mv in 20-mv steps for 200 ms each
step. the leakage subtraction function was used to minimize the leak
currents. the currents were digitized and recorded directly onto the
hard drive of a dell pentium computer. the i-v relationship was calculated using the peak amplitude of the current during the step protocol
and exported to origin 5 (microcal software, inc., northampton, ma)
for further analysis.
a piece of coverslip (0.5 3 0.5 mm) with cells was placed in the
perfusion chamber (warner instrument corporation, hamden, connecticut). for measuring kca, the standard extracellular solution contained 145 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, 10 mm
glucose, 0.2 mm egta, and 10 mm hepes, ph 7.4. the pipette was
filled with 150 mm kcl, 2 mm mgcl2, 1 mm atp, 10 mm hepes, ph 7.2.
for measuring isoc, the extracellular solution contained 135 mm sodium
glutamate, 1 mm mgcl2, 10 mm cacl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm
hepes, ph 7.4 (naoh). the pipette was filled with 135 mm nmdgglutamate, 10 mm cscl, 10 mm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethanen,n,n9,n9-tetraacetic acid, 1 mm mgcl2, 1 mm atp, 10 mm hepes, ph
7.2 (csoh). any changes in the composition of the pipette and external
solutions are given under “results.” atp, atp analogs, thapsigargin
(tg), or cch was included in the perfusion medium.
[ca21]i measurements—fluorescence was measured in fura2-loaded
single hsg cells at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm, with
emission at 510 nm, using a slm 8000/dmx 100 spectrofluorimeter
attached to an inverted nikon diaphot inverted microscope with a
fluor 403 oil immersion objective. images were acquired using an
enhanced ccd camera (ccd-72, mti) and the image-1 software (universal imaging corporation, pa). the 340/380-nm ratio of fura2 fluorescence has been used to represent [ca21]i. other details of the experiments
are given in the text and figure legends. all experiments were performed
at room temperature.
western blotting—preparation of crude and plasma membrane fractions, sds-page, and western blotting were performed as described
previously (22). reactivity of the samples against either a polyclonal
anti-human cftr antibody, 1:150 dilution (a generous gift from dr. w.
guggino, johns hopkins university, baltimore, md) or polyclonal antiromk antibody, 1:200 dilution (alomone laboratories, jerusalem, israel) was determined using a secondary antibody 1:5000 dilution and
ecl reagent (amersham life sciences). plasma membrane fraction
from hek-293 cells overexpressing the cftr protein was kindly provided by dr. nelson arispe (department of cell biology, uniformed
services university of health sciences, bethesda, md). control
 xxxg1249xxx  protein was supplied by alomone laboratories. amido black b
was used to stain the proteins after transfer to the polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane.
rna isolation, cdna synthesis, and rt-pcr—mrna was isolated
from hsg cells using trizol reagent (life technologies, inc.) and the
oligotex mrna kit (qiagen). the rna was treated with dnase i
(amplification grade, life technologies, inc.) at a concentration of 1
unit/mg of rna. human pancreatic mrna was purchased from clontech. first strand cdna synthesis of  xxxg1249xxx ,  xxxg19xxx , sur2a, and
sur2b was carried out using 0.5 mg of mrna using antisense-specific

primers as follows:  xxxg1249xxx  (59-ggagctttagagactttgctttac),
 xxxg19xxx  (59-ctcaaggatggcaccccgcttcagg), sur2a (59-ctgagggtattttagtggagtgtg), and sur2b (59- cacactattctgacggcagacctgg). the sense primers used for rt-pcr were as follows:
 xxxg1249xxx  (59-cagggtgttgacagaaagtatgttc),  xxxg19xxx  (59-gccctggccgtcatctcctatgtc), and sur2a and -2b (59-ccaaccttggaatctctaactcgc). rt-pcr was performed using superscript reverse transcriptase ii (life technologies, inc.). the pcr mixture
contained 20 mm tris-hcl (ph 8.5), 50 mm kcl, 1.5 mm mgcl2, a 0.2 mm
concentration of each dntp, 20 pmol of each primer, first strand cdna,
and 2.5 units of taq dna polymerase. pcr was performed as follows
for 35 cycles: 94 °c denaturation for 30 s, 55 °c annealing for 45 s, and
68 °c extension for 2 min. 10% of the sulfonylurea receptor (sur)
products and 5% of the  xxxg1249xxx  product were loaded on a 1% agarose gel.

fig. 1. atp-stimulated outward
current and [ca21]i increase in hsg
cells. currents were recorded in hsg
cells by using a patch clamp, in a whole
cell configuration, at 0 mv holding potential in the presence (a) or absence (b) of
external ca21. external medium, with increasing [atp], was perfused into the
chamber for the periods indicated by the
corresponding bar. the traces shown are
representative of data obtained in 14
cells. [ca21]i was monitored in single
hsg cells maintained ca21-free or ca21containing (c) or mg21-free (d) medium.
various [atp] was added to the medium
as shown by the corresponding arrows.
these traces are the representative results from at least 40 cells in each
experiment.

only at 1 mm (fig. 2, a and b). this pattern was not changed in
the absence of external mg21 or with 10 mm external mg21 (n 5
43, data not shown). however, prior stimulation of cells with
utp attenuated the [ca21]i increase induced by a subsequent
addition of atp to the same cell, and vice versa (see fig. 2, c
and d). as seen with utp, only low [2mes-atp] induced a
response. however, the response was lower than that induced
by atp or utp (data not shown).
we have recently reported that depletion of intracellular
ca21 stores in hsg cells by muscarinic receptor stimulation
with cch, introduction of ip3 into the cell, or treatment with
the ca21 pump inhibitor tg, activated isoc, which was dependent on external [ca21] and inhibited by la31 and gd31 (17).

the data in fig. 3 show that atp (1 mm) also induced an inward
ca21 current in hsg cells. this inward current was dependent
on external [ca21] and was eliminated by changing the external [ca21] from 10 to 0 mm (fig. 3a). atp-induced isoc had a
larger amplitude (25 6 7 pa), but a shorter duration (3– 4 min),
compared with that induced by ip3 or cch (17) and was inhibited by la31 (fig. 3b). notably, atp (1 mm)-induced inward
ca21 and outward k1 currents displayed similar characteristics i.e. dependence on external ca21 and inhibition by la31
(fig. 3, compare a and b with c and d). further, stimulation of
cells with atp in a ca21-free medium inhibited the response to
a subsequent addition of cch (data not shown). this is the first
report of atp-induced isoc in a salivary cell. taken together,

fig. 3. inhibition of atp-activated
isoc and outward k1 current by la31
in hsg cells. store-operated inward current (isoc, a and b) stimulated by 10 mm
atp (perfused during the entire experiment) was measured by whole cell configuration at 0 mv holding potential as described under “experimental procedures.”
a, [ca21] in the external medium was
changed from 10 to 0 mm, shown by the
corresponding bar. b, cells were exposed
to external medium containing 10 mm
ca21 and 1 mm la31, shown by the corresponding bar. these are the representative traces from five (a) or four (b) cells,
respectively. k1 currents (c and d) were
measured as described for fig. 1 in the
presence of 10 mm atp in the perfusion
medium. c, [ca21] in the perfusion medium was changed to 0 ca21 for the period
shown by the corresponding bar; d, 1 mm
lacl3 was included in the external solution where indicated.

these data demonstrate that in hsg cells low [atp] (,10 mm)
stimulates  xxxg1646xxx  ( xxxg1646xxx ) receptors to cause the release of ca21
from internal ca21 stores, which results in the activation of
kca and isoc.
atp-induced ca21-independent k1 current—fig. 1 shows
that high [atp] activates a k1 current in hsg cells that is not
accompanied by any changes [ca21]i. to determine the nature
of this k1 current, we examined the effect of depletion of the
intracellular ca21 store with tg. [ca21]i was monitored in the
absence of external ca21, and data are shown in fig. 4a. tg
induced an increase in [ca21]i due to ca21 “leakage” from the
internal stores. the subsequent addition of atp (10 –100 mm) to
the cells failed to induce any further increase in [ca21]i (fig.
4a). this suggests that the [ca21]i increase induced by atp is
due to ca21 release from tg-sensitive stores. similarly tginduced increases in [ca21]i or the kca current were diminished or greatly reduced after the cell was first exposed to atp
(n 5 56 or n 5 4 for [ca21]i and the kca currents, respectively;
data not shown). in contrast to [ca21]i increases shown in fig.
4a, 100 mm atp induced an increase in the outward current in
tg-treated cells (fig. 4b). when external ca21 was reintroduced, a further increase in the outward current was seen,
probably due to the activation of kca as a result of ca21 entry.
these results clearly indicate that two kinds of outward k1
currents are stimulated by atp in hsg cells. one is associated
with [ca21]i increase, and the other appears to be independent
of [ca21]i increase. consistent with the [ca21]i measurements
shown in fig. 4a, tg induced a transient activation of the k1
current. in aggregate, the data presented above indicate that in

hsg cells atp (100 mm) activates a k1 current that is not (i)
due to activation of kca or (ii) accompanied by increases in
[ca21]i.
to further characterize the apparent ca21-independent k1
current, the effect of charybdotoxin (chtx) was examined. we
reported earlier that chtx, a large conductance ca21-dependent k1 channel antagonist, inhibits the carbachol-stimulated
kca current in hsg cells (16). as seen in fig. 5a, 25 nm chtx
also effectively blocked the k1 current induced by 1 and 10 mm
atp but not that induced by 100 mm atp (fig. 5a). the i-v
curve of the outward current induced by 100 mm atp in chtxtreated cells shows a weak inward rectification with a reversal
potential of 275 mv, which is close to the k1 reversal potential
(fig. 5b). furthermore, replacing intracellular k1 ion with cs1
eliminated atp-induced outward currents at all concentrations tested (from 1 mm to 1 mm, n 5 5, data not shown). these
data suggest that high [atp] activates an inwardly rectifying,
ca21-independent, k1 current in hsg cells.
bz-atp-induced ca21 influx and k1 currents—in addition
to the  xxxg1646xxx  receptor, a  xxxd3024xxx  subtype of p2 receptor (p2x7) has also
been found in the salivary gland cells (6). to determine
whether the ca21-independent chtx-insensitive k1 channel
was stimulated by the activation of a  xxxd3024xxx  receptor, we examined the effects of bz-atp, a potent agonist of the  xxxd3024xxx  receptor,
on [ca21]i and whole cell current. the data are shown in fig. 6.
fig. 6, a and b, shows whole cell currents following the sequential additions of 1, 10, 100, and 1000 mm bz-atp to hsg cells in
ca21-containing and ca21-free medium, respectively. in the
presence of external ca21 (fig. 6a), bz-atp activated a k1

fig. 5. effect of charybdotoxin on
the atp-stimulated ca21-independent outward current. a, 25 nm chtx
was introduced to the bath when the cell
was stimulated by atp (1 mm to 1 mm), as
shown by the corresponding bar. this is
representative of results obtained in five
cells. b, i-v curve of the outward current
induced by atp in the presence of 25 nm
chtx (n 5 5). the current induced by 100
mm atp was measured by a step protocol
in whole cell configuration. the cell was
held at 0 mv, and the membrane potential was stepped from 2140 to 80 mv in
20-mv steps with a duration of 500 ms.

current at all concentrations tested, with the largest response,
a somewhat sustained increase, obtained at 100 mm. no significant response was seen at 1 mm bz-atp. when cells were
stimulated in the absence of external ca21 (fig. 6b), the response at 1 mm bz-atp was relatively more transient, while
that  xxxd1891xxx  mm was greatly attenuated, and that at 100 mm was
barely detectable. thus, bz-atp, at higher concentrations, appeared to stimulate k1 currents only in the presence of external ca21. similar effects of bz-atp were seen on [ca21]i (fig.
6, c and d).  xxxd3024xxx -associated cation channels in salivary gland
cells are reportedly permeable to external na1 and inhibited by
external mg21 (6). however, the bz-atp-induced [ca21]i increase did not appear to be affected by replacing na1 in the
external medium with nmdg (fig. 7a). further, as shown in
fig. 7b, external mg21 attenuated the [ca21]i increases induced at all concentrations of bz-atp but especially that at 100
mm. in the presence of 3 mm external [mg21], attenuated
[ca21]i increases were observed in 35% of cells tested (23 of 65),
while [ca21]i increase was not detected in 65% of the cells.
furthermore, 10 mm mg21 totally eliminated bz-atp (1 mm to
1 mm) induced responses (data not shown, n 5 35). in aggregate, these data demonstrate the presence of a  xxxd3024xxx  (p2x7)
receptor in hsg cells, which can be activated by bz-atp to
stimulate ca21 influx, via an as yet unidentified ion channel.
low bz-atp also stimulates internal ca21 release, probably
via ip3 generation or by an as yet unidentified mechanism (6,
19). the resulting increase in [ca21]i activates kca. however,

the data are not consistent with the involvement of the  xxxd3024xxx 
receptor in the activation of the chtx-insensitive, ca21-independent, inwardly rectifying k1 channel by high [atp].
effects of sulfonylurea compounds on the atp-induced
ca21-independent k1 current—to further characterize the
chtx-insensitive k1 current activated by higher [atp], we
examined the effects of the sulfonylurea compounds, which
have been reported to block a family of inwardly rectifying k1
channels, kir (20, 21, 25). fig. 8 shows that  xxxd2215xxx  (10
mm) and  xxxd3394xxx  (1 mm) inhibited the outward current
induced by 100 mm atp. importantly, the k1 current stimulated by 1 mm atp was not significantly affected by these
compounds. further, when atp was substituted by bz-atp,
2mes-atp, utp, or adp no currents were detected in charybdotoxin-treated hsg cells (data not shown).
these data suggest that the atp-activated chtx-insensitive
k1 current might belong to the katp family of kir channels.
however, since the pipette solution in these experiments contained 1 mm atp, the  xxxg1253xxx  in hsg cells appears to
have a lower sensitivity for inhibition by intracellular atp.
consistent with this, increasing internal [atp] to 5 or 10 mm
(in the presence of 1 mm mg21) significantly reduced the k1
current (data not shown).
presence of cftr and  xxxg1249xxx  proteins in hsg cells—it has
been suggested that the sulfonylurea sensitivity of katp channels might be conferred via interaction with sulfonylurea-binding proteins such as sur or cftr protein (20, 21, 25). the

association of the classical  xxxg1253xxx  (kir 6.2) in pancreatic
b cells with sur has been well established. this k1 channel
demonstrates high sensitivity for intracellular atp and  xxxd2215xxx  (25). in contrast, the  xxxg1249xxx  family of weakly inwardly rectifying epithelial k1 channels have been reported to
have a lower sensitivity for inhibition by intracellular atp.
these k1 channels also have a relatively lower sensitivity to
 xxxd2215xxx  (20, 21). the katp channels in kidney epithelial
cells (kir 1.1a and 1.1b,  xxxg1249xxx  and romk2, respectively)
have been suggested to be regulated via interaction with the
cftr protein, although presently there are no data that conclusively demonstrate this molecular interaction. the presence
of the cftr protein was previously demonstrated, both functionally and by immunofluorescence, in the luminal membrane
of salivary gland ductal cells (26 –28). thus, we examined the
presence of cftr in hsg cells, a human submandibular gland
ductal cell line, by western blotting using an anti-human
cftr antibody. a strong reactivity was detected in the plasma
membrane fraction of hsg cells (fig. 9a, lane 2) associated
with a protein of with an approximate molecular mass of 180
kda, which co-migrated with the control cftr protein (see
lane 1, plasma membrane preparation of hek cells infected
with an adenovirus encoding the cftr). additionally, consistent with the reported intracellular localization of the cftr
protein (29, 30), more reactivity was detected in a crude membrane fraction (lane 3), which probably also includes intracellular organelles. these data suggest that hsg cells, similar to
rat submandibular gland ductal cells and kidney cells, have the
cftr protein.
further, an antibody against the  xxxg1249xxx  protein was used to
examine the presence of this protein in hsg cells. the data are
shown in fig. 9b. three prominent bands were detected in the
plasma membrane fraction of hsg cells with estimated molecular masses of about 49, 47, and 42 kda. we have not yet
identified the higher molecular weight proteins that react with
the antibody, which supposedly recognizes all isoforms of

 xxxg1249xxx . however, the 42-kda band comigrated with the control
 xxxg1249xxx  protein (lane 3, ecl reaction; lane 4, amido black
staining of the region of the blot shown in lane 3). importantly,
this protein was enriched in the plasma membrane fraction
(lane 2) compared with the crude membrane fraction (lane 1).
these data demonstrate for the first time the presence of the
 xxxg1249xxx  protein in salivary gland cells.
to confirm the presence of  xxxg1249xxx  in hsg cells, rt-pcr was
performed using  xxxg1249xxx -specific primers and hsg cell mrna
(fig. 9c; see “experimental procedures” for details). a ;1.2kilobase rt-pcr product was strongly detected (lane 1). further, when rt-pcr was performed using  xxxg19xxx -, sur2a-, or
sur2b-specific primers, sur-homologous sequences were not
detected in hsg cell mrna (lanes 2, 4, and 6). however, as
reported earlier (31),  xxxg19xxx  (lane 3) and sur2b (lane 7), but
not sur2a (lane 5), were detected in control human pancreatic
mrna.
one of the suggested criteria for the possible functional association between the cftr and  xxxg1249xxx  proteins in a cell has
been the demonstration that camp can stimulate both cl2 and
k1 currents in the cells. the data in fig. 10 show that hsg
cells fulfill this criterion. inclusion of 10 mm camp in the
pipette solution stimulated a small inward cl2 current (250 6
34 pa, n 5 5, at 260 mv holding potential with 150 mm
nmdgcl in the external and internal solutions). the current
developed slowly, remained stable for a short time, and decreased to a lower level. it was blocked by  xxxd2215xxx  (data
not shown). these data provide evidence for the presence of a
functional cftr protein in hsg cells. fig. 10b shows the
activation of outward k1 current by 10 mm camp. the outward
current was of smaller magnitude, and relatively more sustained, than that seen with atp. the current also showed a
decreased sensitivity toward  xxxd2215xxx  (data not shown),
as has been previously reported for the  xxxg1249xxx  channels in
kidney cells (20).

 xxxg1249xxx  and cftr in salivary gland cells

discussion

the data presented above demonstrate that atp activates
multiple p2 receptors to increase [ca21]i and activate distinct
cation channels in hsg cells. importantly, the data provide
evidence that external atp activates a novel glibenclamidesensitive, ca21-independent, inwardly rectifying k1 current
that is mediated by a  xxxg1253xxx . further, we have shown
that a  xxxg1249xxx -like channel and cftr, but not sur, are present
in hsg cells. thus, we suggest that this  xxxg1253xxx  belongs
to the  xxxg1249xxx  subfamily of katp channels, which might be
regulated via an interaction with the cftr. these data reveal
a potentially new mechanism for k1 secretion in salivary epithelial cells.
p2y1,  xxxg1646xxx  ( xxxg1646xxx ),  xxxg1644xxx , and p2x7 ( xxxd3024xxx ) receptors are expressed in salivary glands (6). we have shown here that low
[atp] and [utp] are equally potent in activating internal ca21
release. further, the response to low [atp] was greater than
the response to low [2mes-atp] (data not shown). these data
suggest the presence of a  xxxg1646xxx  receptor in hsg cells and are

fig. 10. camp-stimulated cl2 and outward k1 currents in
hsg cells. a, cl2 currents were recorded at a holding potential of 260
mv with 10 mm camp in the pipette solution. 145 mm nacl and 5 mm
kcl in the external medium and 150 mm kcl in the pipette solution
were replaced with 150 mm nmdgcl. b, k1 currents were recorded as
described for fig. 1, except that the pipette solution contained 10 mm
camp.

consistent with previous studies showing that in hsg cells the
 xxxg1646xxx  receptor has a nucleotide selectivity in the order atp 5
utp . adp (14). additionally,  xxxg1646xxx -stimulated depletion of the
internal ca21 store resulted in the activation of the storeoperated ca21 influx current (isoc) that was inhibited by la31
and gd31, but not by zn21. thus, isoc activated by atp has
similar characteristics as that activated by cch or tg (fig. 3–5;
also see ref. 17). low (0.1–10 mm) atp also activated an outward k1 current with characteristics similar to those previously reported for kca in hsg cells (15, 16): (i) inhibition by
charybdotoxin, but not by apamin, and (ii) dependence on
[ca21]i. notably, this is the first report describing atp-dependent activation of kca and isoc in human submandibular gland
cells. the present data demonstrate that  xxxd3024xxx  receptors are also
present in hsg cells. bz-atp, a potent  xxxd3024xxx  receptor agonist,
induced responses that were distinct from that induced by
either utp or atp. increasing concentrations of bz-atp produced dose-dependent increases in both [ca21]i and the k1
current. at lower concentrations, bz-atp induced increase in
[ca21]i and kca in the absence of external ca21. as has been
suggested earlier, this could be due to (i) release of ca21 from
intracellular stores by na1 that might enter the cells when
ca21 is removed from the external medium or (ii) stimulation
of ip3 generation (6). however, the effects at higher bz-atp
were acutely dependent on the presence of external ca21 and
were more sensitive to high external mg21. these data suggest
that higher [bz-atp] induces a ca21 influx component that is
apparently not associated with internal ca21 store depletion

 xxxg1249xxx  and cftr in salivary gland cells
ated cl2 current and the inwardly rectifying, glibenclamidesensitive, k1 current, and camp plus atp decreased the sensitivity of the k1 channel for  xxxd2215xxx  (20).
the present data demonstrate that hsg cells have (i) a
ca21-independent, sulfonylurea-sensitive, inwardly rectifying
k1 channel (katp) activity, (ii) the  xxxg1249xxx  channel and cftr,
and (iii) camp-stimulated cl2 and k1 currents. thus, the katp
activity detected in hsg cells fulfills the criteria associated
with the  xxxg1249xxx  family of katp channels. based on measurements of electrolytes in saliva and 86rb1 flux studies, it has
been suggested that salivary gland ducts mediate k1 secretion
into the lumen (36). thus, the currently accepted model for ion
fluxes in the salivary gland ductal cell depicts a pathway for k1
efflux via the apical membrane. however, presently there are
no data to demonstrate the identity or function of this k1
conductance. based on the data discussed above, we suggest
that the  xxxg1249xxx -type  xxxg1253xxx  detected in hsg cells might
be a likely candidate for this k1 secretory function. further, as
has been proposed for the regulation of the  xxxg1249xxx  channels in
kidney cells, the present data suggest that the  xxxg1249xxx  channel
in hsg cells might also be regulated via interaction(s) with the
cftr protein. importantly, we have clearly demonstrated that
cftr, but not sur, is present in hsg cells. thus, hsg cells
provide an excellent experimental system for further studies to
examine the putative mechanism by which cftr regulates the
 xxxg1249xxx  channel. notably, the cftr protein has also been
shown to be present in the luminal membrane of rat submandibular gland ductal cells (27, 28), and studies reported by
muallem and co-workers have demonstrated camp-dependent
activation of cftr-associated cl2 current (i.e. ca21-independent,  xxxd2215xxx -sensitive) in rat submandibular gland ductal cells (7). however, the exact physiological role of cftr in
the ductal luminal membrane of salivary epithelial cells is still
unclear.
in summary, atp triggers two distinct ca21 signaling pathways in hsg cells through the  xxxg1646xxx  and  xxxd3024xxx  receptors, respectively. the ca21 signaling pathway linked to the  xxxg1646xxx  receptor,
is independent of external na1 and mg21 and is associated
with activation of kca and soc. in contrast, the ca21 signaling
pathway via the  xxxd3024xxx  receptor does not appear to be activated by
atp under normal conditions (i.e. with 1 mm external mg21).
however, it is associated with ca21 influx, probably via an as
yet unidentified ca21-permeable cation channel, and activation of kca when cells are exposed either to an agonist stronger
than atp or to atp in low external [mg21]. importantly, we
have shown here that atp also activates a novel, ca21-independent, weakly inwardly rectifying k1 channel in hsg cells,
which is blocked by sulfonylurea compounds but not by charybdotoxin. together with our demonstration of the presence of
cftr, a  xxxg1249xxx  channel, and the activation of both cl2 and k1
currents in hsg cells by camp, the present data strongly
suggest that this k1 channel belongs to the  xxxg1249xxx  family of
katp channels. this putative salivary  xxxg1249xxx  channel provides
a potentially novel mechanism for the regulation of k1 secretion in salivary epithelial cells.

(fig. 5, compare a and b with c and d). 2mes-atp did not
induce a similar ca21 influx response, even at higher concentrations, while 100 mm atp induced a small increase in ca21
influx, in the absence of external mg21. in aggregate, these
data are consistent with the presence of a  xxxd3024xxx  receptor in hsg
cells. however, it is unlikely that atp induces any significant
effects via this receptor in a normal mg21-containing medium.
the important, and novel, finding of this study was that high
[atp] (.10 mm) induced an outward current that was not
accompanied by an increase in [ca21]i. we have shown that the
current was detected in cells previously stimulated with low
[atp] (fig. 1), tg (fig. 4), or cch (not shown) and was not
affected by the removal of ca21 from the external medium (fig.
1) or treatment of cells with charybdotoxin. furthermore, the
current measured in the presence of high [atp] and charybdotoxin (i) displayed a weak inward rectification with a reversal
potential of 275 mv, a value close to the k1 equilibrium
potential, and (ii) was blocked by replacing intracellular k1
with cs1. taken together, these data provide strong evidence
for the activation of a ca21-independent k1 channel by high
[atp] in hsg cells. some previous studies with salivary gland
cells have suggested that atp induces a ca21-independent
component of k1 efflux (24, 32). it was suggested that this
component of k1 release could be due to a direct action of atp
on nonspecific cation channels on the plasma membrane. we
have not yet determined whether atp activates the ca21independent k1 channel directly or via binding to an atp
receptor. however, our data rule out the possibility that the
known p2x or p2y receptors are involved in the atp-dependent activation of the ca21-independent, inwardly rectifying, k1
channel. the charybdotoxin-insensitive k1 current was not
activated by 2mes- xxxd966xxx -atp, utp, or low [atp]. thus, the
ca21-independent k1 current appears to be selectively activated by high [atp] via a mechanism that is distinct from that
associated with the  xxxd3024xxx  or  xxxg1646xxx  receptors. significantly, the
sulfonylurea compounds,  xxxd2215xxx  and  xxxd3394xxx , inhibited the k1 current induced by high [atp] but not that
induced by low [atp], in contrast to charybdotoxin, which
inhibited only the current induced by low [atp]. these data
provide evidence for the presence of at least two pharmacologically distinct k1 channels in hsg cells: a ca21-dependent
maxi-k1 channel that is sensitive to charybdotoxin and an
inwardly rectifying k1 channel that is sensitive to sulfonylurea
compounds, probably a  xxxg1253xxx  (20, 21, 25).
two classes of katp channels are modulated by sulfonyl urea
compounds: the  xxxg1249xxx  channels and the classical katp channels (20, 21, 25). classical katp channels (kir 6.0 subfamily)
have been shown to be present in pancreatic b cells, cardiac and
skeletal myocytes, vascular smooth muscle, and neurons and
are suggested to regulate the electrical activity of these cells
(25). these katp channels have been shown to be associated
with the sulfonylurea receptors ( xxxg19xxx , sur2a, or sur2b),
which confer the sensitivity to the sulfonylurea compounds (see
ref. 25 for a review). the  xxxg1249xxx  family of katp channels (kir
1.1 family) are expressed in the nephron, where they have been
proposed to regulate k1 secretion (20, 21, 33, 34). in the case of
the  xxxg1249xxx  channels, the sensitivity to sulfonylurea compounds
has been suggested to depend on an interaction with the cftr
protein, although conclusive experimental data for a molecular
interaction between these two proteins is yet lacking (20, 21,
35). however, several observations are consistent with this
suggestion. for example both the cftr and the  xxxg1249xxx  proteins were shown to be localized in the apical membrane of the
nephron (33, 34). co-expression of the  xxxg1249xxx  protein and
cftr in oocytes conferred  xxxd2215xxx  sensitivity to the k1
current (35). further, camp stimulated both the cftr-associ-

 xxxg1249xxx  and cftr in salivary gland cells
