anabolic effects of  xxxd1714xxx  on skeletal muscle
are mediatedby &-adrenoceptor activation. am. j. physioz.263
(endocrinol. metab. 26): e50-e56, 1992.-the potent anabolic
effects of the &-adrenoceptor agonist  xxxd1714xxx  on skeletal
muscle have been reported to be independent of actions on
p-adrenoceptors.in the present study  xxxd1714xxx , presentedto
rats in the diet (4 mg/kg), causedsignificant increasesin gastrocnemius musclemass,protein, and rna content and a decreasein epididymal fat pad mass.theseeffects were not mimicked by oral administration of the &-adrenoceptor agonist
salbutamoleven at high dose(52 mg/kg diet), and the effects of
 xxxd1714xxx  were not inhibited by addition of  xxxd3033xxx 
(200 mg/kg diet). however, the selective &-antagonist
ici-118,551 (200 mg/kg diet) reversed the anabolic effects of
 xxxd1714xxx , and a high dose of  xxxd3033xxx  (1,000 mg/kg
diet) also inhibited these actions of  xxxd1714xxx . furthermore,
continuous infusion of salbutamol (1.15 mg kg body
wt-’ *day-l) via miniosmotic pumps did causesignificant increasesin musclemass,protein, and rna content. these results indicate that the anabolic effects of  xxxd1714xxx  are dependent on interaction with the &adrenoceptor. however, a long
duration of action appearsto be required to induce the anabolic
effects of &-agonists.
salbutamol;rat
l

several &-adrenoceptor
agonists have recently been
shown to exert rapid and potent anabolic effects on
skeletal muscle in a number of species (2,5, 11,28). the
most potent of these agents are  xxxd1714xxx 
and cimaterol, whereas other &- and &-adrenoceptor
agonists
are reportedly inactive (22; unpublished
observations).
over the last decade there have been extensive investigations on the anabolic effects of &-agonists,
but
mainly using  xxxd1714xxx .  xxxd1714xxx  is effective in animals of both sexes (7, 30), of different ages (4), and in
those with inherited muscular dystrophy (23), muscle
wasting associated with denervation
(1, 17, 31), endotoxemia (5), or food deprivation (6). the mechanisms of
action of  xxxd1714xxx  on muscle protein are unknown,
but dependence on changes in major anabolic hormones
such as  xxxd2864xxx   xxxd3223xxx , gonadal hormones, and insulin
have all been excluded (7, 25). changes in protein synthesis and degradation provide a useful tool for elucidating modes of action of any agent affecting muscle protein, and there have been a number of studies on changes
in muscle protein
synthesis
and degradation
by
 xxxd1714xxx . however, effects in vivo on these two parameters are varied. emery et al. (7) first reported significant increases in muscle protein synthesis in rats
treated acutely with  xxxd1714xxx  by subcutaneous injections, and this was confirmed by maclennan
and edwards (14). the increased ratio of rna to protein content of muscle observed by us (5, 6) and others (15, 19)
in  xxxd1714xxx -treated
rats is consistent
with this
observation.
in contrast, reeds et al. (21) failed to
e50

united kingdom

observe a change in muscle protein synthesis of rats
treated with  xxxd1714xxx  and suggested that anabolic effects of  xxxd1714xxx 
were dependent on inhibition
of
muscle protein degradation. however, the latter group
has subsequently reported that protein synthesis and
rna-to-protein
ratio of the muscles were elevated by
 xxxd1714xxx  feeding (15, 16). a fundamental question on
the anabolic effects of &-agonists is whether they are
dependent on interaction
with a &-adrenoceptor
or
whether they represent some other unrelated action of
those compounds. certain potent ,&-adrenoceptor
agonists such as salbutamol fail to increase muscle protein
content (22), and the anabolic action of  xxxd1714xxx  is
not attenuated by loo-fold higher of the ,&adrenoceptor
antagonist propranolol, although the body fat suppressing effect is inhibited at the same dose, indicating that
&-adrenoceptors
are not involved in the expression of
anabolic effects (22). in contrast to these data, a more
recent study (14) demonstrated that the acute effects of
 xxxd1714xxx  on muscle protein synthesis and the anabolic
effect over 7 days were prevented by a higher (loo-fold)
dose of propranolol,
which may indicate a dependence
on @adrenoceptors, although the subtype of receptor is
unknown.
the primary object of the present study was to investigate whether &-adrenoceptors
are involved in the anabolic effects of  xxxd1714xxx  and whether another &agonist, salbutamol,
can produce similar effects. this
latter point is of relevance to the potential clinical benefit of &-agonists,
since salbutamol
is more readily
available for human studies. the results indicate that
the anabolic actions of this drug are mediated by
&-adrenoceptors.
materials and methods
the animals used in this study were male sprague-dawley
rats (charles river, kent, uk) weighing 150-250g, housedin
individual cagesat 24”c, 12-h light-dark cycle, and offered a
powdereddiet (crm labsure,croydon, uk) ad libitum for 3-5
days before the commencementof the experiment in order to
allow adaptation to the environment and diet. the animalswere
weighed daily and at the beginning of each experiment
were grouped according to both body weight and weight gain
during the pretreatment period (7 days). in all experiments,
animalswere allowedfree accessto food and water. body weight
and food intake were recorded daily, taking into account any
spilt food.
at the end of each treatment, rats were killed by cervical
dislocation and gastrocnemiusmuscle was rapidly dissected,
frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70°c until analysis.
heart, liver, and epididymal fat pad were also dissectedand
weighed.
for the determination of protein, rna, and dna content,
~300 mgof musclewerehomogenizedin 10 ml of 2% perchloric
acid (pca). the homogenatewas centrifuged at 2,400 rpm for

15 min, and then the precipitate was washed twice with 2%
pca by resuspensionand centrifugation. the precipitate was
dissolvedin 5 ml of 0.3 m naoh for 1 h at 37”c, and a 100-j
aliquot wastaken for determination of protein content. a 2.5ml
aliquot wasmixed with 1 ml of 20% pca, cooledin ice water for
30 min, and centrifuged at 2,400 rpm for 15 min. the supernatant was retained for measurementof rna content. the precipitate wassuspendedin 5 ml of 8% pca, incubated for 45 min
at 7o”c, cooledin ice water for 30 min and centrifuged at 2,400
rpm for 15 min. the supernatant wasusedfor determination of
dna content. protein content wasdeterminedby a dye-binding
assay (coomassieblue reagent, bio-rad, watford, uk, using
bovine serumalbumin asstandard). rna content wasmeasured
by the ultraviolet method asdescribedby munro and fleck (20).
in this method, a possiblesourceof error is the releaseof acidsolublepeptides, during the alkali hydrolysis step, which leads
to erroneous results for rna content assessedfrom optical
density at 260 nm. this was overcome by determining peptide
content and then subtracting 0.001 od units for each microgram peptide per milliliter. dna content was determined
by the burton diphenylamine method modified by giles and
myers (8).
for measurementof  xxxg550xxx  activity, -300 mg muscle
were homogenizedin 10 ml of 1% nacl-2% n-butanol and 50 pl
. of triton x-100 wereadded.the homogenatewasleft overnight
at 4°c and then centrifuged  xxxd2274xxx ,000 rpm for 20 min. supernatant (200 ~1)containing  xxxg550xxx  was incubated with aciddenatured hemoglobin as substrate for 30 min at 37°c. the
incubation was stopped by addition of 0.3 m trichloroacetic
acid. after centrifugation, the absorbanceat 280 nm of the
acid-soluble peptides in the supernatant was measured.  xxxg550xxx  activity was expressed(in arbitrary units) as the
amount of enzyme digestedproducts that producean increasein
absorbanceof 0.01 above the blank and the zero-time tubes
at 280 nm.
resting 0, consumption (00,) was measured in closedcircuit respirometersat 29’c for 2 h (26). values for vo, were
taken only when the animals were resting and have been corrected for metabolic body size (kg0e7”).for measurementof
brown adiposetissue (bat) activity, interscapular bat was
removed from each rat, weighed, and homogenizedin 0.2 m
sucrose.mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation, and the activity of the mitochondrial proton conductance
pathway was assessedfrom the binding of [sh]gdp (2 pm)
using 200 pm unlabeled nucleotide to determine nonspecific
binding (3). in experiments 1, 2, and 6,  xxxd1714xxx  hydrochloride (313.7mol wt) wasused,but becauseof limited availability
of drug,  xxxd1714xxx  base(277.2mol wt) wasusedin experiments
3-5. in separateunpublished studies, we have observed that
both forms of  xxxd1714xxx  have identical actions on muscle
growth.

results

experiment 1

in this experiment,
effects of  xxxd1714xxx  on body weight, fat, and protein were studied.
rats were divided into two groups and fed, over 4 days,
either a normal powdered diet or a powdered diet containing  xxxd1714xxx  at the concentration of 4 mg/kg. this
dose has been shown to be maximal for producing increases in weight of gastrocnemius muscle in our previous
studies.

of  xxxd1714xxx 

resuzts.  xxxd1714xxx 
caused a significant increase in
body weight gain without affecting food intake (table 1).
average food intake was -25 grat-l-day-l.
the 29%
increase in body weight gain was associated with a 14%
increase in gastrocnemius muscle mass and 12% increase
in heart mass, but epididymal
fat pad weight was decreased by 17%. protein and rna content and the ratio
of rna to protein of gastrocnemius muscle were all increased by  xxxd1714xxx , but dna content was unaltered.
 xxxd1714xxx  had no effect on the lysosomal proteinase
 xxxg550xxx  activity in muscle.
experiment 2
experimental. in experiment 2 the effects of  xxxd1714xxx  and salbutamol were compared at equimolar doses
(4 and 7.4 mg/kg diet, respectively). rats were treated
with either  xxxd1714xxx  or salbutamol for 4 days, and effects of these drugs on muscle protein and fat mass were
compared.
results. as in experiment 1, body weight gain was significantly increased by  xxxd1714xxx , but food intake was
unaffected (table 2). salbutamol also caused a modest
increase body weight gain, but the magnitude of the increase was less than that produced by  xxxd1714xxx , and an
increase in food intake also occurred. weight, protein,
and rna content and the ratio of rna to protein of
gastrocnemius muscle were all increased by  xxxd1714xxx ,
but none of these variables was affected by salbutamol.
heart mass was elevated by  xxxd1714xxx , whereas the
weights of liver and epididymal fat pad were reduced, but
none of these changes was observed in salbutamol-treated
animals. resting vo, and bat activity (gdp binding) were
measured on day 4. neither resting \jo2 nor bat gdp
binding was changed by either  xxxd1714xxx  or salbutamol.
experiment 3
experimental. in experiment 3, the dose of salbutamol
was increased to 52 mg/kg diet. an equimolar dose of
 xxxd1714xxx  (25 mg/kg diet) was also employed, and treatments lasted for 5 days. all other experimental details as
reported in experiment 2.

of a high dose of  xxxd1714xxx 
had no effect on body weight gain but caused a significant
reduction in food intake (table 3). weights of gastrocnemius muscle and heart were significantly
increased,
whereas weights of liver and epididymal
fat pad were
decreased by  xxxd1714xxx . body weight gain, food intake,
and weight of gastrocnemius muscle were not affected by
salbutamol, but the weight of heart was significantly
increased. salbutamol had no effect on liver mass. epididymal fat pad weight was slightly but not significantly
decreased by salbutamol. resting vo, measured on day 5
was not altered by either  xxxd1714xxx  or salbutamol.
experiment 4
experimental. in this experiment
the effects of a
mixed p-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol and/or the
selective ,&-adrenoceptor
antagonist ici-l 18,551 on responses to  xxxd1714xxx  were tested. rats were divided into
four groups. one group was presented with standard powdered diet and served as control, and the other three
groups received diet containing  xxxd1714xxx  at the concentration of 4 mg/kg. in addition, diets for two of the
latter groups also contained either dl-proprardd
or ici118,551 at the 50 times higher concentration than  xxxd1714xxx  (200 mg/kg). rats were treated for 4 days.
results. in this experiment,
 xxxd1714xxx  produced a
26% increase in body weight gain without any change in
food intake (table 4). the weight, protein and rna content, and the ratio of rna to protein of gastrocnemius
muscle and weight of heart were all increased by

 xxxd1714xxx . the weight of epididymal
fat pad was reduced by 12%, but this difference did not reach statistical
significance. the simultaneous administration
of  xxxd3033xxx  did not affect any of the responses to  xxxd1714xxx .
food intake was increased in this group, probably an
action of propranolol per se, since  xxxd1714xxx  had no
effect on food intake. in contrast the same dose of ici118,551 completely prevented the changes in body weight
gain, the weight of heart, and composition of gastrocnemius muscle.
experiment 5
experimental. because of the very much lower affinity
of  xxxd3033xxx  than ici-l 18,551l for the ,&adrenoceptor (12) in this experiment,
the dose of propranolol
was increased to 1,000 mg/kg diet. four groups of six rats
were studied. rats were fed a standard powdered diet,
diet containing
 xxxd1714xxx  only, or diets containing
4 mg  xxxd1714xxx /kg
diet and 200 or 1,000 mg dlpropranolol/kg
diet over 4 days.
results. as in previous studies,  xxxd1714xxx  caused increased body weight gain and weight, protein and rna
content, and the ratio of rna to protein of gastrocnemius muscle and weight of heart (table 5). the weight of
epididymal fat pad was again reduced by  xxxd1714xxx . in
agreement with results from experiment 4, the simultaneous administration
of 200 mg propranolol/kg
diet with
 xxxd1714xxx 
did not affect any of the responses to
 xxxd1714xxx . however, 1,000 mg propranolol/kg
diet completely prevented all of the effects of  xxxd1714xxx .

experimental. the results of experiments 4 and 5 indicated that the anabolic effects of  xxxd1714xxx  are mediated by stimulation
of ,&-adrenoceptor. thus the failure
of the &-adrenoceptor
agonist salbutamol to modify muscle protein content even at high dose in experiment 3 may
be due to the relatively short duration of action of this
drug. to test this proposal, effects of chronic infusions of
salbutamol and  xxxd1714xxx  were compared.
rats were anesthetized (2% halothane in og-nzo), and
miniosmotic
pumps (alzet 21) were implanted subcutaneously over the flank and the wound was sutured. recovery of consciousness occurred within 5 min. the total
filling volume and pumping rate of osmotic pumps used
were -2 ml and 10.3 hi/h, respectively. two of the three
groups were implanted with minipumps containing either
 xxxd1714xxx  or salbutamol dissolved in sterile saline. the
delivering doses of  xxxd1714xxx 
and salbutamol
were
-0.55 and 1.15 mgekg body wt-l-day-l,
respectively,
which were almost equivalent to those of oral administration in experiment 2. the third group received
minipumps
containing only sterile saline and served as

increases in weight of gastrocnemius muscle and heart
(table 6). protein and rna content and the ratio of
rna to protein of gastrocnemius muscle were all increased by  xxxd1714xxx  and salbutamol. the magnitude of
these changes was almost identical for salbutamol and
 xxxd1714xxx . weights of liver and epididymal fat pad were
decreased by  xxxd1714xxx  but not by salbutamol. food
intake was reduced by 7% in the  xxxd1714xxx -treated

but these changes were not statistically significant. the

greater than that of  xxxd1714xxx -treated
group.  xxxd1714xxx  and salbutamol both increased resting vo2 on
day 2, but this effect was considerably attenuated on
day 4 (fig. 1) and was not associated with significant
changes in bat gdp binding (table 6).
discussion

in each of the present experiments,  xxxd1714xxx  exhibited potent anabolic effects on skeletal muscle and the
results are consistent with a number of previous studies
by ourselves (5-7) and other workers (1, 18, 22). this
anabolic effect of  xxxd1714xxx  appears to be very rapid; it
is evident within 2 days of treatment and persists for - 10
days but thereafter declines slightly in the rat despite

continued exposure (our unpublished observations).
in the present study, increases in gastrocnemius muscle
mass in  xxxd1714xxx -treated
rats were always associated
with increases in the ratio of rna to protein, which is
indicative of increased protein synthesis (29), but the
proteinase  xxxg550xxx  activity was not affected. these
results favor the view that  xxxd1714xxx  increases muscle
protein accretion through increasing protein synthesis
rather than or in addition to altering protein degradation.
a fundamental question over the mechanisms involved
in the anabolic effects of  xxxd1714xxx  is whether its actions are dependent on stimulation
of &-adrenoceptor
mechanism. reeds et al. (22) examined effects of a number of ,&agonists administered
orally on muscle growth
and fat deposition in rats. they reported no effects on the
&-agonists, terbutaline,
reproterol, and salbutamol, on
muscle protein, but body fat content was generally
suppressed. furthermore, muscle hypertrophy induced by
 xxxd1714xxx  was not attenuated by propranolol, whereas
fat depletion was attenuated. these findings have led to
the conclusion that anabolic effect of  xxxd1714xxx 
is
independent of &-adrenoceptor,
whereas the body fat

suppressing
effect is mediated
by ,&-adrenoceptor
stimulation.
we also observed that salbutamol even at
a high dose had no effect on muscle protein content
(expt 3). however, this difference between the two &adrenoceptor
agonists may relate to the very much
shorter half-life of salbutamol in vivo. this suggestion is
supported by the observation that infusion of salbutamol
caused a significant increase in muscle protein content
(expt 6). the magnitude of muscle protein increment by
salbutamol was comparable to that by  xxxd1714xxx . thus,
when the duration of action of salbutamol is prolonged by
continuous infusion, it produces very similar anabolic
effects to  xxxd1714xxx .
additional
evidence that the anabolic effect of  xxxd1714xxx  is mediated by ,&-adrenoceptor
stimulation
was
obtained from studies to assess the effects of p-adrenoceptor antagonists (expts 4 and 5). muscle hypertrophy
induced by  xxxd1714xxx  was completely prevented by administration
of the selective ,&-adrenoceptor antagonist
ici-118,551 (table 4). however, although the same dose
of propranolol failed to inhibit the anabolic effect of  xxxd1714xxx , propranolol did cause significant inhibition
at a
higher dose. it has recently been reported that simultaneous injection of  xxxd1714xxx  with propranolol at a loofold higher dose prevented the increases in muscle protein
content, protein synthetic rate, and translation efficiency
and activity induced by  xxxd1714xxx  (14). in addition,
harper and buttery (9) have recently reported that the
stimulation
of protein synthesis by the ,&-agonist cimater01 in l6 cells was inhibited by 100 times higher dose
of dl-proprandd.
these results strongly implicate the
&-adrenoceptor
in the anabolic effects of  xxxd1714xxx .
the failure of propranolol at a low dose to block anabolic
effect of  xxxd1714xxx  is probably due to its low affinity for
the p-adrenoceptor. it is unlikely that ici-118,551 itself
had effects on muscle growth since maclennan and edwards (14) observed no effects of this drug alone on muscle or heart weights. in a separate study, we observed
that, in rats fed diet containing ici-118,551 (200 mg/kg
diet) for 4 days, gastrocnemius muscle mass was almost
identical (1.08 t 0.01 g, n = 5) to that of rats fed control
diet (1.10 t 0.01) and body weight and fat pad weights
were similarly unaffected.

anabolic

effects

the protein content of heart is increased in response to
,&-agonist treatment (4, 22), and this effect was confirmed in the present study. the increase in cardiac muscle protein is associated with an increase in heart rate
(10) and is inhibited by a selective ,&-antagonist,
atenolol
(22). this cardiac hypertrophy may have resulted from
cardiac overload, presumably through reflex tachycardia
rather than by a direct anabolic effect of  xxxd1714xxx .
 xxxd1714xxx  increases body weight gain, but the magnitude of this increase is usually smaller than the change
in muscle protein content because of a simultaneous decrease in adipose tissue mass. in the experiments presented here, fat mass, assessed from the mass of epididyma1 fat pad, was reduced by 17-26% in clenbuteroltreated rats, and in earlier studies we have reported
decreases in total body fat content determined by carcass
analysis (24). fat mobilization
induced by  xxxd1714xxx 
may be due to lipolytic (12, 19) and thermogenic effects
through stimulation
of bat (27). however, these
effects appear to be transient. it has been reported that
subcutaneous injections of  xxxd1714xxx  cause an acute increase in resting voz and bat activity assessed by gdp
binding (fig. 1). in the present study, resting vo, was
increased after 2 days of  xxxd1714xxx  infusion, but neither
tjob nor bat activity was altered after 4 days of treatment regardless of the route of administration,
indicating
that the effects of  xxxd1714xxx  on metabolic rate and bat
thermogenesis are rapidly tolerated.
although the data presented here suggest that anabolic
effects of  xxxd1714xxx  are dependent on &-adrenoceptor
activation, these may not necessarily involve the same
mechanisms as the changes in body fat content. ici118,551 inhibited the effect of  xxxd1714xxx  on muscle protein accretion but had little or no effect on epididymal fat
pad mass (table 4). similarly, a high dose of propranolol
inhibited muscle growth induced by  xxxd1714xxx  but did
not significantly modify fat accretion in spite of reduced
food intake (table 5). salbutamol
infusion (table 6)
stimulated protein deposition but did not influence fat
mass, even though vo, and bat activity were increased.
in summary, the results of this study indicate that the
anabolic effects of  xxxd1714xxx  are dependent on a ,&-type
of adrenoceptor, since they can be mimicked by infusion
of salbutamol and inhibited by the selective &-adrenoceptor antagonist ici- 118,551. however, because salbutamol was only effective when infused continuously, a long
duration of action of the compound is probably essential
for anabolic actions. the marked difference in sensitivity
to injected  xxxd1714xxx  and salbutamol raises the possibility that an “atypical” &-adrenoceptor
may be involved
in growth promotion. furthermore, because the effects of
,&-selective antagonists were not tested, the involvement
of & for the recently identified &-adrenoceptors
cannot
be excluded. the anabolic actions of salbutamol demonstrated in the rat indicate that this compound may be of
value in human studies. our preliminary data have shown
that daily oral administration
of “slow-release” salbutamol causes significant
increases in voluntary muscle
strength in normal human volunteers within 2-3 wk
