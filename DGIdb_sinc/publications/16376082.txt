abstract—fentanyl is a highly potent and clinically widely used narcotic analgesic. the synthesis of its analogs remains a challenge
in the attempt to develop highly selective l-opioid receptor agonists with speciﬁc pharmacological properties. in this paper, the use
of ﬂexible molecular docking in a study of the formation of complexes between a series of active fentanyl analogs and the l-opioid
receptor is described. the optimal position and orientation of fourteen fentanyl analogs in the binding pocket of the l-receptor were
determined. the major receptor amino acids and the ligand functional groups participating in the complex formation were identiﬁed. stereochemical eﬀects on the potency and binding are explained. the proposed model of ligand–receptor binding is in agreement with point mutation experiments explaining the role of the amino acids: asp147, tyr148, asn230, his297, trp318, his319,
cys321, and tyr326 in the complex formation. in addition, the following amino acids were identiﬁed as being important for ligand
binding or receptor activation: ile322, gly325, val300, met203, leu200, val143, and ile144.

1. introduction
the l-opioid receptor is the primary site of action in the
brain for opioid neuropeptides as well as opiate drugs. it
is a member of the seven trans-membrane (tm) domain,
g protein-coupled (gpcr) receptor superfamily, figure 1, which is believed to share a common topology
and a common mechanism of action. one hypothesis1b,k
proposes that an agonist binding to g protein-coupled
receptors promotes a conformational change which
leads to the formation of the activated receptor state.
another hypothesis2 suggests that a rigid body
movement of helices relative to one another is the key
step in receptor activation. however, the character of
these changes, which link agonist binding and g protein
coupling and activation, is not known. it is the subject
of intensive modeling1 and experimental studies including receptor cloning, site-directed mutagenesis, and
aﬃnity labeling studies.3

fentanyl is a highly selective l-opioid agonist4 with speciﬁc pharmacological properties.5 substitution on the
piperidine ring of fentanyl was shown to dramatically
aﬀect the binding and activity of the ligand, table 1.
substitution by an acetate,6 or methoxymethyl7 group
at the  xxxd733xxx -axial position, greatly increased the
ligand binding and potency, while 4-methyl substitution8 aﬀected the potency to a lesser extent. substitution
of the n-phenethyl group generally prevented ligand
binding and rendered the ligand impotent.9 fentanyl
also displays great variation in enantiospeciﬁc binding
and potency. the two enantiomers of cis-3-methylfentanyl exhibit a great variation in in vivo potency and binding,1e,10 one being ca. twenty times more potent than
fentanyl, and the other ca. ﬁve times less potent, table
1. this is even more pronounced in the case of 2 0 -hydroxy-3-methylfentanyl,11 where two of the eight stereoisomers belong to the ôsuper potentõ class of l-selective
agonists (2 0 r,3r,4s and 2 0 s,3r,4s), while their antipodes are less potent than fentanyl and are only weakly
bound to the receptor. on the other hand, both diastereoisomers of 3-carbomethoxy fentanyl exhibited in vivo
potency weaker than fentanyl itself.12
on comparison of fentanyl with classical l-opioids such
as morphine, certain structural similarities may be noticed, that is, a protonated nitrogen and an aromatic

group. however, sar studies13 have suggested that
fentanyl and morphine may exhibit qualitatively similar
pharmacological proﬁles but through diﬀerent
mechanisms.
all this makes fentanyl analogs interesting probes for
ascertaining the stereochemical requirements for ligand–receptor binding and for testing the mechanisms
of receptor activation, in both experimental and modeling studies.
experimental studies on fentanyl analogs and their
interactions with l-receptor include: site-directed mutagenesis,16 studies of chimeric receptors,17 and aﬃnity

labeling experiments.18 chimeric receptor studies17 revealed that the major determinant for binding of l-selective alkaloids exists in the region spanning the
transmembrane segments  xxxg2318xxx  to tm7. it was demonstrated3c using l/j chimeras that tm6 and tm7, as well
as a third extracellular (e3) loop of l-receptor, were
important for the binding of agonists, such as morphine
and fentanyl analogs, while the ﬁrst extracellular loop
(e1) is not important for l-selective nonpeptide ligands.
site-directed mutagenesis studies of the l-receptor indicated that asp147 is the primary binding site, as the
counterion for the protonated nitrogen of the opioid ligands. the importance of charged residues in tm2 (asp
114),  xxxg2318xxx  (asp147), and tm6 (his297) has been demonstrated,16 as has the modest involvement of n- and cterminal domains in the ligand–receptor interactions.
however, it was later19 proven that the n-terminal domain of the l-opioid receptor may be important for
the binding of some alkaloid agents, such as fentanyl
and methadone, and for some peptide agonists. furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis studies13c established
the importance of the tm7 residue tyr326, especially
for the fentanyl class of opiate ligands, while mutation
of asn150 to ala produced only a slight increase in ligand binding. additional site-directed mutagenesis studies13c,21 stressed the importance of trp318 and his319 in
tm7 and tyr148 in  xxxg2318xxx  for the activation of l-opioid
receptor by fentanyl analogs, and the importance22 of
the boundary regions between the sixth and the seventh
transmembrane domains, and the third extracellular
loop, for the distinction between l- and j-opioid receptors. the cys321 residue in tm7 of the l-opioid receptor was found23 to participate in ligand binding. in line
with these studies, it was established24 that ser196 of
tm4 is important not for ligand binding but, most
likely, for maintaining the receptor conformation. it
was also established by mutation experiments25a that
asn230 of  xxxg2318xxx  is involved in the binding of morphine
and, to a much lesser extent, of fentanyl. binding of opioid peptides, on the other hand, was unaﬀected by mutation of asn230 to thr or leu. site-directed mutagenesis

experiments25b also suggested hydrophobic interactions
of ser329 (tm7) with the n-phenethyl group of the fentanyl molecule. the third intracellular loop was found26
to be involved in activation of the l-opioid receptor. its
interaction with g-proteins was found to be agonistselective. in addition, as a result of some mutagenesis
studies,13b,27,28 it was suggested that the interaction of
morphine with the l-receptor during activation is diﬀerent to that of fentanyl analogs.
the gpcrs of pharmaceutical interest, including the lopioid receptor, are membrane-bound proteins but their
3d structures are unknown at present. therefore, in order to gain a detailed insight into the key interactions
between the ligand and the receptor, molecular models
based on bacteriorhodopsin or rhodopsin templates of
the various gpcrs have been developed.1a,b,c despite
inherent diﬃculties in the modeling of opioid receptors
at the molecular level, several models of l-opioid receptor are available.1e,j,30,31 however, there are very few
systematic studies of receptor–ligand interactions of fentanyl class of opiates. the existing two studies1e,30 used
ômanual dockingõ to a predeﬁned binding cavity30 or rigid ligand docking.1e the resulting bound conformation
and orientation of cis-3-methylfentanyl were diﬀerent
in these two studies.
in this study, a representative series of fentanyl analogs,
table 2, was ﬂexibly docked to a model of the human

2889

l-opioid receptor. the goal was to evaluate the binding
orientations, and conformations of fentanyl and its analogs, and to study the eﬀects of ligand stereochemistry
on the formation of the receptor–ligand complex. the
results are compared with the available experimental
data in order to identify the key ligand–receptor interactions involved in the molecular recognition process. a
possible mechanism of l-opioid receptor activation is
discussed.
2. computational methods
all computations were performed using a pentium iv
computer. the l-receptor model used in this study was
the one suggested by ferguson and co-workers1e and
kindly made available through www.opiod.unm.edu.
the rigid receptor model was used. the automated ﬂexible ligand docking experiments were made with the
autodock 3.0.5. program.32 the starting geometries
of the neutral ligands were taken from previous studies.33a,b these geometries satisfy the suggested fentanyl
pharmacophore33a by having the piperidine ring in the
chair conformation, the n-phenethyl and n-phenylpropanamide substituents both equatorial, with the anilido
phenyl a-oriented. the amide bond had the trans conﬁguration and the n-phenethyl substituent adopted an
extended conformation, table 2. based on the pka
values of several fentanyl derivatives,34 these starting

geometries were protonated and the protonated geometries of 1–14 were optimized using the semiempirical
am1 method of the hyperchem program.35 the ab initio like partial charges, calculated by the vcharge program,36 were assigned to the ligand atoms. the
60 · 60 · 60 grid was centered on one of the asp147
oxygen atoms and the lamarckian genetic algorithm
(lga) was used in all docking calculations. the docking process was performed in two steps. in the ﬁrst short
step, consisting of 200 lga runs, the initial position of
the ligand was random. the population was 50, the
maximum number of generations was 27,000, and the
maximum number of energy evaluations was limited to
250,000. the best ligand orientation in the ﬁrst step,
based on the score criteria, was used as the input position for the second docking step, where the number of
energy evaluations was 2.5 · 106. the second step provided the most probable ligand geometries and orientations in the binding pocket. the resultant ligand
orientations and conformations were scored based on
the docking and binding energies (the cutoﬀ value for
the energies was 2 kcal/mol) and on the distance of
asp147 to the protonated nitrogen of a ligand (the cutoﬀ value for the distance was 4.0 å). site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown37 that asp147 to ala/asn or
glu point mutations lead to diminished binding aﬃnities, presumably due to the loss of a salt bridge or an
electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged
asp147 and the protonated nitrogen of the ligand.
3. results and discussion
automated docking of compounds 1–14 to the tm domain of the l-opioid receptor resulted in several plausible docking orientations and conformations for each
ligand. the resulting ligand orientations and conformations were scored based on the docking and binding
energies and the distance between asp147 and the protonated nitrogen of the ligand. only a few met these
criteria and they were further evaluated based on exper-

imental results indicating the important amino acids
constituting the ligand binding site within the receptor.
all the selected (ôbestõ) ligand orientations have low
energies (within 2 kcal/mol above the minimum energy
orientation). hence, stable complexes are formed between the receptor and a ligand in the selected orientation. however, the correlation between the calculated
binding energies and the experimentally determined
binding aﬃnities was poor. also, the calculated binding
energies were consistently higher than the experimentally determined binding aﬃnities. this problem may be
due to uncertainties in the side-chain conformations of
the receptor model,1e as well as to the fact that possible
conformational rearrangements of the receptor upon
ligand binding were neglected.32
the best fentanyl (1) docking orientation positions the
piperidine ring vertically in the region between the transmembrane helices  xxxg2318xxx  and tm7. the protonated
nitrogen is close to asp147 of  xxxg2318xxx  (+nh  o distance
is 3.38 å). the n-phenylpropanamide group is oriented
toward the extracellular side of the cavity, while the nphenethyl group is not extended but adopts a gauche
conformation placing the phenyl group between tm6
and tm7, figure 2a. the only other fentanyl orientation which meets the energy and distance criteria
(hn+  o distance 3.80 å) is the one in which the fentanyl molecule is positioned horizontally across the
region between  xxxg2318xxx ,tm4, xxxg2318xxx , and tm7, at the extracellular edge of the transmembrane domain, figure 2b.
however, the vertically aligned structure is not only
slightly lower in energy but also complies better with
the experimental data. in addition, the salt bridge
formed between asp147 and the n-phenethyl group is
oriented so that its phenyl group is close to his297 in
tm6 and may have a strong donor–acceptor interaction
with the imidazole ring. these two ligand–receptor
interactions may be very important for l-receptor activation by fentanyl and its analogs. electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy on rhodopsin2 suggested,
for instance, rigid body movement of helices  xxxg2318xxx  and

tm6 relative to each other, upon light activation. on
the other hand, the n-phenylpropanamide group is close
to trp318 and his319 of tm7, and oriented in such a
way that the ethyl group may have non-polar (van der
waals) interactions with the aromatic part of trp318,
while the phenyl group is oriented toward his319. the
tyr148 of  xxxg2318xxx  is close to the hydrocarbon part of the
piperidine ring, and the tyr326 of tm7 is close to the
–ch2–ch2– bridge of the n-phenethyl group. moreover, the strong eﬀect of the mutation of tyr326 to
phe on the binding of fentanyl13c suggests that, in addition to this nonpolar interaction with the n-phenethyl
group of the ligand, the tyr326 may play a role in the
stabilization of receptor conformation. according to
the receptor model used, tyr326 (tm7) forms a hydrogen bond with ala117 (tm2). its mutation to phe would
prevent the formation of this hydrogen bond and, possibly, aﬀect the conformation of the receptor in this region. the carbonyl group of cys321 (tm7) is close to
the n-phenethyl phenyl group of the ligand, suggesting
that any change in the electron density of the phenyl
may aﬀect this interaction. finally, asn230 ( xxxg2318xxx ) is
close to the alkyl group of the n-phenylpropanamide
group of the ligand, which is in agreement with the
experimental ﬁnding that mutation of asn230 ( xxxg2318xxx )
to the more hydrophobic thr or leu increased the
potency of the fentanyl, presumably by strengthening
hydrophobic ligand–receptor interactions. hence, this
orientation of fentanyl was taken as the most probable,
the ôbest,õ fentanyl alignment in the binding pocket of
the l-receptor, figure 2a. the other amino acid residues, not selected for point mutation experiments, but
important according to our docking studies are: hydrophobic val300 (tm6) and ile322 (tm7), as well as
gly325 (tm7) surrounding the n-phenethyl phenyl
group of the ligand. the ile322 (tm7) and gly (tm7)
together with tyr326 (tm7) are also close to the
–ch2ch2– bridge of the n-phenethyl group. the protonated nitrogen, nh+ group, in addition to being close
to asp147 ( xxxg2318xxx ), is also close to ile322 (tm7). this
amino acid, ile322 (tm7), is also close to the other
piperidine ring atoms and seems to be the major group
responsible for the speciﬁc potency of cis-3-methylfentanyl. the ethyl group of the n-phenylpropanamide substituent of the ligand is in the pocket surrounded by
met203 (tm4), leu200(tm4), asn230 ( xxxg2318xxx ) and the
aromatic ring of trp318 (tm7). the phenyl ring of
the n-phenylpropanamide substituent is surrounded by
trp318 (tm7) and his319 (tm7) on the one side, and
val143 ( xxxg2318xxx ) and ile144 ( xxxg2318xxx ) on the other side.
all the other studied active analogs of fentanyl adopted
very similar conformations and alignments in the binding pocket.
3.1. p-fluorofentanyl (2)
the lowest energy p-ﬂuorofentanyl-receptor complex
has the p-ﬂuorofentanyl molecule aligned so that it overlaps the ôbestõ fentanyl structure. the ﬂuorine atom in
the para position is oriented toward the region between
val143 ( xxxg2318xxx ) and his319 (tm7). the electrostatic
interactions between the polar c–f bond and the posi-

2891

tively charged his319 (tm7) may facilitate ligand binding and therefore explain the enhanced potency of
p-ﬂuorofentanyl relative to fentanyl and its sensitivity
to his319 (tm7) mutation.20
3.2.  xxxd440xxx  (3)
 xxxd440xxx  is one of the most potent fentanyl analogs.
earlier pharmacophore modeling studies33 suggested
that the activity of fentanyl analogs is highly sensitive
to the negative charge density in the region between
the anilido oxygen and the c4 substituent of the piperidine ring. the docking results support this suggestion.
the ôbestõ  xxxd440xxx  conformation overlaps the ôbestõ
fentanyl conformation and positions the partially negative methoxy oxygen close to the protonated nitrogen of
his297 (o  hn+ distance 3.9 å). this interaction
underlines the importance of the relative position of
 xxxg2318xxx  and tm6 for l-receptor activation by fentanyl
analogs.
3.3. 4-methylfentanyl (4)
as with the other studied fentanyl analogs, 4-methylfentanyl has a number of possible orientations between
the seven transmembrane helices. in the lowest energy
ligand–receptor complex, the 4-methylfentanyl molecule is positioned in such a way that the protonated
nitrogen of the piperidine ring was far from asp147
(distance > 7.0 å). the alternative ligand orientation,
having a slightly higher energy, overlaps the ôbestõ fentanyl conformation, except that the piperidine ring is
rotated relative to fentanyl by about 60 degrees, positioning the 4-methyl group in the hydrophobic pocket
between tyr148 ( xxxg2318xxx ), ile144 ( xxxg2318xxx ), and leu200
(tm4). in this orientation, the protonated nitrogen
and asp147 ( xxxg2318xxx ) have an acceptable distance
(o  +nh distance 4.2 å) and additional hydrophobic interactions of the 4-methyl group may be related
to the threefold increase in the potency of 4-methylfentanyl relative to fentanyl.
3.4. 3-methylfentanyls (5–8)
substitution at position 3 of the piperidine ring produced some of the most potent fentanyl analogs. the
(3r,4s)-cis-3-methylfentanyl (5) (r2=ax-ch3) is about
twenty times more potent than fentanyl. however, the
potencies of 3-alkylfentanyls are highly stereosensitive,
hence, the (3s,4s)-trans isomer (7) (r2=eq-ch3) is
only three times more active than fentanyl, while the
(3s,4r)-cis-3-methylfentanyl (6) (r4=ax-ch3) and
(3r,4r)-trans-3-methylfentanyl (8) (r4=eq-ch3) are
both less active than fentanyl. the potency is known
to depend on the size of the alkyl group: 3-propyland 3-allyl-substitution leads to diminished activity,14
suggesting the existence of a small hydrophobic pocket
in the receptor. according to the present docking studies, the geometries of the three isomers of low potency;
(6), (7), and (8) in the binding pocket are very similar
and overlap the ôbestõ fentanyl orientation, while that
of the most potent of the 3-methylfentanyls, (5), is
diﬀerent.

2892

l. dosen-micovic et al. / bioorg. med. chem. 14 (2006) 2887–2895

the molecule of (3s,4s)-trans-3-methylfentanyl (7)
overlaps that of fentanyl and places the equatorial 3methyl group (r2=eq-ch3) toward the hydrophobic
pocket surrounded by trp318 (tm7), ile322 (tm7),
ile301 (tm6), and phe237 ( xxxg2318xxx ), that is, between the
transmembrane helices  xxxg2318xxx , tm6, and tm7. ile 322
in tm7 seems to be the key residue for the discrimination between the stereoisomers of 3-methylfentanyl. its
location near the 3-hax (r2=hax) in the ôbestõ fentanyl
orientation makes this orientation inaccessible to any
analog with a voluminous substituent at the 3-ax
(r2=ax-substituent) position, forcing the molecule to
adopt a diﬀerent orientation. steric interactions have
also been proposed38 as being responsible for the selectivity of naltrexone-derived ligands against the three
opioid receptors. the increased potency of the (3s,4s)trans isomer (7), figure 3, relative to fentanyl, is probably due to favorable hydrophobic interactions of the
methyl group in the pocket.
the two least active 3-methylfentanyls, (8) and (6), overlap the ôbestõ fentanyl orientation but the 3-methylgroup (r4=ax-ch3 or eq-ch3) is oriented away from
the hydrophobic pocket, and toward asp147, where it
has unfavorable steric interactions. this steric crowding
is particularly unfavorable in (6), increasing its docking
energy and may be responsible for its reduced potency,
relative to other isomers. the most potent of the four
stereoisomers is (5). although it occupies the same binding pocket as the other three isomers, the position and
orientation of the molecule are diﬀerent, figure 4. it is
rotated and shifted relative to the other three isomers
in order to relieve the steric interactions of the axial 3methyl group (r2=ax-ch3) and ile322 (tm7) in the
hydrophobic pocket between helices  xxxg2318xxx , tm6, and
tm7. while maintaining a good salt bridge (hn+  o
distance 3.73 å), a molecule in this orientation connects
 xxxg2318xxx  and tm6 through the n-phenethyl group, which
has favorable edge-to-face interactions with the imidaz-

ole ring in his297 (tm6). simultaneously, the n-phenylpropanamide phenyl group is much closer to trp318
(tm7) and his319 (tm7) than in the case of fentanyl itself. considering the importance of the boundary region
between tm6, tm7, and the third extracellular loop for
both the activity and selectivity of opioid ligands, this
proximity may explain the exceptional potency of this
isomer of 3-methylfentanyl.
3.5. 3-carbomethoxy fentanyl (9–10)
in order to test the hypothesis of a hydrophobic pocket
accommodating the 3-alkyl group of 3-alkylfentanyls,
the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of 3-carbomethoxy fentanyl isomers (9) and (10) were performed.12 both stereoisomers, (9) and (10), were
considerably less potent, table 1, than their 3-methyl
counterparts. in the present docking studies on
(3r,4s)-9 (r2=ax-cooch3) and (3s,4s)-10 (r2=eqcooch3) 3-carbomethoxy fentanyls, it was found that
the best orientation of the (3r,4s)-9 overlaps the ôbestõ
orientation of (5). the polar carbomethoxy group occupies the hydrophobic pocket of the receptor, which may
explain its reduced activity. it was found earlier12 that
the trans-3-carbomethoxy fentanyl is more conformationally ﬂexible than the cis isomer, and its global minimum conformation has the anilido phenyl b-oriented,
which is known to be an inactive conformation.29 its orientation in the binding pocket is equivalent to that of
the less potent 3-methylfentanyl (7).
the other two stereoisomers (3s,4r)-9 (r4=axcooch3) and (3r,4r)-10 (r4=eq-cooch3) cannot
adopt the ôbestõ fentanyl-like orientation at all, due to
the unfavorable steric and electrostatic interactions of
the 3-carbomethoxy group with asp147 ( xxxg2318xxx ). this
further diminishes the pharmacological potency of
3-carbomethoxy fentanyl.

the introduction of the 2 0 -hydroxy group has a pronounced eﬀect on the potency. the (2 0 r,3r,4s) isomer
(11) (r2=ax-ch3, r3=2 0 r-oh) has reduced activity relative to (5), while the (2 0 s,3r,4s) isomer (12) (r2=axch3, r3=2 0 s-oh) has an activity considerably higher
than that of (5). the docking studies revealed that both
molecules have their best orientation similar to that of
(5). however, the 2 0 -hydroxy-group is oriented in the
opposite direction in the two isomers, figure 5a. in
(12), it is oriented toward asp147, allowing an additional hydrogen bond to be formed (oh  o distance is
3.91 å). hence, the protonated nitrogen (+nh  o distance 3.89 å) and the 2 0 -hydroxy-group in (12) work
cooperatively to establish a better association between
the ligand and the receptor. however, the action of these
two groups is opposed in (11). the 2 0 -hydroxy-group
forms a hydrogen bond with his297 (oh  hn+ distance 3.47 å), but at the expense of increasing the distance between asp147 and the protonated nitrogen
(+nh  o distance 4.37 å) of the ligand, thus weakening their interaction.
the other two isomers, the (2 0 r,3s,4r) isomer (13)
(r4=ax-ch3, r3=2 0 r-oh) and the (2 0 s,3s,4r) isomer
(14) (r4=ax-ch3, r3=2 0 s-oh), were expected to have
low potency since they were derived from (6), a relatively barely active 3-methylfentanyl, with only 0.16 of the
activity of fentanyl. according to the docking experiment the best orientation of (13) is similar to the best
orientation of (6). the 2 0 r-hydroxy group is not so close
to asp147 (oh  o distance is 4.31 å) to make an
important contribution. on the other hand (14),
although inactive, binds better to the l-receptor than
(13), table 1. its binding to the receptor, in the fentanyl-like orientation, is assisted by the 2 0 s-hydroxy
group, figure 5b.
however, the reduced activities of (11), (13), and (14),
relative to the parent isomers of 3-methylfentanyl, are

2893

probably due to the existence of other low energy molecular orientations hydrogen bonded to asn147 through
the 2 0 -hydroxy group. the binding of some of the 2 0 -hydroxy-3-methylfentanyl isomers to the region between
tm1, tm2, and  xxxg2318xxx  was suggested earlier,11b based
on experimental data. contrary to (12), where the
molecular orientations ﬁtting the tm1, tm2, and
 xxxg2318xxx  region have binding and docking energies higher
than the energies of the fentanyl-like orientation, the situation is opposite in the case of (11), (13), and (14),
where these orientations (horizontal) dominate, presumably leading to inactive receptor–ligand complexes.
it has been suggested2 that rigid body movement of helices  xxxg2318xxx  and tm6 relative to each other is essential for
rhodopsin activation. also, random mutations of the
human d-opioid receptor,39 demonstrated that a number
of diﬀerent mutations may activate gpcrs to various
extents. four groups of activating mutations have been
identiﬁed,39 one very close to the region of the binding
pocket of fentanyl analogs in the l-receptor. the movement of helices  xxxg2318xxx , tm6, and tm7 during the activation process was suggested.39 by analogy, the
mechanism of l-opioid receptor activation by fentanyl
analogs may be described. the molecule slips into the
binding pocket with the n-phenethyl group leading.
on entering the binding pocket, the ligand binds to
 xxxg2318xxx  and tm6 causing the two helices to move relative
to each other, while, at the same time, the n-phenylpropanamide group interacts with tm2, tm6, and tm7
amino acids near the extracellular side of the receptor,
destabilizing the mutual interaction between tm6 and
tm7, as well as with amino acids of the e3 extracellular
loop.
however, the employed receptor model had neither
extracellular or intracellular loops nor n- and c-terminal domains, hence their eﬀects on ligand binding could
not be modeled. furthermore, some amino acid residues, known from point mutation studies to aﬀect
ligand binding of fentanyls, such as asn150 ( xxxg2318xxx )

and ser329 (tm7), or binding of some other l-selective
alkaloids, such as asp114 (tm2), are far from the binding pocket located in this study. these three amino acids
are in close proximity to each other, suggesting the potential existence of the second binding pocket between
helices tm2,  xxxg2318xxx , and tm7, which is supported by chimeric receptor studies.11b it is also possible that mutation of asn150 and asp114, both forming hydrogen
bonds connecting tm2 and  xxxg2318xxx , makes the formation
of these hydrogen bonds impossible, which aﬀects the
conformation of the receptor.
4. conclusion
in the present study, an automated docking procedure
was applied in order to determine the optimal position
and orientation of the fourteen fentanyl analogs in the
binding pocket of the l-opioid receptor, and to identify
the major amino acids and the major functional groups
of the ligand which participate in the formation of a
receptor–ligand complex. the quality of the models of
the receptor–ligand complexes was estimated on the basis of their binding and docking energies, the distance
between asp147 ( xxxg2318xxx ) and the protonated amine nitrogen of the ligand, and the agreement with point-mutation experimental data.
it was shown that all the active compounds occupy the
same binding pocket in the receptor, located near the
extracellular region and between the transmembrane
helices  xxxg2318xxx  to tm7. the ligand molecule is parallel
to the transmembrane helices, with the n-phenylpropanamide group pointing to the extracellular region, and
the n-phenethyl group placed deep in the pocket. the
n-phenethyl group is in the gauche conformation, positioning the phenyl group in the region between tm6 and
tm7.
the model is in agreement with point mutation experiments and explains the role and importance of the following amino acids: asp147 and tyr148 in  xxxg2318xxx ,
asn230 in  xxxg2318xxx , his297 in tm6, and trp318, his319,
cys321, and tyr326 in tm7 to the formation and stability of a complex. in addition, the following amino acids
were predicted to be involved in ligand binding or activation, by the modeling studies described here: ile322
and gly325 in tm7, val300 in tm6, met203 and
leu200 intm4, and val143 and ile144 in  xxxg2318xxx . steric
interactions in the binding pocket have a major impact
on the potency of fentanyl analogs.
we believe that the model proposed here satisfactorily
explains the structure–activity relationships observed
in the fentanyl class of opiates, as well as most of
the available site-directed mutagenesis experiments.
the major amino acids participating in the complex
formation were identiﬁed and may be used to guide
point mutations. the results related to the functional
groups of the ligands and the type of their interactions
with the receptor may suggest modiﬁcations which
may lead to the discovery of new active analogs of
fentanyl.
