1. introduction
presynaptic a 2-adrenoceptors mediate several responses in gastrointestinal tract. they are involved in the
regulation of gastric acid secretion and activation of a 2adrenoceptors may result in gastric protection against different types of mucosal damage ždijoseph et al., 1987;
blandizzi et al., 1995; gyires, 1997..
the antisecretory effect of a 2-adrenoceptor stimulants
may be mediated by both peripheral and central a 2-adrenoceptors žcheng et al., 1981; pascaud et al., 1983.. recently, it was demonstrated that gastroprotection can also
be initiated by the activation of central a 2-adrenoceptors
žgyires et al., to be published..
the aim of the present study was partly to analyse
which a 2-adrenoceptor subtypes might be involved in the
central gastroprotective effect of clonidine. namely, different subtypes of a 2-adrenoceptors have been recognised,
named a 2a , a 2b , a 2c and a 2d ; a 2c - and a 2d -adrenoceptors show pharmacological profiles very close to those of

a 2b and a 2a binding sites, respectively. a 2a -receptors
display high affinity to oxymethazoline and low affinity to
 xxxd3000xxx  and arc-239, while converse selectivity for these
drugs are shown by a 2b - and a 2c -receptor subtypes
žbylund, 1992; bylund et al., 1988..
our previous results showed that a 2b -adrenoceptor subtype is likely to be involved in the gastroprotective effect
of a 2-adrenoceptor stimulants following peripheral administration žgyires, 1997.. on the other hand, it is well
known that several responses induced by clonidine involve
opioidergic mechanism žfarsang et al., 1980., therefore,
the possible involvement of central opioid system in the
mucosal defence induced by clonidine has also been analysed.
gastric mucosal damage was induced by acidified
ethanol žacid-independent ulcer model. in the rat. the
effect of intracerebroventricularly ži.c.v.. injected antagonists of a 2-adrenoceptors žyohimbine,  xxxd3000xxx , arc 239.
and opioid receptors žnaloxone, a non-selective, moderately m-opioid receptor preferring antagonist; naltrindole,
d-opioid receptor antagonist; and naltriben, selective d 2opioid receptor antagonist. on gastroprotective effect of
clonidine has been analysed.

2. materials and methods
2.1. gastric mucosal lesions induced by acidified ethanol
experiments were performed in male wistar rats weighing 140–160 g žcharles river, hungary.. after 24 h of
food deprivation, the animals were given 0.5 ml of acidified ethanol ž98% ethanol in 200 mmolrl hcl. orally. an
hour later, the animals were killed by overdose of ether,
the stomachs were excised and examined for lesions. the
compounds were injected orally žp.o.. 40 min, subcutaneously žs.c.. 30 min and i.c.v. 10 min before the oral
administration of acidified ethanol. the i.c.v. injection to
the lateral ventricle was performed according to noble et
al. ž1967. in conscious rats. the site of i.c.v. injection was
2 mm from either side of the midline on the line drawn

through the anterior base of the ears. the volume of i.c.v.
injection was 0.01 ml. the antagonists were given i.c.v. 10
min before the central injection, and 10 and 20 min after
the s.c. and oral administration of the substances respectively. the mucosal lesions were examined by an observer
who was unaware of the treatment the rats received. the
gross mucosal damage was assessed by calculating a lesion
index based on the number and length of haemorrhagic
mucosal necrosis, as described previously žgyires, 1990..

clonidine in the dose of 470 pmolrrat i.c.v. inhibited
the gastric mucosal lesion induced by acidified ethanol by

133

80%. yohimbine ž50 nmolrrat.,  xxxd3000xxx  ž5 nmolrrat.
and arc-239 ž10, 50 nmolrrat. antagonised the gastroprotective effect of clonidine however lower doses ž5 and
0.5 nmolrrat. of yohimbine and  xxxd3000xxx , respectively,
failed to exert significant inhibitory effect on clonidine-induced protective effect žfig. 1..
the opioid antagonists naloxone in higher dose ž50
nmolrrat. and naltrindole ž5, 0.5 nmolrrat. had similar
action, inhibited the mucosal protective effect of clonidine.
naltriben also decreased the gastroprotective effect of
clonidine, although the evaluation of interaction was complicated by the fact that naltriben per se decreased the
 xxxd102xxx induced gastric damage.
3.2. the effect of i.c.õ. injection of naltrindole on the
gastroprotectiõe effect of dadle and clonidine-injected
either centrally or peripherally (subcutaneously or orally)
both dadle ž0.8 nmolrrat i.c.v.. and clonidine ž0.47
nmolrrat i.c.v.. inhibited the  xxxd102xxx induced gastric mucosal lesions by more than 80%. the doses of clonidine
and dadle were selected on the basis of previous dose–
response studies. the gastroprotective effect of both substances was antagonised by naltrindole ž0.5 nmolrrat
i.c.v... however, when clonidine ž94 nmolrkg p.o.. and
dadle ž32 nmolrkg s.c.. were injected peripherally,
naltrindole antagonised the effect of clonidine but not that
of dadle žfig. 2..

investigations on gastric mucosal protective mechanisms are focused mainly on the local mucosal processes.
however, recently involvement of central components in
gastric mucosal protection has also been raised žtache´ et
al., 1994, 1998; guidobono et al., 1998; yang et al.,
1999.. in our present experimental series, it was demonstrated that gastroprotection žor cytoprotection. could be
initiated by the activation of central a 2-adrenoceptors.
in the light of several subclasses of a 2-adrenoceptors, it
was appropriate to consider whether discriminable pharmacology might exist for centrally induced gastroprotection. namely, in contrast with binding studies, the evidences from functional investigations have been less convincing, and there are only few in vivo studies, which
demonstrate alpha-adrenoceptor subtype-mediated pharmacological actions. for example, a 2a - and a 2br2c -adrenoceptor subtypes were found to be involved in producing
fever in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide žbencsics
et al., 1995. and a 2 non-a subclasses of receptors was
suggested to be involved in spinal anti-nociceptive effect
žtakano and yaksh, 1992.. moreover, a 2a -adrenoceptor
subtype was supposed to be involved in the modulation of
acid secretion induced by vagal stimulation in the rat
žblandizzi et al., 1995., and our data showed that the

134

k. gyires et al.r european journal of pharmacology 396 (2000) 131–135

cytoprotectivergastroprotective effect of peripherally administered clonidine in different ulcer models is likely to
be mediated by a 2b -adrenoceptor subtype žgyires, 1997..
clonidine was shown to exert a dose-dependent inhibition
injected i.c.v. on gastric mucosal damage induced by
acidified ethanol žgyires et al., to be published.. our
present observation suggests that the clonidine-induced
gastroprotection may be due to the activation of central
a 2-, particularly a 2b -adrenoceptors. namely, the gastroprotective effect of clonidine-given i.c.v. was antagonised
in a dose-dependent manner by yohimbine žnon-subtype
selective a 2-adrenoceptor antagonist.,  xxxd3000xxx  ž a 2b adrenoceptor antagonist in addition to its classic action as
an a 1-adrenoceptor antagonist. and arc-239 žprefers
a 2-adrenergic receptor to a 1 more than  xxxd3000xxx . žbylund
et al., 1988..
moreover, the effect of clonidine could be inhibited not
only by blocking a 2-adrenoceptors, but also by centrally
injected opioid antagonists. naloxone, the non-selective,
moderately m-opioid receptor preferring antagonist, naltrindole, the d-opioid receptor antagonist and naltriben, the
selective d 2-opioid receptor antagonist inhibited the gastroprotective effect of clonidine, indicating that central opioid
— particularly d — receptors are involved in the mucosal
protective effect of clonidine. in our previous experiments,
it was shown that 0.5 nmolrrat of naltrindole failed to
inhibit the gastroprotective effect of morphine ž10 nmolrrat
i.c.v.. but blocked that of deltorphin ii — a selective d
receptor agonist — indicating that the dose of naltrindole
applied is really selective for d-opioid receptors. naltrindole ž5 nmolrrat i.c.v.. aggravated the  xxxd102xxx induced
lesions, which might suggest the involvement of central d
receptors in maintaining the gastric mucosal integrity. our
previous results indicated also that peripheral d-receptors
might have a role in gastric mucosal protective mechanism
žgyires et al., 1997.. the inhibitory effect of naltriben was
lower, compared to that of naltrindole. the weaker antagonist effect and the slight agonist žprotective. effect of
naltriben might be explained by its k agonist property
žstewart et al., 1994.. namely, k-opioid receptor activation
may mediate mucosal defence žgyires, 1990.. on the other
hand, it may also be speculated that central d 2-opioid
receptor subtype has only minor role in the mucosal
protective processes, therefore, the selective d 2-opioid receptor antagonist naltriben inhibited, to a lesser extent, the
gastroprotective effect of clonidine than naltrindole, which
blocks both d 1- and d 2-opioid receptors.
further evidence for the central origin of the gastroprotective action was obtained from the experiments when the
effect of centrally injected naltrindole was examined on
gastroprotection induced by orally administered clonidine.
naltrindole ž0.5 nmolrrat i.c.v.. blocked the mucosal protective effect of clonidine ž94 nmolrkg p.o.., but failed to
influence that of the d-opioid receptor agonist dadle ž32
nmolrkg s.c... dadle, if at all, passes poorly the blood
brain barrier, therefore, its gastroprotective action upon s.c.

administration is due only to peripheral mechanism. since
naltrindole injected i.c.v. failed to influence the effect of
dadle given s.c. žbut blocked that of injected i.c.v.., it
may be concluded that naltrindole in this dose has no
peripheral action at all. consequently, the gastroprotective
effect of peripherally žorally. administered clonidine is
also due to central mechanism.
in conclusion, the present data suggest that clonidine
activating central a 2 — especially a 2br2c — adrenoceptor
subtype exerts gastric mucosal protection. clonidine,
through central a 2b -adrenoceptor subtype, initiates a chain
of events, which involves — as a first step — the endogenous opioid system. experiments are in progress to elucidate the mechanismžs., which transduce the centrally initiated effect to the periphery.
