abstract
we report on the inhibitory activity of the nsaids  xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd446xxx , phenylbutazone and flunixin, on blood cyclooxygenases in
the horse using in vitro enzyme-linked assays. as expected, comparison of ic50 indicated that  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd446xxx  are more selective
inhibitors of cox-2 than phenylbutazone and flunixin;  xxxd2561xxx  was the most advantageous for horses of four nsaids examined. however
at ic80 , phenylbutazone (+134.4%) and flunixin (+29.7%) had greater cox-2 selectivity than at ic50 , and  xxxd2561xxx  (−41.2%) and  xxxd446xxx 
(−12.9%) had lower cox-2 selectivity than at ic50 . we therefore propose that the selectivity of nsaids should be assessed at the 80% as
well as 50% inhibition level.

1. introduction
since its purification in 1976, cyclooxygenase (now  xxxg1883xxx ) has been recognised as the principal enzyme catalyzing
the synthesis of prostanoids from  xxxd208xxx . about 15
years later, a gene encoding a second isoform, cox-2 was
identified.
although there are biochemical and crystal structure differences between cox-1 and cox-2, both enzymes are involved in the production of pgg2 and pgh2, which are
important intermediates in the pathways to various primary
prostanoids including pgi2 , pgf2␣ ,  xxxg1073xxx  , pge2 and txa2
[1]. the two enzymes show equal affinities for the substrates
 xxxd208xxx  and  xxxd1886xxx , however
cox-2 is more efficient than cox-1 in oxygenating eiocosapentaenoic, gamma-linolenic, alpha-linolenic and linolenic
acids [2].
the presence of the small val at position 523 in human
cox-2 facilitates inhibitor binding at the enzyme active site;
whereas inhibitor binding is hindered by the presence of the

larger ileu residue at the equivalent position in cox-1 [3].
the situation is similar in the mouse isozymes [2] but the crystal structures of cyclooxygenases from other animals have not
been determined.
there are other differences between the two isoforms:
cox-2 is located on nuclear and endoplasmic reticulum
membranes, while cox-1 is confined to the endoplasmic
reticulum membrane [4,5]; importantly also, cox-1 is constitutively expressed in nearly all cell types, while cox-2 is
induced in inflammatory conditions.
much effort has gone into developing non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) that selectively inhibit cox-2
rather than cox-1, so as not to affect the homeostasis functions of the prostanoids preferentially synthesised by cox-1,
and in particular to reduce the gastro-intestinal bleeding
caused by cox-1 inhibition [6,7]. pharmacological assays
comparing gastrointestinal damage with pain-antagonizing,
and fever- and inflammation-reducing activities were initially employed to determine nsaid selectivity. however,
such studies are time and animal consuming. they were later
substituted by in vitro inhibition studies to determine the
potency (ic50 ) and selectivity of nsaids for the two cox
isoforms.

much data has been accumulated on newly-synthesized
nsaids, but the results are often difficult to compare because
the analytical methods (ria or enzyme-linked assays) and
biological models have varied so extensively [8,9].
a recent immunoenzymatic study by cavalli et al. [10]
on circulating cox-1 and cox-2 in horses, cattle, dogs and
pigs, found major differences between these species. in particular, thromboxane availability was much lower in horses
and pigs than in dogs and cattle, while circulating pge2 availability was closely similar in the four species, following induction by bacteria lipopolysaccharide (lps).
the effects of different nsaids in horses are of particular
interest since these animals are highly subject to acute and
chronic inflammatory limb conditions. we investigated cox
inhibition in vitro by two established nsaids (phenylbutazone and flunixin) widely used to treat horses, and also by
two newer compounds,  xxxd446xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx .  xxxd2561xxx  has not previously been investigated for suitability in
horses.

2. materials and methods

2.2. substances and drugs

we used six clinically healthy saddle horses (both sexes
and various breeds) weighing 400–600 kg, that had not received any drug treatment for at least the month prior to the
study.
blood (1 ml) for plasma determinations was collected
immediately into plastic tubes. each tube contained 10 ␮g
e. coli lps, serotype 0.26:b6 to induce cox-2; 100 ␮g
 xxxd234xxx  to inhibit cox-1; 10 iu  xxxd2267xxx 
to inhibit clotting, and various concentrations of the nsaids
under study (see later). incubation at 37 ◦ c for 24 h began immediately. this was followed by centrifugation at 2000 × g
to afford the plasma. the plasma was re-centrifuged at
2000 × g and the supernatant divided into 150 ␮l aliquots,
and frozen at −20 ◦ c pending analysis. after warming to
room temperature samples were analyzed immunoenzymatically for pge2 by the method of patrignani et al. [11] using
a kit (cayman chemical co., ann arbour, michigan, usa).
preliminary assays to obtain values within 20–80% of the
pge2 standard reference curve indicated the plasma should
be diluted at 1:25 and 1:50 prior to pge2 analysis.
for the serum determinations, blood (1 ml) was collected
immediately into glass tubes containing various concentrations of the nsaids under study (see later), left at room
temperature for at least 2 h, and centrifuged at 2000 × g. following a second centrifugation at 2000 × g the supernatant
was divided into 150 ␮l aliquots and frozen at −20 ◦ c pending analysis. the samples were analysed for txb2 (stable
form of txa2 ) by immunoenzymatic kit (cayman chemical
co., ann arbour, michigan, usa) according to the method
of patrignani et al. [11].
preliminary assays to obtain values within 20–80% of the
txb2 reference curve, indicated that the serum should be
diluted 1:50, 1:100 and 1:200 prior to analysis.

phenylbutazone (injectable 20% solution), flunixin meglumine (flogen, injectable 8.3% solution) and  xxxd2561xxx 
( xxxd2561xxx  injectable 0.5% solution) were kind gifts from
intervet, italy, farmaceutici gellini, italy, and boehringer
ingelheim italia, respectively.  xxxd446xxx  ( xxxd446xxx -pfizer,
injectable 50% solution) was purchased from a pharmacy.
 xxxd2267xxx  salt and e. coli lps (serotype 0.26:b6)
were purchased from sigma chemical, usa. acetylsalicylic
acid (flectadol 1000, sanofi, italy) was purchased from a
pharmacy.
all the drugs were diluted with commercial sterile water
(italian pharmacopoeia) purchased from a pharmacy.
the concentrations of nsaids used were: phenylbutazone and  xxxd2561xxx : 10−3.5 , 10−4.5 , 10−5.5 , and 10−7 m; flunixin and  xxxd446xxx : 10−4 , 10−4.5 , 10−5.5 , and 10−7 m. the
lower initial concentrations (10−4 m) of flunixin and  xxxd446xxx  were determined following trials showing that 10−3.5 m
of these substances consistently produced haemolysis.

txb2 and pge2 concentrations were expressed as the
mean ± s.e.m. of the values obtained for each horse. txb2
was produced by cox-1 in the platelets of serum, and its concentration considered a measure of cox-1-activity. pge2 in
plasma was produced by cox-2 following lps induction
and cox-1 inactivation by aspirin; pge2 concentration was
therefore a measure of cox-2 activity. the effects of the
nsaids on txb2 and pge2 concentrations (as measures
of cox-1 and cox-2 activity, respectively) were expressed
as percentages of baseline txb2 or pge2 levels determined
in tubes with no nsaid added. the concentration-response
curves and concentrations producing 50% (ic50 ) and 80%
(ic80 ) inhibition for each nsaid were obtained by using
prism 3.0 software (graphpad, san diego, california, usa).
selectivity at 50% and 80% inhibition was also calculated as
ic cox-1/ic cox-2.
an intra-assay coefficient of variability (cv) was moreover calculated for evaluating the accuracy of data.

3. results
the mean baseline level of txb2 in horse serum was
7.24 ± 1.10 ng ml−1 . the mean level of pge2 in plasma with
 xxxd234xxx  added to inhibit cox-1, and lps added to
induce cox-2, was 3.26 ± 0.47 ng ml−1 . the cv values calculated for measuring intra-assay variability resulted about
16 and 14% for txb2 and pge2 , respectively.
the effects of increasing concentrations of phenylbutazone, flunixin,  xxxd446xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  on txb2 production by cox-1, and pge2 production by cox-2, are shown
in fig. 1. from these curves it is evident that flunixin exerts
greater anti-cox-1 activity than the other nsaids and that,

at the three lower concentrations, phenylbutazone has less
anti-cox-2 activity than the other nsaids tested. further
inspection of the two figures indicates that the slopes of the
inhibition curves differ. the slopes of the curves are shown

cox-1 versus cox-2 selectivity for each nsaid as measured by ic50 cox-1/ic50 cox-2.
from differences in the slopes of the inhibition curves, the
data were extrapolated to estimate concentrations producing
80% inhibition (ic80 ). these values are shown in table 2

4. discussion
the txb2 serum concentration (7.24 ± 1.10 ng ml−1 ) as
measure of cox-1 activity, and pge2 plasma concentration
(3.26 ± 0.47 ng ml−1 ) as measure of cox-2 activity were of
the same order of magnitude as those (3.77 ± 0.47 ng ml−1
and 1.92 ± 0.51 ng ml−1 , respectively) obtained using the
same immunoenzymatic methods in our recent study [10].
the small differences may be due to difference in the breeds
and ages of the animals examined in the two studies.
from the ic50 values of the four nsaids tested, flunixin had the strongest anti-cox-1 activity (10−7.2 m) while
 xxxd2561xxx  had the strongest anti-cox-2 activity (10−6.1 m).
these findings are in accord with current opinion which considers phenylbutazone and flunixin to be more selective inhibitors of cox-1 than cox-2, and  xxxd446xxx  and especially
 xxxd2561xxx  to be more selective inhibitors of cox-2 than
cox-1. our values for phenylbutazone and flunixin selectivity support these opinions.
the ic50 of phenylbutazone compared with flunixin indicate that the former is a less potent inhibitor of cox-1,
suggesting it may have less adverse gastrointestinal effects
when used in therapy. of the newer nsaids,  xxxd2561xxx 
showed greater selectivity for cox-2 than  xxxd446xxx . based
on these considerations,  xxxd2561xxx  seems the best of the
tested nsaids for horse administration, in agreement with
the report of kleeman and friton [12].
examination of ic80 values of the four nsaids
tested showed that phenylbutazone (+134.4%) and flunixin
(+29.7%) had greater selectivity for cox-2 than at the 50%
inhibitory concentration, while  xxxd2561xxx  (−41.2%) and
 xxxd446xxx  (−12.9%) had lower cox-2 selectivity than at the
50% inhibitory concentration. these findings are attributable
to differences between the drugs in terms of the slopes of their
inhibition curves in horse blood. the ic80 values of these
drugs therefore seem more suitable for nsaids evaluation
than ic50 values, particularly since warner et al. [13] have
presented data suggesting that a valid antiinflammatory effect
is obtained when cox-2 activity is 80% inhibited. however
the same authors, who studied  xxxd2561xxx  for human use,
found that 80% inhibition of cox-2 activity in vitro involved
25% inhibition of cox-1.
when the four nsaids we studied were examined for
cox-1 inhibition at concentrations producing 80% cox-2
inhibition, we found that cox-1 inhibition was 70.97% for
 xxxd2561xxx , 72.58% for  xxxd446xxx , 79.59% for phenylbutazone and 83.81% for flunixin. from these calculated data it
is evident that, in the horse  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd446xxx  have
the most favourable selectivity profiles of the four nsaids
studied. nevertheless our findings indicate that all these drugs
have narrow safety margins and hence the potential for untoward effects in horses.
to conclude, the results obtained in the present study indicate that  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd446xxx  are more selective cox-2
inhibitors than phenylbutazone and flunixin in horses and furthermore that  xxxd2561xxx  retains this selectivity best at higher

305

concentrations. we emphasise that, when using in vitro enzymatic assays to predict beneficial and harmful effects of
nsaids, it is important to analyse the slopes of the cox
inhibition curves in each target species to thereby improve
the utility of this simple and convenient screening method.
it is important to note also, that compounds that are highly
selective cox-2 inhibitors in one species may not necessarily
exert the same selectivity in other species [8,9]. the recent
finding in humans that highly selective cox-2 inhibitors may
be associated with severe liver and cardiovascular side effects
[14,15,16], probably in relation to highly reduced anti- xxxg1883xxx  activity, should also be borne in mind. clearly nsaids that
are highly selective for anti-cox-2 require more extensive
study, not only to determine whether their potentially severe
side effects are a necessary concomitant of their inability to
inhibit cox-1, but also to determine their real utility as anticancer agents [17,18].
