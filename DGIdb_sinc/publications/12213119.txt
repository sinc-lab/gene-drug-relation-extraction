phenylbutazone (pbz) was administered to six calves intravenously (i.v.) and
orally at a dose rate of 4.4 mg ⁄ kg in a three-period cross-over study
incorporating a placebo treatment to establish its pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic properties. extravascular distribution was determined by
measuring penetration into tissue chamber fluid in the absence of stimulation
(transudate) and after stimulation of chamber tissue with the mild irritant
carrageenan (exudate). pbz pharmacokinetics after i.v. dosage was characterized by slow clearance (1.29 ml ⁄ kg ⁄ h), long-terminal half-life (53.4 h), low
distribution volume (0.09 l ⁄ kg) and low concentrations in plasma of the
metabolite  xxxd2815xxx  (opbz), confirming previously published data for
adult cattle. after oral dosage bioavailability (f) was 66%. passage into exudate
was slow and limited, and penetration into transudate was even slower and
more limited; area under curve values for plasma, exudate and transudate after
i.v. dosage were 3604, 1117 and 766 lg h ⁄ ml and corresponding values after
oral dosage were 2435, 647 and 486 lg h ⁄ ml. these concentrations were
approximately 15–20 (plasma) and nine (exudate) times greater than those
previously reported in horses (receiving the same dose rate of pbz). in the
horse, the lower concentrations had produced marked inhibition of eicosanoid
synthesis and suppressed the inflammatory response. the higher concentrations in calves were insufficient to inhibit significantly exudate  xxxd1903xxx 
(pge2), leukotriene b4 (ltb4) and b-glucuronidase concentrations and exudate
leucocyte numbers, serum thromboxane b2 (txb2), and bradykinin-induced
skin swelling. these differences from the horse might be the result of: (a) the
presence in equine biological fluids of higher concentrations than in calves of
the active pbz metabolite, opbz; (b) a greater degree of binding of pbz to
plasma protein in calves; (c) species differences in the sensitivity to pbz of the
cyclo-oxygenase (cox) isoenzymes, cox-1 and cox-2 or; (d) a combination of
these factors. to achieve clinical efficacy with single doses of pbz in calves,
higher dosages than 4.4 mg ⁄ kg will be probably required.

introduction
phenylbutazone (pbz) has been used in veterinary medicine for
more than 50 years and for some 30 years it was the drug of
choice as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent in companion and farm animal medicine. although several other drugs of
the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (nsaid) class are now
licensed for veterinary use, pbz has a similar mechanism of
action to the newer agents and it retains considerable popularity.
it is particularly valuable in circumstances where lack of
availability or the expense of newer nsaids preclude or limit
their use. on the other hand, rare but potentially fatal toxicity
problems have led to discontinuance of use of pbz in human
 2002 blackwell science ltd

medicine. consequently, setting residue limits in edible tissues of
food producing species might be difficult.
there have been several pharmacokinetic studies on pbz in
adult cattle and these have indicated, compared with other
major veterinary species like the dog and horse, that clearance is
slow and terminal half-life is long (eberhardson et al., 1979; de
backer et al., 1980; toutain et al., 1980a; martin et al., 1984;
lees et al., 1988; williams et al., 1990a, b; de veau et al., 1998,
2002). therefore pbz has the potential advantage over some
nsaids used in cattle ( xxxd2423xxx , flunixin), recommended for
administration once daily for 3 or 5 days, respectively, of
achieving efficacy with single dosage. other drugs of this class
( xxxd2561xxx ,  xxxd446xxx ) do have slower clearance and are
299

recommended for administration as a single dose (delatour et al.,
1996; lees et al., 1996) but no available drug is likely to have a
longer duration of action than pbz. whilst slow clearance and
long duration of action could have advantages for efficacy in
some clinical circumstances, they might be disadvantageous
from a residue perspective. in fact, this will not necessarily be a
major problem, because toutain et al. (1980a) at slaughter
times ranging from 11 to 18 days reported mean pbz concentrations in plasma of 1.97 lg ⁄ ml, liver concentrations of
0.26 lg ⁄ ml and concentrations in muscle of 0.11 lg ⁄ ml.
therefore, tissue residues decline in parallel with plasma
concentration but tissue concentrations are significantly less.
similar residue data for muscle were obtained in the rabbit, but
higher concentrations were obtained in liver and kidney
(toutain et al., 1980b). however, the relationship between
concentration in tissues and withdrawal period is indirect and
is determined by the no observable effect level of the drug.
the pharmacokinetics of pbz has been reported in neonatal
calves, (samrad et al., 1993) in which elimination half-life was
207 h but there are no reports in older calves. it cannot be
assumed that all pharmacokinetic properties will be similar to
those in adult cattle, as age related differences in nsaid
pharmacokinetics have been reported for pbz in the goat (eltom
et al., 1993) and  xxxd446xxx  in calves (delatour et al., 1996; lees
et al., 1996). moreover, there are no reports on the pharmacodynamics of pbz in either young or adult cattle, and dosage
schedules cannot be proposed in the absence of such data. the
aim of this study therefore was to obtain simultaneous
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data in a single group
of calves using models of acute inflammation developed in this
laboratory. the objectives of the study were to (a) establish the
pharmacokinetics of pbz administered intravenously (i.v.) in
calves at a dosage of 4.4 mg ⁄ kg (this is the daily dose
recommended for the horse and slightly less than the dose
recommended for the dog and cat); (b) determine the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of pbz at the same dose rate after oral
administration in calves; (c) establish plasma concentration–
time relationships for the metabolite of pbz,  xxxd2815xxx 
(opbz); (d) establish pharmacodynamic effects of i.v. and oral
pbz on biochemical pathways which might explain the mechanism of its therapeutic effects at the molecular level; and (e)
integrate the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data to
determine the potency of pbz on cyclo-oxygenase (cox) and
other biochemical pathways. this information may provide a
scientific basis for selecting an optimal dosage schedule for
clinical use.
like other nsaids, the principal and possibly sole mechanism
of action of pbz is believed to be inhibition of cox (higgins et al.,
1984a; lees & higgins, 1985, 1986; lees et al., 1987a, b).
cyclo-oxygenase exists in two isoforms, cox-1 and cox-2 (fu
et al., 1990; kujuba et al., 1991; xie et al., 1996). the former is
responsible for the synthesis of thromboxane (tx)b2, a constitutive enzyme concerned primarily with what have been
described as ôhousekeeping rolesõ. for example, it is concerned
with gastro- and reno-protection and is a pro-aggregatory and
vasoconstrictor agent, released in large amounts when blood

clots (vane & botting, 1995; vane et al., 1998). cox-2 on the
other hand is not present constitutively in most cells but is
induced at sites of acute inflammation, where it plays a crucial
role in the de novo synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as
prostaglandin (pg)e2 and pgi2 (mitchell et al., 1995; bakhle &
botting, 1996; nantel et al., 1999; katori & majima, 2000).
these prostanoids interact synergistically with other mediators,
including histamine and bradykinin, to cause sensitization of
nociceptors and vasodilation leading to hyperalgesia and oedema
(arising from increased vascular permeability to plasma protein),
respectively. recent studies have suggested possible roles for
cox-1 derived prostaglandins, as well as those produced by
cox-2, in acute inflammation (smith et al., 1998; wallace,
1999; wallace et al., 1999; crofford et al., 2000). in this study
the magnitude and time course of blockade of cox-1 was
measured by the inhibition of serum txb2 synthesis ex vivo. the
blockade of cox-2 was measured in vivo in a tissue chamber
model of acute inflammation by following the time course of
synthesis of pge2.
there is abundant evidence of a role for cox-2 in acute
inflammation and it is likely that pge2 in exudate in this study
was attributable mainly and possibly solely to cox-2 induction,
but some contribution from cox-1 cannot be excluded. there
are no published data to indicate whether pbz inhibits other
enzymes (namely lipoxygenases) which like cox use arachidonic
acid as substrate. possible inhibition of  xxxg147xxx  by pbz
was determined by in vivo measurement of leukotriene (lt)b4 in
inflammatory exudate.

materials and methods
experimental design
a three-period cross-over study using a latin square design,
such that each calf received pbz at a dose rate of 4.4 mg ⁄ kg i.v.
and orally and i.v. placebo treatment, was undertaken in six
healthy male calves of the friesian cross breed. they were aged
4–5 months and weighed 77–105 kg. two week intervals were
allowed between each period of the cross-over. hay and water
were available ad libitum and nuts were provided twice daily.
in period 1, two calves were given 4.4 mg ⁄ kg pbz ( xxxd2919xxx  injection, arnolds veterinary products, romford, essex,
uk) into the right jugular vein (over 10–15 sec) and two calves
received 4.4 mg ⁄ kg pbz ( xxxd2919xxx  powder, arnolds veterinary products) orally as a drench, placed on the back of the
tongue. two further calves received an equivalent volume of
normal saline (placebo) i.v. in periods 2 and 3, treatments were
altered so that each animal received each treatment in
sequence.
also at time 0, in each period of the cross-over, each calf was
given an intracaveal injection of a sterile carrageenan solution
(vide infra). this tissue chamber was used to harvest inflammatory exudate. a noninjected chamber was used to collect normal
chamber fluid (transudate). in periods 2 and 3, the site of i.v.
injection (right or left jugular vein) was alternated and cages not

used in the previous periods to harvest exudate were used to
collect exudate.
tissue chamber insertion and generation of exudate
tissue chambers, four per animal, two on each side of the flank
in the mid-flank region, approximately 15–20 cm from the
spinal column mid-line, were inserted subcutaneously under
deep xylazine (rompun 2% solution, bayer, bury st edmunds,
suffolk, uk) sedation and lidocaine ( xxxd2482xxx  and adrenaline
solution, norbrook laboratories ltd, newry, north ireland, uk)
local anaesthesia. polypropylene multiperforated tissue chambers with a diameter of 41 mm and internal volume of 36 ml
with 25 holes, each of 0.5 mm diameter, were used (higgins
et al., 1984a, 1987). to permit wound healing and the growth
of granulation tissue into the chambers, a period of 5 weeks was
allowed between insertion and the start of experimentation.
after intracaveal injection of the mild irritant lambda
carrageenan (0.5 ml of sterile 1% w ⁄ v solution, marine colloids,
springfield, missouri, usa) the granulation tissue which occupies approximately one-third of the chamber volume undergoes
an acute inflammatory response. exudate was collected from
carrageenan injected chambers and normal chamber fluid
(transudate) was collected from noninjected chambers. tissue
chamber fluid is in continuity with interstitial fluid and may be
regarded as a deep peripheral compartment (clarke, 1989;
clarke et al., 1989).
sampling and measuring procedures
samples of blood for determination of plasma concentrations of
pbz and opbz (10 ml in li-heparin monovettes) were collected
from a jugular vein before and at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 min
and 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h
after drug or placebo administration. further blood samples
(5 ml) were collected in edta monovettes for the measurement
of leucocyte counts at exudate sampling times (see below). blood
samples (2.5 ml) for ex vivo measurement of serum thromboxane (tx)b2 production (in blood allowed to clot in glass tubes at
37 c for 60 min) were withdrawn before ()30 min) and at 1, 2,
4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h after pbz and
placebo administration.
exudate and transudate samples (1.5 ml) were harvested 1,
3, 6, 9, 12, 24, 30, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h after dosage.
samples were collected into tubes containing 10 lg bw540c
(wellcome foundation, beckenham, kent, uk) to prevent
artefactual generation of eicosanoids in vitro between collection
and analysis. samples were centrifuged to remove leucocytes,
aliquoted and then stored at )20 c prior to measurement
of concentrations of pbz, pge2, ltb4 and b-glucuronidase.
a 0.1-ml aliquot was used prior to centrifugation for determination of total leucocyte count. skin temperature over the
exudate tissue cages was monitored prior to carrageenan
injection and at all exudate sampling times using an horiba
it-330 infra-red thermometer (horiba instruments ltd, brackmills, northamptonshire, uk).
 2002 blackwell science ltd, j. vet. pharmacol. therap. 25, 299–309

the antibradykinin effect of pbz was determined by making
intradermal injections of bradykinin (0.1 ml of 10 lg ⁄ ml
solution) into areas of clipped and shaved skin in the neck
before and at 2, 7, 25, 49 and 97 h after drug or placebo
administration. thirty minutes after each injection two perpendicular wheal diameters and skinfold thickness were measured
using vernier and spring gauge calipers, respectively. from these
readings wheal volume was determined as half an ellipsoid from
the formula: v ¼ (2 ⁄ 3) p r1 r2 r3, where v ¼ wheal volume (ll),
p is 3.142, r1 ¼ horizontal radius, r2 ¼ vertical radius and
r3 ¼ depth of wheal.
analytical methods
concentrations of pbz and opbz in plasma, exudate and
transudate were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (hplc) using the method of lees et al. (1986) with
modifications. a range of spiked plasma concentrations was
prepared from a stock solution of 1000 lg ⁄ ml pbz or opbz in
methanol. the stock solution was further diluted in plasma to
produce serial concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 100 lg ⁄ ml
as assay standards. briefly, each sample (1.0 ml) was mixed
with citrate ⁄ phosphate buffer and chloroform was added as the
extraction solvent containing hexoestrol as internal standard
(sigma, poole, dorset, uk). the sample was mixed for 20 min
and then centrifuged. the organic phase was evaporated at
50 c under a stream of nitrogen to a residual volume of 0.5 ml,
then dissolved in methanol. the chromatography conditions
were as follows: flow rate ¼ 1 ml ⁄ min, ultraviolet detection
wavelength ¼ 240 nm, sensitivity ¼ 0.1 absorbance units full
scale sensitivity (aufs), injection volume ¼ 30 ll and time
run ¼ 18 min. the mobile phase was acetonitrile (500 ml),
water (500 ml) and 1.3% perchloric acid (0.5 ml). the elution
times were approximately 7, 10 and 17 min for the internal
standard, opbz and pbz, respectively. the hplc system
comprised a system controller (waters 600e, milford, ma,
usa), tunable absorbance detector (waters 484), shimadzu
autoinjector and system controller (scl-6 a, kyoto, japan) and
an integrator (waters 746). the precolumn and column used
were lichrospher rpc18 5 lm and lichrosorb rpc18 7 lm
(250 · 4 mm), respectively.
serum txb2 and exudate pge2 concentrations were measured
by radioimmunoassay (higgins & lees, 1984; higgins et al.,
1984a). for each assay, samples were diluted at least 1:5 in
radioimmunoassay (ria) buffer and standard curves were
prepared using eicosanoid free serum and exudate obtained
from calves treated with i.v. flunixin (4.4 mg ⁄ kg) (schering
plough animal health, welwyn garden city, hertfordshire, uk)
followed by charcoal stripping of the generated fluids. leukotriene b4 concentration in exudate was measured following solid
phase extraction using a commercial kit (amersham international plc, amersham, buckinghamshire, uk). b-glucuronidase
activity was measured by a spectrophotometric technique
(fishman, 1974). leucocyte counts in exudate, transudate and
blood were measured using a coulter counter on 0.1 ml
volumes (coulter electronics ltd, luton, bedfordshire, uk).

pharmacokinetic analyses
plasma concentration–time data for individual calves were analysed using pc nonlin compartmental programs by nonlinear
least squares regression analysis (sci sofware, statistical consultants inc, lexington, ky, usa). minimum akaike information
criteria estimates were applied to discriminate the best fitting
model and improved fit of data was achieved by re-weighting. in
every instance, the data fitted the bicompartmental model
equation, cp ¼ a e–at + b e–bt, after i.v. pbz administration.
pharmacokinetic terms are defined in tables of data. bioavailability after oral dosage was determined from the formula:
f ¼ ðaucoral  dosei:v:  t1=2 bi:v: þ=ðauci:v:  doseoral  t1=2 boral þ

statistical analysis
the significance of differences for pharmacodynamic variables
between drug-treated and placebo-treated calves was assessed
using analysis of variance and, where significant differences
were established, fisher’s multicomparisons test (two tailed test)
was used. differences were accepted as significant for p < 0.05.

results
pharmacokinetics
phenylbutazone concentrations in plasma, exudate and transudate between 1 and 120 h after administration are illustrated in
fig. 1 (i.v. dosage) and fig. 2 (oral dosage). at all sampling times
up to 120 h and with both administration routes pbz concentration was highest in plasma and lowest in transudate. these
differences are reflected in mean auc values of 3604, 1117 and
766 lg h ⁄ ml (i.v. dosage) and 2435, 647 and 486 lg h ⁄ ml

(oral dosage) for plasma, exudate and transudate, respectively
(tables 1 and 2). in all calves, plasma concentration–time data
fitted a bicompartmental model after i.v. administration, with
fairly rapid distribution (t½a ¼ 0.69 h) and slow elimination
(t½b ¼ 53.4 h) (table 1). clearance was very slow
(1.29 ml ⁄ kg ⁄ h) and vc and vdss were both very low, 0.07 and
0.09 l ⁄ kg, respectively. the low values for vc and vdss suggest
limited distribution from the vascular compartment, as plasma
volume is of the order of 0.05 l ⁄ kg. the ratio k12:k21 was 0.4,
indicating faster transfer from the peripheral to central compartment than vice versa.
after oral dosage of pbz the plasma concentration–time data
fitted a monocompartmental model with an absorption lag
phase. absorption was slow, as indicated by the mean t½abs of
2.40 h and tmax of 11.7 h. tlag was 0.30 h. mean bioavailability
was 66%, ranging from 47 to 91%. terminal half-life (57.9 h)
was similar to that after i.v. dosage.
phenylbutazone penetration into exudate was slow and
limited. thus, after i.v. dosage the concentration was only
2.26 lg ⁄ ml at 6 h and the cmax of 18.4 lg ⁄ ml was obtained at
23 h. penetration into transudate was even slower and more
limited; the 6 h concentration was only 0.59 lg ⁄ ml and tmax
was 35.0 h, when the concentration was 11.7 lg ⁄ ml (table 2).
after oral dosage penetration into chamber fluids was again slow
and the exudate and transudate concentrations were reduced
approximately in direct proportion to the oral bioavailability of
66%. thus, cmax values were 9.9 and 8.3 lg ⁄ ml for exudate
and transudate, respectively, and corresponding tmax values
were 54 and 55 h (table 2).
 xxxd2815xxx  concentrations in plasma were below the
loq of 0.05 lg ⁄ ml in all samples of five calves and the
metabolite was present in plasma in low concentrations at two
sampling times and in exudate at three times in a single animal
after i.v. dosage. after oral dosage, opbz was present in plasma
at a single time in a single animal but present in exudate at two
sampling times in two calves and five sampling times in one calf.

in transudate opbz was present in low concentration at a single
sampling time in two calves after both i.v. and oral dosage.
pharmacodynamics
with placebo administration there was some random variation
in serum txb2 concentration at the 14 sampling times. mean
values ranged from 116 to 151 ng ⁄ ml. after i.v. pbz dosage,
concentrations of txb2 were less at all sampling times than in
the placebo group (fig. 3). however, reductions were generally
small (of the order of 20–30%), not related to time after dosage
and not statistically significant. moreover, the control (zero time)
value was 7% lower before pbz than prior to placebo dosage, so
that there was no evidence for an effect of pbz on txb2
synthesis. similarly, after oral administration of pbz there was
no significant difference from placebo treatment at any time
(fig. 3).
the time course of pge2 synthesis in inflammatory exudate is
illustrated in fig. 4; the peak concentration was 23.5 ng ⁄ ml at
24 h, compared with concentrations of 0.8 and 2.0 ng ⁄ ml at 1
and 120 h, respectively. the large sem values were primarily

because of high pge2 concentrations (outlier values) in a single
animal, particularly between 9 and 36 h. pbz administered i.v.
produced a numerical reduction in mean pge2 concentration at
11 of 12 sampling times. however, differences were not
statistically significant, because the reductions were inconsistent.
in individual animals, compared with placebo administration,
there was no apparent inhibition of pge2 synthesis in two
animals, moderate apparent inhibition (approximately 50%) in

skin temperature rise was monitored over carrageenaninjected tissue chambers at all exudate sampling times. there
were no significant differences in skin temperature rise after i.v.
and oral pbz dosage compared with placebo administration
(data not shown).
intradermal injections of bradykinin produced measurable
wheals at times of 2.5, 7.5, 25.5, 49.5 and 97.5 h. after placebo
treatment mean volumes ranged from 450 to 600 ll. there was
a tendency towards reduction in wheal volume after i.v. pbz
administration, but the differences from placebo were small (in
the range of 8–25%) and statistically nonsignificant. wheal
volumes were not affected by oral pbz administration (data not
shown).
leucocyte numbers in whole blood, exudate and transudate
were not significantly affected by either i.v. or oral pbz
administration, in comparison with placebo administration (data
not shown).

statistically significant reduction in pge2 concentration after

concentrations of ltb4 in exudate were relatively constant
between 1 and 120 h and this eicosanoid was not affected
by pbz administered i.v. (fig. 5). exudate concentrations of
b-glucuronidase were also unaffected by pbz administration

discussion
phenylbutazone pharmacokinetics has been reported in a range
of ruminant species, including the cow, sheep, goat and camel.
mean data from these studies are presented in table 3, which
demonstrates that there are significant species differences but
generally similarities within each species in reported data. thus,
in all species volume of distribution is very low, indicating
limited distribution beyond the vascular compartment and well
perfused tissues. for example, in both the calf (this study) and
adult male and female cattle, vd ranged from 80 to 140 ml ⁄ kg,
which is only twice the assumed plasma volume of approximately 50 ml ⁄ kg. similar data were reported for other ruminant species. the limited extravascular distribution is believed to
be caused by the very high level of protein binding which, at
plasma concentrations achieved with 4.4, 6.0 mg ⁄ kg pbz, is
greater than 99.5% (lees et al., 1988; de veau et al., 1998,
2000). only for at most a short period after i.v. dosage does the
free plasma concentration increase to at most 1.0% of total pbz
concentration (martin et al., 1984; lees et al., 1988). the former
authors reported 99.0% protein binding at a pbz concentration
in plasma of 100 lg ⁄ ml and 99.5% binding at a pbz
concentration of 50 lg ⁄ ml.
phenylbutazone clearance is low in all ruminants but with
some species differences, so that for example in the sheep, goat
and camel values were higher than in calves and adult cattle.
for calves and adult cattle mean values ranged from 1.24 to
2.90 ml ⁄ kg ⁄ h. there were, however, some within species
differences in clearance in both the goat and camel, when results
from different laboratories are compared (table 3). moreover,
the data of eltom et al. (1993) illustrate the marked effect of age
on pbz clearance in goats; in animals aged 1 day, 10 days,
4 weeks, 6 weeks and in adults mean values were 2, 4, 4, 6, and
13 ml ⁄ kg ⁄ h, respectively. similar data for calves were reported
by semrad et al. (1993). on the other hand, there were no such
differences in clearance, or indeed, vdss and t½b in the male
calves aged 4–5 months in this study in comparison with

adult male and female cattle (table 3). values of auc, when
adjusted for dose, were similar in cattle in several studies, except
for possibly somewhat higher auc values in calves (this study)
compared with adult cattle.
concentrations of opbz in all three fluids collected from calves
were very low or undetectable at all sampling times. this
indicates that (a) although it is a biologically active metabolite,
the concentrations will be too low for it to contribute significantly to biological activity; and (b) it is unlikely to be formed in
large amounts by first pass metabolism following oral administration. however, the data do not necessarily indicate that very
limited oxidative metabolism of pbz occurs. studies in our
laboratory (in adult cattle) have shown that plasma opbz
concentrations are low (cmax ¼ 0.4 lg ⁄ ml after i.v. dosage of
4.4 mg ⁄ kg), but urine:plasma concentration ratios as high as
301 were recorded. corresponding ratios for pbz were no higher
than 0.39 (lees et al., 1988).
data from several studies in our and other laboratories
indicate that pbz pharmacokinetics in the horse is very
 2002 blackwell science ltd, j. vet. pharmacol. therap. 25, 299–309

different to that in ruminants in general and in cattle in
particular. although vdss and vd b are low, reported values
(141–165 ml ⁄ kg, lees & higgins, 1985; lees et al., 1987a, b;
maitho et al., 1986) are approximately twice as high in the horse
as in cattle. plasma protein binding in the horse, as in the cow,
exceeds 99% at plasma concentrations achieved with therapeutic dose rates. however, clearance is greater in the horse
(17.9–26.1 ml ⁄ kg ⁄ h, maitho et al., 1986; lees et al., 1987a, b).
in this study clearance in calves was only 1.29 ml ⁄ kg ⁄ h. in
consequence, elimination half-life is much shorter in horses,
being at least 10 times less (t½b ¼ 4.5–5.46 h) than in cattle
(lees et al., 1986, 1987a, 1988; maitho et al., 1986). hence,
plasma auc values for total drug concentration are of the order
of 15–20 times greater in cattle than in horses for a dosage rate
of 4.4 mg ⁄ kg. this applies after both oral and i.v. dosage,
because in both the horse and cattle bioavailability is of the order
of 60–70% (maitho et al., 1986; lees et al., 1987a, 1988).
moreover, in the present study pbz auc values in inflammatory
exudate in calves (mean ¼ 1117 lg h ⁄ ml) were approximately

306 a. k. arifah & p. lees

nine times greater than in the horse (mean ¼ 128 lg h ⁄ ml)
after i.v. dosage of 4.4 mg ⁄ kg pbz, using tissue cages of the same
dimensions and generating exudate by identical means in both
studies (lees et al., 1986).
in view of the much greater plasma and exudate concentrations of pbz in cattle, it might have been anticipated that, in the
tissue chamber model of acute inflammation, pbz would exert
marked anti-inflammatory properties, as indicated indirectly by
inhibition of synthesis of pge2. similarly, a greater degree of
inhibition of serum txb2 might be expected in cattle compared
with horses. this was not so. indeed, neither exudate pge2 nor
serum txb2 was inhibited significantly by pbz administered
orally or i.v. thus, the pharmacodynamic changes reported in
this study were, from both statistical and biological significance
perspectives, negative. as well as the lack of effect on serum
txb2 and exudate pge2, reflecting the lack of or minimal
inhibition of cox-1 and cox-2, there were no changes in
exudate ltb4 concentration (the inflammatory mediator produced by  xxxg147xxx ) and b-glucuronidase activity (an
enzyme which may be concerned with acute inflammatory
changes and tissue remodelling) in inflammatory exudate.
moreover, the small numerical decreases in bradykinin-induced
swelling produced by i.v. (but not oral) pbz were small and
statistically nonsignificant. pbz also failed to alter a cardinal sign
of inflammation, heat, as indicated by skin temperature rise over
exudate tissue chambers. in addition, there was no significant
effect on leucocyte emigration into inflammatory exudate. the
lack of responses for some of these variables is not wholly
unexpected. thus, in our experience using tissue chamber and
polyester sponge carrageenan models of inflammation in calves
and horses, even at dose rates producing marked inhibition of
cox-1 and cox-2, most nsaids do not inhibit leucocyte
emigration or reduce exudate ltb4 concentration (landoni &
lees, 1995; landoni et al., 1995a, b, 1996; lees et al., 1996).
on the other hand, those nsaids (flunixin,  xxxd2423xxx  and
tolfenamic acid) which do produce significant inhibition of serum
txb2 and exudate pge2 in calves also suppress bradykinininduced skin swelling (landoni et al., 1995a, b, 1996). this is
not unexpected, since bradykinin may induce swelling partly
through prostaglandin related pathways.
the absence of significant reductions in exudate pge2 in
vivo and serum txb2 ex vivo are particularly noteworthy,
because it is likely that doses of nsaids must be high enough
to almost completely abolish pge2 synthesis to be clinically
effective in reducing the pain and swelling of the acute
inflammatory response. thus, in the horse, in contrast to the
present findings in the calf, both i.v. and oral pbz at the
4.4 mg ⁄ kg dose rate produced marked inhibition of exudate
txb2, pge2 and pgi2 synthesis (higgins et al., 1984b). in a
further study these authors demonstrated that in the horse,
between 4 and 24 h after a 10-day treatment schedule of oral
pbz terminating with 3.3 mg ⁄ kg on the final day, drug
concentration in exudate ranged from 2.73 to 8.12 lg ⁄ ml
and corresponding plasma concentrations were 1.8–9.0 lg ⁄ ml
(lees & higgins, 1986). these sufficed to markedly reduce the
rise in skin temperature at the site of inflammation but

without altering the influx of leucocytes. in a previous study
plasma pbz concentrations of 2.3–9.7 lg ⁄ ml and exudate
concentrations of 4.1–5.9 lg ⁄ ml reduced pge2 synthesis in
exudate by 88% (higgins et al., 1984b). moreover, pbz was
clinically effective (at 4.4 mg ⁄ kg i.v.) in reducing swelling,
decreasing skin temperature rise and increasing stride length
in horses with arthritis induced by freund’s adjuvant (toutain
et al., 1994). indeed, the latter group reported ic50 values of
3.6 and 4.3 lg ⁄ ml for inhibition by pbz of effect on stride
length and carpal skin temperature, thus extending the
findings of lees and higgins (1986).
the studies of landoni and lees (1995) in the horse revealed
that for another nsaid, flunixin, ic50 values for inhibition of
serum txb2 and exudate pge2 in the horse were 0.035 and
0.019 lg ⁄ ml, respectively, whereas in an adjuvant arthritis
model toutain et al. (1994) obtained ic50 values for stride length
and carpal skin temperature of 0.93 and 0.80 lg ⁄ ml, respectively. combining data from these two studies, ratios of
inhibition of stride length:pge2 and skin temperature:pge2 were
49 and 42, respectively. therefore, it is clear that near complete
inhibition of pge2 synthesis is required to achieve a useful
clinical response for flunixin and this is also likely to apply to
pbz, as both drugs are thought to act by similar mechanisms.
differences between oedema inhibition and blockade of
leucocyte infiltration into inflammatory exudate on the one
hand, and inhibition of synthesis of pge2 at a site of inflammation on the other, are further illustrated by the early studies of
higgs et al. (1976, 1981). in carrageenan-induced inflammation
in the rat, the dose of pbz producing 50% inhibition of oedema
produced > 95% inhibition of pge2 and ed50 values for
inhibition of leucocyte migration and inhibition of pge2
synthesis were 52.0 and 2.8 mg ⁄ kg, respectively. more recently,
warner et al. (1999) have recommended that plasma concentrations of nsaids which produce 80% inhibition of cox-2
should be achieved for therapeutic purposes.
the question arises as why pbz total concentrations (as
indicated by auc) in plasma and exudate of calves 20 and nine
times greater, respectively, than those producing both marked
inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis in serum and exudate and
suppression of clinical responses in horses should fail, in calves,
to significantly alter pge2 synthesis and other pharmacodynamic
markers. a partial explanation might be that the difference in
free pbz concentrations could be narrower than the difference in
total concentrations. however, in both species free concentrations in plasma are less than 1% of total concentration.
secondly, measurable concentrations of opbz are present in
biological fluids in the horse but not in the calf. this metabolite
could contribute to biological effects, particularly if the protein
binding of opbz is less than that of pbz. thirdly, equine ⁄ bovine
differences might be the result of species differences in cox-1 and
cox-2 isoenzymes. the ic50 for inhibition of calf cox-1 and
cox-2 may be higher than in the horse. the possibility of species
differences in ic50 values for nsaids is illustrated by the findings
of galbraith and mckellar (1996). they measured inhibition of
serum txb2 in vitro in clotting blood from dogs, goats and horses
by flunixin and meclofenamic acid. ic50 values for flunixin were

phenylbutazone in calves 307

0.10, 0.02 and 0.04 lm, respectively. corresponding values for
nonprotein bound flunixin were 0.008, 0.003 and 0.005 lm.
for meclofenamic acid only moderate species differences were
obtained for total drug (0.77, 0.80 and 0.30 lm) but ic50 values
corrected for protein binding were 0.075, 0.122 and 0.001 lm
in dogs, goats and horses, respectively, indicating a more than
100-fold difference between dogs and horses.
using whole blood assays to measure inhibition of cox-1 and
cox-2, brideau et al. (2001) reported for pbz ic50 cox-1:cox-2
ratios of 1.6 and 0.6 for the horse and dog, respectively. however,
of greater interest in the present context than the ratios are actual
ic50 values for pbz. in the horse and dog ic50 values for cox-1
were 6.2 and 17.8 lm, respectively, whilst corresponding values
for cox-2 were 3.8 and 27.6 lm, thus indicating the likelihood of
species differences, with equine enzymes being 2.9 (cox-1) and
7.2 (cox-2) times more susceptible to inhibition than canine
enzymes. similar or even greater differences between equine and
bovine cox-1 and cox-2 might explain the present findings.
however, it is necessary to exercise caution in considering ic50
differences derived from in vitro assays. large interlaboratory
differences arise. for example, ricketts et al. (1998) reported an
ic50 value of 3.8 lm for pbz against canine cox-2 but pbz
produced no inhibition of cox-1 at concentrations up to 10 lm.
for cox-2 inhibition by pbz, this represents a seven-fold
interlaboratory difference, at least partially explained by the fact
that brideau et al. (2001) used a whole blood assay, while
ricketts et al. (1998) used isolated cells.
whatever the basis of the species difference between horses and
cattle, the present data for the first time indicate that much higher
pbz concentrations in plasma and at inflammatory sites will be
required in cattle for clinical efficacy than in horses. required
concentrations in cattle will not be provided by a single dose of
4.4 mg ⁄ kg pbz. future studies will be required (a) to determine
the single pbz dose required for efficacy and (b) whether
4.4 mg ⁄ kg administered daily will be effective clinically when
steady state concentrations have been achieved. martin et al.
(1984) reported a minimum steady state concentration of
100.4 lg ⁄ ml pbz with a dosage schedule of 5 mg ⁄ kg orally
twice daily. as already reported for the horse (toutain et al.,
1994), it will be possible to predict pbz efficacy in cattle using
pharmacokinetic-pharmacodyamic modelling methods based on
clinical response and the sigmoidal emax equation, once dosage is
increased to levels producing 80–90% inhibition of cox enzymes.
this study was designed to apply this approach, but this could not
be undertaken, since the dose of pbz selected failed, surprisingly,
to produce significant inhibition of serum txb2 and exudate pge2
when administered by both i.v. and oral routes.
the therapeutic range of plasma concentrations for pbz in
cattle has not been established. on the basis of comparison with
effective concentrations in the horse, eberhardson et al. (1979)
proposed a concentration of 20 lg ⁄ ml and calculated a tentative
dosage regimes (orally) of 9 mg ⁄ kg loading dose and maintenance doses of 4.5 mg ⁄ kg at 48 h intervals. however, from the
present data on pge2 inhibition and clinical response, a target
concentration of 20 lg ⁄ ml pbz in plasma will be too low. de
backer et al. (1980), on the basis of effective therapeutic
 2002 blackwell science ltd, j. vet. pharmacol. therap. 25, 299–309

concentrations in human plasma, suggested a therapeutic range
of 60–90 lg ⁄ ml for cattle. to achieve steady state levels in this
range rapidly, a loading dose of 10–20 mg ⁄ kg and maintenance
doses of 2.5–5 mg ⁄ kg ⁄ day were proposed. on the basis of clinical
observation williams et al. (1990b) quoting howard (1988,
personal communication) suggested that pbz doses of 6 mg ⁄ kg
daily appear to be effective in controlling pain in musculoskeletal
disorders. however, for the therapy of acute mastitis pyorälä
et al., 1988) reported no significant effect of 2 · 10 mg ⁄ kg doses
i.v. 24 h apart on either infection or inflammation in cows with
acute mastitis and dascanio et al. (1994) reported no benefit
from a single i.v. dose of 4 g pbz (approximately 6.7 mg ⁄ kg) in
cows with clinical toxic mastitis. as discussed in this paper, the
new science of pk-pd modelling can now be used to design a
rational dosage schedule for pbz for the treatment of bovine
inflammatory diseases. however, in addition to efficacy considerations, the use of pbz in food producing species will require
establishment of meat and milk withdrawal periods.
