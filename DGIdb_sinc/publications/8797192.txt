phenoxybenzamine

our earlier observation that the antipsychotic drug
haloperidol in the absence of dopamine increases camp
formation and prolactin release in two prolactin-producing
cell lines expressing rat dopamine 02 receptors (ch,,
gh4zr 1 ), but not in similar cells devoid of 02 receptors
(gh4c1), prompted us to suggest that haloperidol may act
as an inverse (or negative) agonist, rather than as a neutral
antagonist, at the 02 receptor (nilsson and eriksson 1993).
in the present study it is shown that /zaloperidol elicits a
dose-dependent increase in prolactin release also in
prolactin-producing gh4c 1 cells transfected with the
human dopamine 02 receptor (short isoform) (gh4c1-

hd2s); in addition, it is shown that another antipsychotic
drug,  xxxd2137xxx , also causes prolactin release per se in
this cell line. the effect of haloperidol on prolactin release in
gh4c1-hd2s is calcium dependent and counteracted by
pretreatment either with the 0 2 receptor agonist r(-)-npropylnorapomorphine or with a 02 receptor antagonist
that does not affect prolactin release per se (raclopride). in
addition, pretreatment with the alkylating compound
phenoxybenzamine at a concentration causing a marked
reduction of 02 receptor density in gh4c 1-hd2s cells
significantly counteracted haloperidol-induced prolactin
release. [neuropsychopharmacology 15:53-61, 1996]

ing rat dopamine d2 receptors spontaneously (gh3) or
by means of transfection (ghizr7) (nilsson and eriksson 1993). because no prolactin-releasing effect was observed in cells devoid of d2 receptors (gh4c1), it was
suggested that this effect of haloperidol in gh3 and
gh4zr7 cells is mediated by d2 receptors; thus, we proposed that haloperidol in this experimental setting may
act as an inverse (negative) agonist rather than as a neutral antagonist vis-a-vis the  xxxg656xxx . in
contrast, the  xxxg656xxx  antagonist raclopride, while
inhibiting agonist-induced prolactin suppression from
gh4zr7 cells, does not cause prolactin release per se
(nilsson and eriksson 1995).
the purpose of the present study was to explore further whether the observed effect of haloperidol on prolactin release in vitro is indeed mediated by d2 recep-

tors. to this end we show that the effect of haloperidol
on prolactin release previously observed in cell lines expressing the rat  xxxg656xxx  (gh4zr7, gh 3) is observed
also in cells transfected with the human d 2 receptor
(short isoform) (gh4c1-hd2s). the effect is shown to be
calcium dependent and to be counteracted by pretreatment with the  xxxg656xxx  agonist r(-)-n-propylnorapomorphine, the neutral  xxxg656xxx  antagonist raclopride,
or the receptor alkylating compound phenoxybenzamine.

materials and methods
drugs and chemicals
dopamine hydrochloride (sigma, st. louis, mo, usa),
raclopride tartrate (astra ab, sodertalje, sweden), and
 xxxg2417xxx  (vip, sigma) were all dissolved in earle's  xxxd2988xxx  (ebss, biochrom) supplemented with 0.2% bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa, sigma). r(-)-n-propylnorapomorphine hydrochloride (npa, rbi, natick, ma, usa), and czs- xxxd2137xxx  hydrochloride (lundbeck ab, helsingborg,
sweden) were dissolved in water. phenoxybenzamine
(rbi) was solubilized using 50% ethanol and diluted in
ebss, yielding a final concentration of ethanol <0.5'3/o.
haloperidol (leo ab, helsingborg, sweden) was solubilized in tartaric acid and ethanol and diluted in ebss;
the final concentrations of tartaric acid and ethanol
were <0.5 nm and <0.5%, respectively.

cell culture
transfected gh.ic 1 cells expressing the short isoform of
the human dopamine 02 receptor (gh4c 1-hd2s) (batch
zem 3#3) were kindly provided by dr. olivier civelli,
hoffman-la roche ag, basel, switzerland, and kept
frozen in liquid nitrogen before being thawed, propagated, and passaged by means of trypsin-edta dissociation. stock cultures (monolayers) of gh 4c 1-hd2s cells
were maintained in nunclon t-25 flasks (nunc a/s,
roskilde, denmark) with approximately 10 ml of
ham's f-10 medium (biochrom kg, berlin, germany)
supplemented with 3.7 g/1 sodium bicarbonate
(sigma), 15% horse serum (biochrom), 2.5% fetal calf serum (biochrom), 100 u/ml  xxxd2871xxx  + 100 µg/ml
streptomycin, 0.6 µg/ml  xxxd164xxx , and 1 mm
1-glutamine (sigma) and incubated at 37°c in a watersaturated atmosphere of 5''.o co2 in air. passages were
performed weekly; in addition, the total medium was
changed once between each passage.

radioligand binding
gh4c1-hd2s cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture
dishes in 10 ml of the same medium as in the stock cul-

neuropsychopharmacology 1996-vol. 15, no. 1

ture. on the day of the experiment, cells were incubated
for 60 minutes with either 15 µm phenoxybenzamine
dissolved in ebss + bsa or ebss + bsa only. each
dish was rinsed with dulbecco's phosphate-buffered
saline (pbs); then the cells were scraped into cold pbs,
pelleted by centrifugation (500 x g, 7 minutes), resuspended in cold buffer (50 mm tris-hci, 5 mm edta,
5 mm egta, ph 7.5 at 25°c), and homogenized using a
dounce glass-teflon homogenizer. the membrane suspension was centrifuged (250 x g, 7 minutes) in order
to remove unlysed cells, the supernatant was retained,
and the pellet was rehomogenized and centrifuged
again (250 x g, 7 minutes); then the combined supernatants were centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 18 minutes. the
final membrane pellet was resuspended in radioligand
binding buffer (50 mm tris-hci, 4 mm mgch, 1.5 mm
cach, 5 mm kc!, 1 mm edta, 120 mm nacl, ph 7.5 at
25°c), and aliquots were stored at -70°c until used in
radioligand binding experiments.
for determination of dopamine d 2 receptor density
and affinity, triplicates of cell membrane suspension
(1 ml corresponding to 18-26 µg protein) were incubated for 20 minutes at 37°c in radioligand binding
buffer (as described) with five to six concentrations (301,000 pm) of [3h]spiperone (97-107 ci/mmol, amersham) dissolved in radioligand binding buffer with
0.1%  xxxd228xxx  and 0.01% bsa. for each concentration of [3h]spiperone, nonspecific binding was assessed
by adding 10 µm of the 02 receptor agonist 6,7-adtn
(rbi) to triplicate samples. the reaction was terminated
by rapid filtration through whatman cf /b filters
coated with 0.1 °/4, polyethyleneimine using a cell harvester (brandel, gaithersburg, md, usa) followed by
washing with cold buffer (4 ml 50 mm tris-hci, three
times). the radioactivity trapped on the filters was assessed using a liquid scintillation counter (efficiency approximately 30%). protein concentration was determined according to a modified lowry assay using bsa
as standard (markwell et al. 1978). data were analyzed
using the nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting computer
program ligand (munson and rodbard 1980).

prolactin experiments
one week before an experiment, gh4c1-hd2s cells were
seeded in nunclon 16 mm 24-multiwell plates in an
amount of 200.000 cells per well in 500 µl of the same
medium as in stock culture but without  xxxd164xxx .
in order to avoid "edge effects" that could affect cell
growth, in most experiments only the central eight
wells on each plate were used, whereas the 16 peripheral wells were filled with 500 µl of sterile water.
immediately before the experiments, the cells were
washed twice (15 minutes each time) in warmed, co2equilibrated ebss supplemented with 0.2% bsa (our
experimental medium).

inverse agonism of haloperidol at human dopamine d2 receptors 55

to avoid systematic errors due to factors related to
the position of the well on the plate, every second well
was given the experimental drug (e.g., haloperidol),
whereas every second well served as control. in the
dose-response experiment, all different doses of haloperidol-and vehicle-were added in random order to
the wells on each plate; in this experiment all 24 wells
on each plate were used.
in all experiments the experimental incubation lasted
for 30 minutes; then the supernatants were gently pipetted from the wells, centrifuged (300 x g, 5 minutes) in
order to remove any remaining cells, and frozen for
subsequent analysis of prolactin by means of radioimmunoassay (as described later).
because prolactin levels often showed some interplate variability, the prolactin level in a well was always
calculated as a percent of the mean prolactin level of the
control wells (receiving vehicle only) on the same plate.
thus, all values are presented as percent of controls.
generally, prolactin levels in wells situated on the
same plate and exposed to the same treatment showed
small variability. however, occasionally, the prolactin
level in a sample from one well was highly aberrant
compared to that from the other wells on the same plate
receiving the same treatment. this phenomenon can
probably be related to various experimental artifacts,
such as the removal of a large number of poorly attached cells from the well during the washes preceding
the incubation or remaining whole cells in the supernatant used for prolactin determination. as a rule, a prolactin value of a control well being 30'1/c, higher or lower
than the mean value of the three other control wells
from the same plate was excluded from further calculations. in wells given prolactin-releasing agents (such as
haloperidol), the variability was generally somewhat
higher than in vehicle-treated wells; for these wells the
rule applied was that values being 50% higher or lower
than the mean value of the three other wells given the
same treatment were excluded.

experiment 1: for the assessment of the effect of
dopamine on vip- (300 nm) induced prolactin release in
gh.1c1-hd2s cells, dopamine (50 nm) dissolved in 400
µj of experimental medium was given to half of the
wells on each plate; 5 minutes later, 100 µj of experimental medium containing vip was added to all wells.
after vip had been added, cells were incubated for 30
minutes.
experiment 2: in the second prolactin experiment, the
prolactin-releasing effect of various doses of haloperidol in otherwise untreated cells was studied. haloperidol
was dissolved in the entire experimental medium (500
f.d); control wells recei\·ed experimental medium only.

experiment 3: in the third prolactin experiment the
prolactin-releasing effect of flupcnthixol (1 or 10 µm) in

otherwise untreated cells was studied.  xxxd2137xxx 
was dissolved in the entire experimental medium (500
µl) whereas the other wells on the same plate received
experimental medium only.

experiment 4: in the fourth experiment the effect of
calcium on haloperidol- (1 µm) induced prolactin release was studied. on half of the plates all wells were
given ordinary experimental medium (i.e., ebss +
bsa), whereas on the remaining plates all wells were
given the same medium but without calcium. half of
the wells on each plate received haloperidol dissolved
in the entire medium (500 µl); the other wells on the
same plate received experimental medium only.

experiment 5: in the fifth experiment the effect of
npa (10 µm) on haloperidol- (1 µm) induced prolactin
release was studied. npa dissolved in 400 µl of medium was given to all wells on half of the plates; 5 minutes later 100 µi of experimental medium containing
haloperidol was added to half of the wells whereas the
other half received 100 µi of medium only. on the control plates all wells received experimental medium only
instead of medium containing npa; again, haloperidol
was added to half of the wells. for cells incubated with
npa, this compound was also present in the experimental medium during the second of the washes preceding the experimental incubation.
experiment 6: in the sixth experiment the effect of
raclopride (100 µm) on haloperidol- (1 µm) induced
prolactin release was studied. the design of the experiment was the same as in fifth experiment, the only exception being that raclopride was given instead of npa.
experiment 7: in the seventh experiment the effect of
preincubation of gh.1c 1-ho2s with phenoxybenzamine
(15 µm) on haloperidol-induced prolactin release was
studied. cells were exposed to phenoxybenzamine dissolved in experimental medium (500 µl) for 60 minutes;
then the cells were washed twice and incubated with or
without haloperidol (1 µm) for 30 minutes, as described. the cells were not exposed to phenoxybenzamine during the washes or during the experimental
incubation.
experiment 8: in the eighth experiment the effect of
treatment with raclopride (100 µm) or pretreatment
with phenoxybenzamine (15 µm) on vip- (300 nm) induced prolactin release was studied. one-third of the
plates were preincubated with phenoxybenzamine (as
in experiment 7), whereas one-third were treated with
raclopride (as in experiment 6); one-third of the plates
served as controls. to wells containing 400 µl of experimental medium were added either 100 µl of vip-containing medium or 100 µl of experimental medium
only.

cells no or very few 02 receptors can be detected (albert
et al. 1990; allard et al. 1993; unpublished data), in the
transfected cell line the brnax for the 02 receptor, as assessed using f'h]-spiperone as ligand, was 750 fmol/
mg protein. also, by means of northern blot, human 02
mrna could be detected in gh4ci-ho 2s cells but not
in wild-type gh4c 1 cells (unpublished data). that the
02 receptors expressed in gh4c1-ho2s cells are functionally coupled to intracellular transduction mechanisms is supported by the finding that dopamine effectively antagonized vip-induced prolactin release in
gh1c1-ho2s cells; in contrast, in wild-type gh4c1 cells,
vip-induced prolactin release is unaffected by dopamine 02 agonists (unpublished data).
we have previously shown (nilsson and eriksson
1993) that haloperidol, also in the absence of agonist,
causes camp formation and prolactin release in prolactinproducing cells spontaneously expressing rat 0 2 receptors (gh3, mainly long isoform) (johnston et al. 1991;
missale et al. 1991; zhang et al. 1993) and from gh4c 1
cells transfected with the rat 02 receptor (gh.izr7, short
isoform) (albert et al. 1990), but not from wild-type
gh4c1 cells lacking both 02 receptor mrna and 02 receptor binding sites (albert et al. 1990; allard et al.
1990; burris and freeman 1994). the present finding
that haloperidol, in the absence of agonist, causes a
dose-dependent prolactin release also from cells transfected with the human 02 receptor (short isoform) lends
further support for the assumption that haloperidolinduced prolactin release in vitro is indeed 02 mediated; thus, we have now been able to demonstrate a haloperidol-induced prolactin release from three out of
three cell lines expressing 02 receptors, but not from related cells lacking 02 receptors. moreover, we have previously reported that haloperidol, in the absence of agonist, causes an increase in camp formation (i.e., the
effect on camp opposite to that induced by dopamine)
in gh:i and gh4zr7 cells (nilsson and eriksson 1993).
similarly, preliminary experiments indicate that haloperidol increases the accumulation of camp after pretreatment with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) also in gh4c1-ho2s cells
(unpublished data).
calcium is important for spontaneous as well as
secretagogue-induced prolactin release (bjoro et al.
1984). the present obseiyation that the effect of haloperidol was calcium dependent supports the notion
that it is not due to a toxic influence on the cells but to
an interaction with the transduction mechanisms involved in the physiological control of prolactin secretion.
the magnitude of the effect of haloperidol on prolactin release from gh4zr 1, gh:i, and gh1ci-ho2s usually
varies from one experiment to another. for example, the
response is often weak or even absent when the cells
have reached a high density in the wells in which they
are grown the week before the experiment; the response

neuropsychopharmacology 1996-vol. 15, no. 1

also usually declines in cell populations that have been
the subject of many passages; both observations are
probably related to a reduction in 02 receptor expression and/ or receptor/ g-protein coupling. we have previously reported that in gh4zr7 and gh3 cells haloperidol may cause prolactin release at concentrations as
low as 30 nm (nilsson and eriksson 1993); in the
present study the ic so of haloperidol was 400 nm. however, because of the large interexperimental variability
of the prolactin response to nanomolar concentrations
of haloperidol, in most experiments presented in this
article, haloperidol was administered at a concentration
ofl µm.
in most displacement experiments using rat or human 02 receptors, haloperidol has been attributed a ki
value of approximately 0.5 to 5 nm (castro and strange
1993); however, in some reports, the k of haloperidol
has been considerably higher (30-100 nm) (sander et al.
1994). when comparing these ki values with ecso of haloperidol observed in the present study, it should be
taken into consideration that higher concentrations may
be required in order to induce uncoupling of precoupled receptors than to displace an antagonist in radioligand binding experiments (vogel et al. 1995). as yet, the
experience of the doses required to achieve "functional"
inverse agonism vis-a-vis g-protein-coupled receptors
in intact cells is sparse; thus, whether the affinity to
ligands of spontaneously precoupled receptors differs
from that of uncoupled receptors remains to be established.
the stimulating effect of haloperidol on prolactin release from gh4c1-ho2s cells could be counteracted by
pretreatment with high concentrations of the 02 receptor agonist npa; similarly, we have previously found
that pretreatment with npa effectively antagonizes the
effects of haloperidol on both camp formation and prolactin release in gh 4zr1 cells (unpublished data). the
effect of npa is well in line with the concept that haloperidol-induced prolactin release is d2 mediated; however, because in gh4c1-ho2s and gh4zr7 cells dopamine receptor agonists inhibit prolactin release induced
also by nondopaminergic receptors partly interacting
with the same second messenger systems, such as those
for vip and trh, the finding that npa reduces haloperidol-induccd prolactin release constitutes no conclusive evidence for an involvement of 02 receptors in the
effect of the latter drug.
in a previous study inverse agonism at beta-adrenoceptors could be counteracted by pretreatment with an
antagonist displaying less inverse efficacy (chidiac et
al. 1994). we have earlier shown that the selective 02
antagonist raclopride is devoid of prolactin-releasing
effects per se at gh cells (nilsson and eriksson 1995);
the present finding that pretreatment with high concentrations of raclopride significantly reduced haloperidolinduced prolactin release, while not affecting the prolac-

inverse agonism of haloperidol at human dopamine 02 receptors 59

tin response to vip, strongly supports the assumption
that the prolactin release induced by haloperidol is indeed  xxxg656xxx  mediated. it should be noted that high
concentrations of raclopride were required to antagonize the effect of haloperidol; similarly, in the study by
chidiac and coworkers (1994), a concentration of 100 µm
of  xxxd2435xxx  was used to antagonize the inverse effects of
 xxxd3377xxx  (100 nm) at beta-adrenoceptors.
it has earlier been shown (shin et al. 1992) that preincubation of a primary culture of rat adenohypophyseal
cells for 1 hour with the receptor alkylating compound
phenoxybenzamine markedly reduces dopamine-mediated inhibition of prolactin release at a concentration
not influencing changes in prolactin release induced by
other receptors (somatostatin, trh,  xxxg99xxx ). in
the present study exposure of gh4c1-hd2s cells to phenoxybenzamine was shown to abolish d2 receptors as
measured using [3h]-spiperone binding; the finding that
haloperidol-induced prolactin release was significantly
blunted in phenoxybenzamine exposed cells whereas
the response to vip was less affected thus lends further
support for the concept that haloperidol-induced prolactin release is indeed a d2-mediated phenomenon.
additional support for the involvement of d 2 receptors in haloperidol-induced prolactin release was obtained from the observation that another antipsychotic
drug with affinity for d2 receptors, the thioxanthene derivative  xxxd2137xxx , was also found to induce a significant
increase in prolactin release from gh 4ci-h02s cells.
all experiments in this study were undertaken in a
serum-free,  xxxd2988xxx  and preceded by repeated washing of the cells; however, albeit unlikely,
the possibility that the effects of haloperidol and  xxxd2137xxx  are due to antagonism of small amounts of
dopamine present in the serum-containing medium in
which the cells were grown before the experiment
should not be ignored. however, the fact that raclopride effectively antagonizes both dopamine-induced
prolactin suppression (nilsson and eriksson 1995) and
haloperidol-induced prolactin release (this report) without mimicking the prolactin releasing effect of haloperidol in the absence of agonists (nilsson and eriksson
1993) refutes the possibility that the effect of haloperidol is merely due to displacement of small amounts of
dopamine from its receptors.
the concept of inverse (or negative) agonism originally emanates from studies on benzodiazepine receptors associated with the ga baai chloride channel complex; however, recently, several authors have suggested
that g-protein coupled receptors, such as opioid (costa
and herz 1989), muscarinic (hilf and jakobs 1992),
dopamine  xxxd113xxx  (tiberi and caron 1994), shi 2 (barker et
al. 1994; labreque et al. 1994; westphal and sandersbush 1994), and ~2 (adie and milligan 1994; chidiac et
al. 1994; mewes et al. 1994) receptors may also be the
subjects of inverse agonism. the earliest of these reports

were based on experiments using membrane preparations; however, recently several research groups have
demonstrated inverse agonism in intact cells, too. the
concepts of constitutive activity and of inverse agonism
of g-protein coupled receptors have been thoroughly
discussed in several recent papers (costa et al. 1992;
schutz and freissmuth 1992; lefkowitz et al. 1993; onaran et al. 1993; tian and deth 1993; leeb-lundberg et al.
1994; milligan et al. 1995).
apart from our reports on haloperidol-induced
camp formation and prolactin release in gh3, gh4zr7,
and gh4c 1-h02s cells (nilsson and eriksson 1993; this
paper), reports on the negative efficacy of dopamine d2
antagonists in the absence of agonists are as yet sparse.
however, more than 15 years ago, chlorpromazine was
in fact reported to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity
in broken cell preparations from gh3 cells (clementcormier et al. 1977; heindel and clement-cormier
1981); similar effects were also obtained with fluphenazine in fragments from human prolactin adenomas
(de camilli et al. 1979). more recently the 02 antagonist
(-)-sulpiride was reported to act as an  xxxd1422xxx  at
d2 receptors with respect to protein kinase c activity in
reconstituted synaptoneurosomes (giambalvo and wagner 1994); in addition, radioligand binding data supporting the concept that human d2 receptors transfected into gh4 cells are also partly activated in the
absence of agonist were recently reported (kramer and
deth 1995; tian and deth 1993). finally, it should be
mentioned that 10 years ago wreggett and de lean
(1984), on the basis of computer modeling of experimental radioligand binding data obtained from membrane
homogenates of bovine anterior pituitary glands, suggested that d2 receptors could appear in a coupled state
also in the absence of agonist and that this spontaneous
precoupling could be counteracted by an antagonist.
whether the concept of inverse agonism at g-protein-coupled receptors is of significance also in vivo remains to be established. interestingly, recent data from
our laboratory indicate that in male rats pretreatment
with raclopride in a dose causing prolactin release per
se counteracts the elevation of serum levels of prolactin
induced by haloperidol (unpublished). inverse agonism
at d 2 autoreceptors regulating dopamine release was
also recently suggested on the basis of in vivo microdialysis experiments (carlsson et al. 1991).
ln spite of the fact that raclopride displays high affinity for dopamine d 2 receptors, with respect to both extrapyramidal side effects and to antipsychotic efficacy,
this compound appears somewhat less powerful than
haloperidol (the british isles raclopride study group
1992). given the present data, it is tempting to speculate
that this difference between haloperidol and raclopride
could at least be related partly to a difference in inverse
efficacy at d 2 receptors in the striatum and the nucleus
accumbens.
