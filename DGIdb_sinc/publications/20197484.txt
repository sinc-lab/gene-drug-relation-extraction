abstract
purpose: this study aimed to determine a maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and recommended dose
for disease-directed studies of  xxxd2706xxx  ( xxxd2706xxx ), a fully human igg1 monoclonal antibody directed at the  xxxg681xxx  receptor, and to characterize the safety profile, pharmacokinetics,
preliminary antitumor activity, and immunogenicity of  xxxd2706xxx .
experimental design: patients with advanced solid malignancies were treated with 100 to 1,000 mg
(flat dosing)  xxxd2706xxx  followed by a 2-week pharmacokinetics sampling period, before beginning
6-week cycles of therapy.
results: sixty patients received  xxxd2706xxx  weekly (29 patients) or every other week (31 patients).
two patients receiving 1,000 mg every 2 weeks experienced dose-limiting toxicities (dlt; grade 3 headache), accompanied by grade 3 nausea and vomiting in one patient. occurring hours after the initial dose,
these dlts established 800 mg as the mtd. mild dose-related skin toxicity was the most common drugrelated toxicity (80%). one patient in each arm experienced grade 3 acneform rash, which responded to
oral antibiotics and topical therapy. toxicity was similar on both schedules.  xxxd2706xxx  exhibited saturable elimination and nonlinear pharmacokinetics. at 800 mg (both arms), its half-life was approximately 7 days. all patients treated with ≥600 mg  xxxd2706xxx  achieved target trough concentrations
(≥40 mug/ml). antibodies against  xxxd2706xxx  were not detected. partial response and stable disease
were experienced by 2 and 16 patients, respectively.
conclusion: well tolerated,  xxxd2706xxx  is associated with preliminary evidence of antitumor activity, and achieves biologically relevant concentrations throughout the dosing period. the recommended
dose of  xxxd2706xxx  for further clinical development is 800 mg (flat dose) weekly or every 2 weeks

activation of the  xxxg681xxx  receptor
(egfr), a member of the egfr subfamily of type i receptor tyrosine kinases, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human malignancies (1–4). the binding of
egfr ligands to the egfr, including the epidermal
growth factor, transforming growth factor-alpha,  xxxg185xxx , and  xxxd2988xxx , influences cellular proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and metastasis via a number of

critical signaling cascades such as the reticular activating
system/mitogen activated protein kinase, phospholipase
c-gamma, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase b, and
the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathways (1–3).
both egfr expression and egfr-mediated activation of
downstream signaling pathways are related to poor outcome in many types of cancer (5–10). furthermore, several tumor types, particularly colorectal, head and neck, and
lung cancers, coexpress the egfr and its ligands, indicating a potential for autocrine activation of the receptor; coexpression of egfr and its ligands has also been identified
as a poor prognostic indicator (11–15). both monoclonal
antibody (mab) and small molecule therapeutics targeting
the egfr have shown to be efficacious as monotherapy
and in combination regimens.
 xxxd2706xxx  ( xxxd2706xxx ; imclone systems) is a fully
 xxxd2207xxx , subclass 1 (igg1) mab targeting the egfr, designed with specific characteristics in an
effort to maximize its therapeutic index in the clinic.

translational relevance
in this first-in-man study,  xxxd2706xxx  is a fully
human igg1 monoclonal antibody to the epidermal
growth factor receptor (egfr) that was designed to integrate structural and clinical features so that its therapeutic index would be more favorable than other
egfr-targeting monoclonal antibodies.  xxxd2706xxx 
was shown to be well tolerated, with evidence of antitumor activity at doses capable of producing therapeutically relevant trough concentrations throughout the
dosing period. on the basis of the preclinical attributes
of  xxxd2706xxx , as well as the favorable safety and
pharmacokinetic profiles shown in this phase i pharmacologic study,  xxxd2706xxx  is undergoing phase
ii and iii clinical evaluations in multiple oncologic indications worldwide.

antigen binding targeting the egfr from a phage display
library,  xxxd2706xxx  was engineered to bind to the egfr
with high affinity (kd = 0.32 nmol/l) and block the
binding of relevant egfr ligands (ic50 = 1-2 nmol/l;
ref. 16).  xxxd2706xxx  neutralizes ligand-induced egfr
phosphorylation (ic50 = 1.5-3 nmol/l; ref. 16) and downstream signaling in multiple tumor cell lines, and inhibits
proliferation of egfr-dependent difi tumor cells (ic50 =
0.8-1.0 nmol/l; ref. 16). in addition, as a fully human
igg1 construct, treatment with  xxxd2706xxx  would be expected to result in a decreased potential for hypersensitivity and increased potential to mediate efficient
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells to egfr-expressing cancer cells.  xxxd2706xxx  has shown significant antitumor
activity in multiple established human xenograft tumor
models, and augments the antitumor effects of irinotecan
and oxaliplatin in a panel of colorectal cancer models
(16). the antitumor effects of  xxxd2706xxx  in preclinical
studies were either comparable with or superior to those
observed with cetuximab (16).
the primary objective of this first-in-man trial was to
determine a maximum tolerated dose (mtd) and a dose
to recommend for subsequent disease-directed studies.
secondary objectives included characterization of the
safety profile, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of
 xxxd2706xxx , and a preliminary assessment of its antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid malignancies.

patients and methods
study design. patients were randomized into one of two
arms. following randomization, patients in both arms received one  xxxd2706xxx  infusion at their assigned cohort
dose level (see table 1), followed by a 2-wk treatment-free
“rest” period to enable pharmacokinetic sampling before

beginning repetitive 6-week cycles of therapy. in arm a,
patients received  xxxd2706xxx  once a week, whereas  xxxd2706xxx  was administered once every 2 wk to patients
in arm b. the starting dose in cohort 1 of each arm was
100 mg; the dose escalation schemes along with actual enrollment into each cohort are summarized in table 1.  xxxd2706xxx  was administered as a flat (unit) dose based
on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of the antiegfr antibody cetuximab, which indicated that body
weight and height (determinants of body surface area)
were not significant covariates of clearance (17).
a treatment cohort was considered complete when three
patients completed the initial pharmacokinetic sampling
period and the first 6-wk treatment cycle without experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (dlt), which was defined
as any grade 3 or 4 major organ toxicity that was at least
possibly related to  xxxd2706xxx . once a given cohort was
completed, dose escalation to the next cohort was to occur. however, if one patient in a cohort experienced a
dlt during the first cycle, three additional patients were
to be enrolled in that cohort; if no additional patient in
the same cohort experienced a dlt, dose escalation was
to proceed. if a second patient in the same cohort experienced a dlt, dose escalation was not to occur, and the
preceding dose level was to be considered the mtd for
that arm. therefore, the mtd was defined as the dose preceding the dose level at which at least two patients experienced a dlt. once the mtd was identified, additional
patients were to be enrolled at the mtd. if no dlts were
observed during the first cycle in any cohort, then three
additional patients each (to a total of six patients per cohort) were to be enrolled in cohorts 5 (800 mg) and 6
(1,000 mg), which were projected a priori to be relevant
human doses of  xxxd2706xxx .
all patients were evaluated for tumor response according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors guidelines (18). following the initial 6-wk treatment cycle,
patients continued to receive additional cycles of therapy
at the same dose and schedule as long as there was no disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
patients. eligible patients were ≥18 y old, with solid malignancies that were refractory to standard treatment or for
which standard treatment was not available. participants
were required to have measurable or nonmeasurable, evaluable disease, eastern cooperative oncology group performance status (ecog ps) of ≥2, a life expectancy of ≥3
mo, and adequate hematopoietic (absolute neutrophil
count ≥1,500/mul; hemoglobin >9 g/l; platelet count
≥100,000/mul), hepatic [alkaline phosphatase ≤5.0 × the
upper limit of normal (uln), bilirubin ≤1.5 × the uln,
and aspartate aminotransferase / xxxg941xxx 
≤2.5 × the uln or ≤5 × the uln in the presence of liver
metastases), and renal functions (serum creatinine within
normal limits). key exclusion criteria included concurrent
uncontrolled disease or additional malignancy (other
than basal cell carcinoma or cervical carcinoma in situ),
newly diagnosed or symptomatic brain metastases, prior
egfr-targeted therapy, or pregnancy. all patients were

with applicable local and institutional guidelines.
evaluation procedures. pretreatment evaluations were
done within 14 d prior to treatment. evaluation procedures done pretreatment and every 2 wk during treatment
included a medical history with an assessment of adverse
events, physical examination, laboratory testing (chemistry, coagulation, and hematology studies and urinalysis),
and determination of ecog ps. pregnancy testing was
done on women of childbearing potential pretreatment
and every 6 wk thereafter.
to assess tumor status, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was done within 2 wk prior to
 xxxd2706xxx  treatment in the first cycle (unless previous
imaging had been done during or within 2 wk prior to the
beginning of the 2-wk pharmacokinetic sampling period),
after the first two treatment cycles (6 and 12 wk after the
first dose of  xxxd2706xxx  in the first cycle), and at least
every 12 wk thereafter.
pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity analyses. for all patients enrolled in the study, extensive pharmacokinetic
sampling was done following  xxxd2706xxx  administration during the first and final infusion of the initial 6-wk
treatment cycle. thereafter, 5- to 10-ml pharmacokinetic
samples were obtained prior to and 1 h after the completion of the final  xxxd2706xxx  infusion of each cycle, as
well as 45 d after the last dose was administered. for each
 xxxd2706xxx  sampling time point, a 5- to 10-ml blood
sample was collected and allowed to coagulate at room
temperature for 30 to 60 min. after centrifugation, the serum supernatant was collected and stored at -20°c to
-80°c until analysis. a validated biacore 3000-based instrument method was used to determine serum concentrations of  xxxd2706xxx . briefly, soluble egfr was
covalently coupled to certified cm5 sensor chips (ge
healthcare life sciences). prior to analysis, serum  xxxd2706xxx  samples were diluted 100-fold with hepes buffered
saline (hbs-ep) biacore running buffer.  xxxd2706xxx 
samples were injected at 20 mul/min in hbs-ep and quantitated by comparing the resulting biacore plasmon
resonance signal with that obtained from a standard
 xxxd2706xxx  preparation.  xxxd2706xxx  calibration
curves were linear in the undiluted concentration range

of 11.72 to 1,500 ng/ml. the lower limit of quantification
for the undiluted  xxxd2706xxx  sample was 11.72 ng/ml.
a  xxxd2706xxx  concentration of 40 mug/ml at steady state
was selected a priori as biologically relevant and represents
the lowest concentration that exhibited antitumor activity in
preclinical xenograft models. serum trough concentrations
of  xxxd2706xxx  achieved at the mtd and recommended
phase ii dose are expected to result in levels that meet or
exceed this target with an acceptable safety profile.
serum blood samples used to evaluate formation of
antibodies against  xxxd2706xxx  were obtained prior to
the initial infusion of the pharmacokinetic sampling period and prior to the final dose in each treatment cycle.
antibodies against  xxxd2706xxx  were determined using
a double antigen radiometric assay. briefly,  xxxd2706xxx 
was immobilized onto polystyrene beads, which were
then incubated with serum samples. any anti- xxxd2706xxx  (drug) antibodies (ada) present in the sample
bound to the beads to form an ada: xxxd2706xxx  complex. 125i-labeled  xxxd2706xxx  was used as a tracer to
identify bound ada, which was reported in ng/ml of
bound 125i-labeled  xxxd2706xxx . the cut point for a positive sample was 6 ng/ml of bound 125i-labeled  xxxd2706xxx . a patient was considered to have a positive response
if the patient's postbaseline anti- xxxd2706xxx  level was
more than twice the baseline value for at least two consecutive determinations, or if the positive determination was
for the final time point sampled. patients with a baseline
anti- xxxd2706xxx  level >6 mug/ml were considered nonevaluable for an anti- xxxd2706xxx  response.
noncompartmental pharmacokinetic analysis and
mathematical modeling were done using winnonlin
5.1 (pharsight). an anova of  xxxd2706xxx  clearance
as a function of dose and weight was done using the “fit
model” platform of jmp 6.0.

schedule).
fifty-five (91.7%) patients discontinued treatment due
to disease progression. two patients withdrew consent,
and three patients (two in arm a, one in arm b) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, including one dlt.
two patients (one in each arm) discontinued treatment
due to an adverse event, one due to a grade 4 cerebrovascular accident and one due to a grade 2 left pneumothorax; neither event was related to  xxxd2706xxx .
no dlts were observed in cohorts 1 to 5 (100 to 800
mg) of either arm, or in cohort 6 (1,000-mg dose level) of
arm a. however, two patients in cohort 6 of arm b ( xxxd2706xxx  at 1,000 mg every 2 weeks) experienced  xxxd2706xxx -related adverse events that were considered dlts.
the first, a 70-year-old man with prostate cancer, experienced grade 3 headache, nausea, and vomiting, as well
as grade 1 fever, immediately after his first treatment. all
toxicities resolved completely within 6 days of onset.
however, the patient was discontinued from the study as
a result of these events. the second patient also developed

a grade 3 headache associated with a grade 1 fever 6 hours
after completing his first  xxxd2706xxx  infusion, with
grade 1 nausea and vomiting developing over the next
5 hours. because the constellation of these grade 3 adverse
events, consisting of headache, nausea, and vomiting, was
considered to be at least possibly related to  xxxd2706xxx ,
these events were classified as dose limiting. therefore,  xxxd2706xxx  was reintroduced with a dose reduction from
1,000 to 800 mg, with no recurrence of these events. because
both dlts occurred in the immediate posttreatment period
after a first dose of  xxxd2706xxx , they were felt to be related
to dose and not schedule; therefore, the previous dose level,
800 mg, was defined as the mtd for both schedules.
adverse events. patients in arm a received a median of 7
infusions (range, 1 to 74) of  xxxd2706xxx , spanning a
median of 8 weeks (range, 2 to 83), whereas patients in
arm b received a median of 4 infusions (range, 1 to 21),
spanning a median of 8 weeks (range, 2 to 40). the median relative dose intensity, measured over the entire dosing
period for all patients, was 100% for both arms (means,
98.1% and 97.3% for arms a and b, respectively). a single
patient in arm b (every-2-weeks dosing) received a dose
reduction from 1,000 to 800 mg.
overall,  xxxd2706xxx  treatment was well tolerated for
both weekly and every-2-weeks schedules. the most common drug-related adverse event was skin toxicity, which
was experienced by 80% of patients in both arms combined (79.3% in arm a; 80.6% in arm b). specifically,
the most common dermatologic toxicities included acneform rashes (65.5%), dry skin (41.4%), and skin fissures
(34.5%) in arm a, and acneform rashes (64.5%), pruritus
(22.6%), and dry skin (19.4%) in arm b. necitumumabrelated skin toxicity was cumulative and generally mild
(grade 1) in severity.
two patients experienced grade 3 acneform rashes. the
first was documented on study day 152 in a patient receiving  xxxd2706xxx  at the 400-mg once-per-week dose level.
the severity of the rash decreased to grade 1 concurrent
with treatment with oral antibiotics and topical therapy,
without either treatment delay or omission. the second
experienced a grade 3 acneform rash on study day 26 following treatment with  xxxd2706xxx  600 mg every
2 weeks. the severity of the rash decreased to grade 2 concurrent with treatment with oral antibiotics and topical
therapy. despite a brief  xxxd2706xxx  treatment delay of
7 days, treatment ensued in the patient who had a chronic
grade 2 rash during treatment, which eventually resolved
after discontinuation of  xxxd2706xxx .
table 3 summarizes adverse events related to  xxxd2706xxx , affecting >20% of patients in either arm or of worst
grade ≥3. the most common adverse events related to  xxxd2706xxx , which were predominately grade 1 or 2 in severity, included headache (42% of patients), nausea (33%
of patients), and vomiting (20% of patients). only 10
(16.7%) patients experienced adverse events of at least
grade 3 severity.

 xxxd2706xxx  seemed to be clearly dose dependent. similarly, skin toxicity related to  xxxd2706xxx  occurred with
approximately similar frequencies across all dose groups.
the incidences of dry skin, acneform dermatitis, and skin fis-

sures seemed to increase slightly at dose levels >600 mg;
however, the differences were modest, and the small number of patients involved precludes meaningful interpretation.
no hypersensitivity or infusion reactions were observed.

are presented in fig. 1. following  xxxd2706xxx  weekly
dosing at 600/800 mg, the mean trough concentrations
at 168 hours after the first and final infusions of cycle 1
were 57/163 mug/ml and 255/397 mug/ml, respectively. because the last pharmacokinetic sampling time point following the final infusion of arm b was 168 hours, the
minimum serum concentration (cmin) at 336 hours for
each subject was predicted by mathematical modeling.
following  xxxd2706xxx  every-2-weeks dosing at the
600- and 800-mg dose levels, the mean predicted trough
concentrations at 336 hours after the first and final infusion of cycle 1 were 10/49 mug/ml and 78/83 mug/ml,
respectively.
for cycle 2 onward, the mean serum trough concentrations of  xxxd2706xxx  at 600/800 mg were 105 mug/ml
(n = 1)/514 mug/ml (n = 2), respectively in arm a, and
107 mug/ml (n = 2)/76 mug/ml (n = 2), respectively in
arm b. this suggests that maintenance of trough concentrations above target concentrations (≥40 mug/ml) was
achieved throughout the treatment period.
no anti- xxxd2706xxx  antibodies were identified in any
patient.
antitumor activity. a total of 23 of 29 patients in arm a
and 24 of 31 patients in arm b were considered evaluable
for response. two patients experienced confirmed partial
responses. the first was observed in a 53-year-old woman
with metastatic melanoma who experienced disease progression while receiving  xxxd1796xxx  chemotherapy prior
to enrollment, initially documented after 3.3 months of
 xxxd2706xxx  treatment at the 200-mg dose level (arm

pharmacokinetics. in preclinical xenograft studies, concentrations of ≥40 mug/ml were achieved at the lower doses
associated with antitumor activity as previously described;
therefore, pharmacokinetic analyses were directed toward
identifying doses capable of achieving these trough concentrations ≥40 mug/ml for subsequent disease-directed
studies.
tables 4 and 5 present pharmacokinetic parameters
from a noncompartmental analysis of the  xxxd2706xxx 
concentration versus time data. in both arms a and b,
the mean  xxxd2706xxx  clearance decreased in a lessthan-dose-proportional manner with dose escalation
from 100 to 1,000 mg. mean clearance for 600/800 mg
of  xxxd2706xxx  (cycle 1) was 20/13 ml/h and 11/6
ml/h (arm a), and 19/15 ml/h and 7/10 ml/h (arm b)
after the first and last infusion, respectively. in addition,
maximum serum concentration (cmax) and area under
the concentration versus time curve extrapolated from
time 0 to infinity (auc0-inf) values increased disproportionately to  xxxd2706xxx . this nonlinear pharmacokinetic behavior suggests a saturable clearance mechanism
(s) in the dose range studied (100-1,000 mg).  xxxd2706xxx  mean clearance was independent of patient body
weight. this suggests that administration of a nonweight
normalized flat dose of  xxxd2706xxx  is appropriate (data
not shown).
target trough concentrations (≥40 mug/ml) were
achieved in all patients treated with  xxxd2706xxx  doses
of 600 mg on both once weekly and every-2-weeks schedules.  xxxd2706xxx  concentration-versus-time profiles

a), and lasted 15.6 months. the patient received a total of
13 cycles of therapy (75 doses), with progression-free survival and overall survival times of 19 and 23 months, respectively. the second partial response was experienced by
a 65-year-old male with metastatic colorectal cancer and
documented following 2.8 months of treatment with  xxxd2706xxx  at the 400-mg dose level (arm b). the patient
had received multiple prior chemotherapy regimens consisting of 5-fluorouracil,  xxxd2462xxx , and oxaliplatin, as
well as  xxxd2868xxx , with a best previous response of stable
disease. the duration of response with  xxxd2706xxx  was
5.6 months. the patient received approximately six cycles
of therapy (17 doses) before developing progressive disease; progression-free survival and overall survival times
were 8.4 and 14.9 months, respectively.
a best overall response of stable disease was observed in
16 patients (8 in each arm). stable disease was most commonly observed in patients with colorectal cancer, with a
best overall response of stable disease in 8 (36.4%) of 22
patients, including 3 of 5 patients treated in the 800-mg
cohort of arm b. seventeen (28%) patients remained alive
and progression free for ≥3 months (9 in arm a and 8 in
arm b) and 9 (15%) for ≥6 months. four patients experienced progression-free survival for ≥9 months.

discussion
 xxxd2706xxx  has been designed to integrate its features so the therapeutic index is more favorable than other
egfr-targeting mabs. to accomplish this,  xxxd2706xxx 
was designed to bind to a specific epitope on the egfr
to maximize blockade of all relevant stimulatory ligands
(1–3). in a wide variety of well-established human tumor
xenografts,  xxxd2706xxx , both as monotherapy and combination therapy, has produced anticancer activity that is
at least comparable with cetuximab, and is superior in several models (16). additionally, as a fully human igg1 construct,  xxxd2706xxx  would not be expected to produce
major hypersensitivity reactions (in contrast to mab constructs that comprise immunogenic murine protein constituents). however,  xxxd2706xxx  would be expected to
confer incremental antitumor activity via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, as shown in an ex vivo assay (16).
based on a retrospective analysis of the pharmacokinetic
behavior of the chimeric egfr-targeting mab cetuximab,
and especially because  xxxd2706xxx  is a fully human
igg1 construct, it was also projected that the pharmacokinetic behavior of  xxxd2706xxx  would support its administration as a flat (unit) dose on an every-2-weeks schedule.

kuenen et al.

in this first-in-man phase i study, treatment with  xxxd2706xxx  at 1,000 mg resulted in two nearly identical dlts,
consisting of grade 3 headache associated with nausea, vomiting, and fever. both the qualitative aspects and temporal onset of these toxicities (i.e., immediately following the
administration of  xxxd2706xxx ) suggest that they were
not related to the principal egfr-targeting mechanism
of  xxxd2706xxx , but were more likely nonspecific manifestations of the administration of relatively high doses of
biological proteins. although both events occurred in patients receiving  xxxd2706xxx  on the weekly schedule, the
fact that they occurred immediately posttreatment indicated that the toxicities were dose related. thus, the dose of
 xxxd2706xxx  was not escalated above 1,000 mg on either
administration schedule. additionally, although there
were some differences in the number of toxicities between
the two schedules, there were no qualitative or significant
quantitative differences in adverse events associated with
weekly and every-2-weeks dosing schedules.
in contrast to the apparently nonspecific nature of the
dose-limiting events in the present study, the most common adverse effect felt to be related to  xxxd2706xxx , dermatologic toxicity, was indeed mechanism related.
dermatologic manifestations, which were similar to those
noted with most small-molecule  xxxg2198xxx  inhibitors
and other mabs targeting the egfr, included acneform
rashes, pruritus, skin fissures, and dry skin. although skin
toxicity related to  xxxd2706xxx  seemed to be dose related
and cumulative, it was generally mild in severity and rarely
resulted in treatment delay exceeding seven days – only
two patients experienced skin toxicity of grade 3 severity.
the cumulative nature of egfr-related skin toxicity renders it difficult to fully characterize its overall frequency,
severity, and tolerance in the phase i setting, because toxicity is not often evaluated in a sufficient number of patients treated over a protracted period in any specific
disease setting. nonetheless, preliminary data from a
phase ii study of  xxxd2706xxx  combined with mfolfox6 chemotherapy in patients with colorectal cancer
in the first-line metastatic setting further support this
preliminary evidence that skin toxicity related to  xxxd2706xxx  is not preclusive, even when administered with
mfolfox6 (19, 20). other toxicities related to  xxxd2706xxx , including nausea, vomiting, and headache,
were manageable and generally of modest frequency
and mild to modest severity. of further note, hypersensitivity was not observed and anti- xxxd2706xxx  antibodies were not detected.
in addition to the toxicity data, various aspects of the
pharmacokinetic behavior of  xxxd2706xxx  support the
selection of its mtd, 800 mg, on an every-2-weeks schedule for subsequent disease-directed evaluations. first, the
minimal target  xxxd2706xxx  trough concentration level
(≥40 mug/ml) was achieved in all patients treated with  xxxd2706xxx  doses of ≥600 mg on both once-weekly and
every-2-weeks schedules. for example, in patients treated
with  xxxd2706xxx  800 mg every 2 weeks, concentrations
at trough (14 days posttreatment and immediately prior to

1922

clin cancer res; 16(6) march 15, 2010

the next treatment) averaged 78 and 83 mug/ml, respectively, after the first and final dose of cycle 1. in essence, mean
serum  xxxd2706xxx  concentrations exceeded biologically
relevant target concentrations by ≥2-fold throughout the
entire treatment period. furthermore, the pharmacokinetic
behavior within the dosing range studied was nonlinear
and saturable. this behavior suggests a situation of “limiting returns” with increasing dose because binding sites are
saturated. finally, a  xxxd2706xxx  flat (unit) dose of 800
mg (every 2 weeks) represents 1.4 and 3.9 times the recommended initial (400 mg/m2) and maintenance dose
(250 mg/m2) of cetuximab on a weekly schedule for 2
weeks, respectively, for a patient with a body surface area
of 1.7 m2. because cetuximab and  xxxd2706xxx  have similar molecular weights and egfr binding affinities, these
relative values suggest that the 800-mg dose of  xxxd2706xxx  provides sufficient “breathing room” over that
achieved with cetuximab at an efficacious dose.
dosing anticancer agents based on body surface area or
body weight has become almost reflexive: it is often universally adopted from the very outset of a drug's development,
despite a lack of evidence in many circumstances that drug
clearance is dependent on these parameters (21–24).  xxxd2706xxx  clearance, albeit dose dependent, behaved independently of body weight, indicating that administration of a flat
(unit) dose is appropriate for administering  xxxd2706xxx .
based on the toxicologic and pharmacologic results of the
present study, a  xxxd2706xxx  dose of 800 mg on either a
weekly or an every-2-weeks schedule is recommended for
disease-directed evaluations, with the selection of schedule
dependent on the clinical situation and scheduling of the
concomitant chemotherapy regimen. preliminary evidence
of objective antitumor activity further supports the biological relevance of  xxxd2706xxx  in the dosing range evaluated
in the present study. nevertheless, although  xxxd2706xxx 
possesses many structural, functional, and pharmacologic
characteristics that might be considered more advantageous
relative to currently available egfr-targeting mabs, its incremental advantage in the clinic can only be elucidated
by carrying out disease-directed clinical evaluations in appropriate patient populations, perhaps guided by the results of molecular correlates of response, as shown in
recent clinical trials of other egfr-targeted therapeutics.

*most common and most severe adverse events (all events of worst grade ≥3 or affecting at least 20% of patients in either arm).
†

treated with  xxxd2706xxx  800 mg every 2 weeks, trough concentrations (14 days
posttreatment and immediately prior to the next treatment) averaged 83 mug/ml
after the final dose of cycle 1,” not “between 78 and 83 mug/ml, respectively, after
the first and final dose of cycle 1.”
