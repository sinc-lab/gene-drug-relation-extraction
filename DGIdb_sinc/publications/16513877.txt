objective: all antipsychotics act on the  xxxg656xxx .
the present study extends prior pharmacogenetic investigations
of the  xxxg656xxx  gene ( xxxg656xxx ) by examining, in first-episode
schizophrenia patients, promoter region variation as a predictor
of response time to two first-line atypical antipsychotics.

method: patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia (n=61) were genotyped for two  xxxg656xxx  promoter region
polymorphisms (a-241g and –141c ins/del) and were randomly
assigned to receive 16 weeks of treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine. time until sustained response (two consecutive ratings without significant positive symptoms) for rare allele carriers versus wild types was examined by using kaplanmeier curves.
results: relative to wild type homozygotes, g carriers (a–
241g) exhibited a significantly faster time until response,
whereas –141c del carriers took a significantly longer time to
respond. diplotype analysis revealed similar results.
conclusions: these findings suggest that variation in the  xxxg656xxx  gene can, in part, explain variation in the timing of clinical response to antipsychotics in patients with first-episode
schizophrenia.

opamine  xxxg656xxx  blockade is a property of all
known antipsychotics (1), yet a predictive relationship between variation in the  xxxg656xxx  gene ( xxxg656xxx )
and medication response has not been clearly established
(2). one possible reason is that long-term treatment with
antipsychotics causes substantial changes (specifically,
up-regulation) in dopamine receptor physiology (3). thus,
treatment studies of patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia may be methodologically advantageous in examining effects of this gene. to date, there has
only been one pharmacogenetic study reported with a
subject group consisting entirely of first-episode patients
(4), which found that genes coding for the d3 and serotonin receptor subtypes were related to symptom reduction
after 10 weeks of naturalistic treatment with a variety of
antipsychotics. however, no association to treatment response was found with the only  xxxg656xxx  polymorphism examined (taq1a). it is important to note that taq1a is actually located downstream from  xxxg656xxx  itself (5), and its
significance to gene expression is unclear.
on the other hand, single nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps) in the 5′ promoter region are likely candidates for
alteration of transcriptional activity (6). two  xxxg656xxx  promoter region snps have been identified: substitution of
guanine for adenine at position –241 (a-241g) and a deletion (versus insertion) of cytosine at position –141 (–141c
ins/del). –141c ins/del has been demonstrated to alter
am j psychiatry 163:3, march 2006

gene expression in vitro (6), and one imaging study in
healthy volunteers showed increased striatal receptor
density in del carriers (7). while one pharmacogenetic
study of this polymorphism has indicated reduced response to chlorpromazine in del carriers (8), other studies
have shown inconsistent results (2). no prior pharmacogenetic studies of this polymorphism have utilized exclusively first-episode patients. further, no published studies
of –141c ins/del have examined response to first-line
atypical agents, time course of response, or effects of the
a-241g polymorphism. the present study was designed to
address these limitations in the context of a randomized
controlled trial of risperidone and olanzapine.

method
subjects were a subset of participants in a clinical trial for patients with first-episode schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
or schizophreniform disorder, comprising the first 61 subjects (45
men and 16 women; mean age=24 years, sd=5, range=16–38) who
provided written informed consent for both the trial and genetic
analyses. most subjects (79%, n=48) were antipsychotic-naive;
none had more than 12 weeks of previous exposure. subjects were
randomly assigned to 16 weeks of treatment with olanzapine
(2.5–20 mg/day, n=28) or risperidone (1–6 mg, n=33).
raters blind to treatment condition and  xxxg656xxx  genotype conducted weekly assessments during the first 4 weeks, then biweekly assessments. response criteria were stringent, requiring
the absence of delusions, hallucinations, or substantial thought
disorder. a rating of 3 (mild) or less, as rated with the schedule for

affective disorders and schizophrenia—change version, was
needed on these items: severity of delusions, severity of hallucinations, impaired understandability, derailment, illogical thinking, and bizarre behavior. in addition, a rating of very much or
much improved on the clinical global impression improvement
scale was required. these criteria were required to be sustained
for two consecutive ratings.
patients were genotyped for a-241g and –141c ins/del by 5′exonuclease fluorescence assay. genotype frequencies were in
hardy-weinberg equilibrium (p>0.39). for data analysis, patients
were dichotomized as homozygous for the wild type allele or as
carriers of the rare allele for each snp (for a–241g: minor allele
frequency=12.3%; for –141c ins/del: minor allele frequency=
32.8%). genotype groups (a/a versus g carriers; ins/ins versus del
carriers) did not differ in terms of sex, diagnosis, or previous treatment (all p>0.42). differences between groups in time to initiation
of sustained response were examined by using kaplan-meier
curves. statistical significance for the two main comparisons was
determined using the false discovery rate method (0.05 level).

results
for each snp, statistically significant differences were
found in time to response to antipsychotic treatment. carriers of the –241g allele showed significantly faster time until
response compared with a/a homozygotes (log-rank=8.40,
df=1, p<0.004) (figure 1). carriers of the –141c del allele
showed significantly longer time to respond relative to ins/
ins homozygotes (log-rank=5.03, df=1, p<0.03) (figure 1).
the two snps were only weakly associated (r2=0.068).
observed diplotype frequencies were as follows: g-ins/gins (3.3%); a-ins/g-ins (13.1%); a-ins/g-del or g-ins/adel (i.e., double heterozygotes, 4.9%); a-ins/a-ins (34.4%);
a-ins/a-del (27.9%); a-del/a-del (16.4%). subjects possessing at least one g allele at a-241g in their diplotype
(n=13) showed relatively high rates of sustained response
(83% met criteria within 16 weeks). subjects with the ains/a-ins diplotype (n=21) were intermediate in their re-

sponse rate (52%), and subjects whose diplotype contained at least one copy of the del allele, but zero copies of
g (n=27) were least likely to respond (30%) (chi2=10.7, df=2,
p=0.002). kaplan-meier survival analysis performed on
these three groups was significant (log-rank=11.38, df=2,
p<0.004) (figure 1). pairwise comparisons indicated a significant difference between the first and third groups (logrank=11.29, df=1, p=0.0008). subjects with the a-ins/a-ins
diplotype tended to have a faster response relative to the
group containing at least one del allele but no g allele in
their diplotype (log-rank=3.70, df=1, p=0.054), but those
with the a-ins/a-ins diplotype did not significantly differ
from subjects whose diplotype contained g (log-rank=
1.97, df=1, p=0.16).
because of ethnic heterogeneity within the group (41%
african american; 28% caucasian (european); 18% hispanic; 5% asian; 8% other), the potential that population
stratification influenced our results was addressed in two
ways. first, there were no significant differences between
ethnic groups on time until response (for all five groups,
p=0.114; for african americans compared with all others,
p=0.204). second, pharmacogenetic analyses were conducted for african american subjects (the largest single
group) alone. results remained significant for –241 g carriers (log-rank=16.41, df=1, p=0.0001) and approached significance for –141c del carriers (log-rank=3.27, df=1, p=
0.07). diplotype analysis remained significant (log-rank=
17.07, df=2, p=0.0002).

discussion
to our knowledge, this is the first report to detect a significant relationship between  xxxg656xxx  genetic variation and
treatment response in first-episode schizophrenia patients. while the association between  xxxg656xxx  promoter ream j psychiatry 163:3, march 2006

brief reports

gion variation and the presence of schizophrenia remains
controversial (9), such an association is not essential to the
phenotype of differential treatment response within a patient group. given prior functional studies of  xxxg656xxx  promoter region variation (6, 7), our findings suggest the possibility that the timing of clinical response may be related
to variation in density or binding potentials of d2 receptors. for example, if del noncarriers have decreased striatal  xxxg656xxx  density, antipsychotics may be more efficient at achieving therapeutic levels of blockade. further
studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of these effects. because of the small study group size, replication is
required to confirm their potential clinical utility.
