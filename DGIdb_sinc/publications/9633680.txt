mechanism of action of dopaminergic agents in parkinson's disease.  as the substantia nigra degenerates in parkinson's disease (pd), the nigrostriatal pathway is disrupted, reducing striatal dopamine and producing pd symptoms. although dopamine does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, its precursor, levodopa, does. levodopa is absorbed in the small bowel and is rapidly catabolized by  xxxg618xxx  ( xxxg618xxx ) and  xxxg487xxx  (comt). because gastric  xxxg618xxx  and comt degrade levodopa, the drug is given with inhibitors of  xxxg618xxx  (carbidopa or benserazide), and inhibitors of comt will also enter clinical use. although the exact site of decarboxylation of exogenous levodopa to dopamine in the brain is unknown, most striatal  xxxg618xxx  is located in nigrostriatal dopaminergic nerve terminals. newly synthesized dopamine is stored in the terminals and then released, stimulating postsynaptic dopamine receptors and mediating the antiparkinsonian action of levodopa. dopamine agonists act directly on postsynaptic dopamine receptors, thus obviating the need for metabolic conversion, storage, and release. how the actions of dopaminergic drugs produce side effects and how these side effects should be managed are discussed.
