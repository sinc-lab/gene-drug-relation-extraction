herg and  xxxg1268xxx /isk, the cardiac k+ channels involved in long qt syndromes, are targets for calcium channel blockers.  we examined the effects of the calcium channel blockers  xxxd2737xxx , diltiazem, verapamil,  xxxd318xxx , and  xxxd2638xxx  on the cloned herg and  xxxg1268xxx /isk k+ channels. these channels generate the rapid and slow components of the cardiac delayed rectifier k+ current, and mutations can affect them, which leads to long qt syndromes. when expressed in transfected cos cells, herg is blocked in a concentration-dependent manner by  xxxd318xxx  (ec50 = 0.55 microm), verapamil (ec50 = 0.83 microm), and  xxxd2638xxx  (ec50 = 1.43 microm), whereas  xxxd2737xxx  and diltiazem have negligible effects. steady state activation and inactivation parameters are shifted to more negative values in the presence of the blockers. similarly,  xxxg1268xxx /isk is inhibited by  xxxd318xxx  (ec50 = 10.0 microm) and  xxxd2638xxx  (ec50 = 11.8 microm), while being insensitive to  xxxd2737xxx , diltiazem, or verapamil. these results demonstrate that both cloned k+ channels herg and  xxxg1268xxx /isk, which represent together the cardiac delayed rectifier k+ current, are sensitive targets to calcium channel blockers. this work may help in understanding the mechanisms of action of verapamil in certain ventricular tachycardia, as well as some of the deleterious adverse cardiac events associated with  xxxd318xxx .
