in vitro effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine
and  xxxd1708xxx  on the circular smooth muscle
of the jejunum of horses
jorge e. nieto, mvz; jack r. snyder, dvm, phd; cynthia kollias-baker, dvm, phd; scott stanley, phd
objective—to determine effects of  xxxd1708xxx  and 5hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) on the jejunum of horses.
sample population—jejunal muscle strips from 8
horses.
procedure—muscle strips were suspended in isolated muscle baths. isometric stress responses to 5-ht
and  xxxd1708xxx , with and without specific antagonists,
were determined.
results—muscle strips incubated with atropine and
tetrodotoxin responded to 5-ht and  xxxd1708xxx  with an
increase in contractile force. the 5-ht caused a concentration-dependent increase in contractile amplitude, with a maximum response (emax) of 1,151 ± 214
g/cm2 and a molar concentration that induces contractile force equal to 50% of maximum response
(ec50) of 0.028 ± 0.002 µm. prior incubation with the
5-ht2 antagonist  xxxd2419xxx  decreased the emax (626
± 147 g/cm2) and potency (ec50, 0.307 ± 0.105 µm) of
5-ht. prior incubation with the 5-ht3 antagonist  xxxd3451xxx  decreased the efficacy (emax, 894 ± 184
g/cm2) to 5-ht.  xxxd1708xxx  also caused a concentrationdependent increase in contractile amplitude, with an
emax of 331 ± 82 g/cm2 and an ec50 of 0.302 ± 0.122
µm. prior incubation with  xxxd2419xxx  decreased the
emax (55 ± 17 g/cm2) and potency (ec50, 0.520 ± 0.274
µm) of  xxxd1708xxx .
conclusion and clinical relevance—stimulatory
effects of 5-ht and  xxxd1708xxx  on circular smooth muscle of equine jejunum are mediated primarily through
a noncholinergic effect. the effects of 5-ht are mediated, at least partially, by 5-ht2 and 5-ht3 receptors,
whereas the effects of  xxxd1708xxx  are mediated primarily by 5-ht2 receptors. this may impact treatment of
horses with postoperative ileus. (am j vet res

p

ostoperative ileus (poi) is a common complication
in horses that undergo abdominal surgery, especially when there is small intestinal distention and inflammation.1-4 in horses, ileus is characterized by a loss of
gastroduodenal coordination and a failure of intestinal
propulsive contractile activity, producing gastric reflux
and intestinal distention with fluid, ingesta, and gas.1
the reported incidence of poi in horses varies from 16
to 43% with a mortality rate as high as 86%.2-4 factors
such as endotoxemia, distention, and inflammation
have been implicated in the development of poi.1,3-5

treatment of horses with poi remains controversial
but has included a number of prokinetic agents.6,7
 xxxd1708xxx , a second-generation substituted benzamide, is a serotonin receptor agonist. unlike metoclopramide,  xxxd1708xxx  lacks antidopaminergic effects and
increases motility in the small and large intestines.8
effects of  xxxd1708xxx  on gastrointestinal motility in horses are not entirely understood, because results depend
on the experimental model used. for example,  xxxd1708xxx  has decreased the incidence of poi in clinical
trials and experimental models in horses.9-12 in other
studies,  xxxd1708xxx  failed to improve gastrointestinal
myoelectrical activity after endotoxin administration;
however, prior treatment with  xxxd1708xxx  attenuated the
delay in gastric emptying caused by endotoxin.13,14
 xxxd1708xxx  also reportedly does not have an effect on
gastric emptying in clinically normal horses.a it has
been proposed that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht)
receptors have an important role in the regulation of
motility of the gastrointestinal tract.15,16 currently, 14 5
ht receptor subtypes have been identified, but the roles
for each subtype in gastrointestinal tract motility have not
been completely determined.17,18 as documented in several in vitro studies, the effects of stimulation of 5-ht
receptors varies depending on the section of the gastrointestinal tract examined and the species involved in
the study.19-22 the purpose of the study reported here
was to determine the effects of  xxxd1708xxx  and 5-ht on
sections of equine jejunum, using an in vitro model.
materials and methods
solutions and reagents—all solutions were prepared
fresh on the day of the experiment. modified krebs-ringer
buffer (krb) solution contained 110 mm nacl, 4.6 mm kcl,
2.5 mm cacl2, 24.8 mm nahco3, 1.2 mm kh2po4, 1.2 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , and 5.6 mm glucose, and ph was adjusted between
7.3 and 7.4 when equilibrated with 95% o2-5% co2.
selective 5-ht receptor antagonists  xxxd2419xxx ,b troprisetron,c and sdz-205,557 hydrochlorided (receptor antagonists for 5-ht2, 5-ht3, and  xxxg1117xxx , respectively) were dissolved in distilled water. tetrodotoxin (ttx),e 5-ht, and
atropinef were dissolved in distilled water, and acetylcholine
(ach)g was dissolved in krb solution. cisaprideh was dissolved in a 0.1% solution of lactic acid and diluted (1:9) with
distilled water. the concentration of lactic acid in the organ
bath did not alter ph of the krb solution, and the same concentrations of lactic acid did not have an effect on control
strips. all substances were dissolved to make a stock solution
of 10-2m or 10-3m.
collection and preparation of samples—tissues were
obtained from horses ranging from 3 to 15 years old. horses
did not have gastrointestinal tract disorders or systemic disease, as determined on the basis of results of physical examination and cbc and evaluation of the intestines at the time

of collection. horses were euthanatized by an iv injection of
an overdose of sodium pentobarbital. full segments from the
distal aspect of the jejunum were collected immediately after
horses were euthanatized. ingesta was removed by washing
the lumen with krb solution, after which the tissues were
placed in cold oxygenated krb solution. all samples were
processed on the same day that they were collected.
segments of tissue were pinned flat, mucosa side down, in a
dissecting dish containing oxygenated krb solution. fullthickness muscle strips (2 x 10 mm) were cut parallel to the
circular muscle fibers, and the mucosa and submucosa were
removed, using a dissecting microscope. muscle strips were
suspended in organ baths containing 20 ml of warm (37 c)
krb solution continuously bubbled with a mixture of 95%
o2-5% co2. the distal end of each strip was attached to a
glass hook tissue support, and the proximal part was
attached to an isometric force transducer. after being allowed
to equilibrate for 90 minutes, the length for optimal force
development was determined by increasing the length of
each muscle strip in 1-mm increments until the maximal
active contractile response to 10-4m ach was achieved. the
ach then was removed by use of fresh warm (37 c) krb
solution, and muscle strips were allowed to stabilize until
spontaneous regular phasic contractile activity returned
(baseline).
isometric force was recorded, using force transducersi
connected by a grass transducer cablej to an 8-channel polygraph chart recorder.k data were recorded and analyzed,
using a statistical software package.l
effect of ttx and atropine on response to  xxxd1708xxx 
and 5-ht—after incubation for 20 minutes with 1 µm ttx
and atropine, muscle strips were stimulated with a single
dose of 10 µm ach. separate muscle strips were incubated
with 1 µm ttx and 1 µm atropine for 20 minutes. after the
20-minute incubation, muscle strips were stimulated with a
single dose of 1 µm 5-ht or 1 µm  xxxd1708xxx , and responses
were recorded for a period of 9 minutes.
effect of 5-ht antagonists on response to 5-ht or  xxxd1708xxx —muscle strips were incubated with vehicle (control
strips) or 1 of the following 5-ht receptor subtype selective
antagonists: 0.2 µm  xxxd2419xxx  ( xxxg1113xxx 
antagonist), 3 µm  xxxd3451xxx  ( xxxg1116xxx  antagonist), or
10 µm sdz-205,557 hydrochloride ( xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist). after a 20-minute incubation with the antagonist or
vehicle, increasing concentrations of 5-ht (0.001 to 100 µm)
or  xxxd1708xxx  (0.05 to 10 µm) were added to the tissue bath at
3-minute intervals.
data analysis—the active contractile force was adjusted for cross-sectional area. at the end of the experiments, the
length and dry weight of each strip were obtained. cross-sectional area was calculated, assuming a tissue density of 1.056
g/cm3 and using the following formula described elsewhere23:
area = mass/(density x length). all values were expressed as
mean ± sem. statistical analysis was performed, using a  xxxd1614xxx  anova followed by the fisher least significant difference test. significance was set at a value of p < 0.05. the
maximum response (emax) and molar concentration that
induces contractile force equal to 50% of emax (ec50) were
calculated, using simple regression analysis.

strips obtained from 4 horses). strips were incubated with
tetrodotoxin (ttx) and atropine for 20 minutes before addition of
5-ht or  xxxd1708xxx . atropine and ttx decreased the amplitude of
spontaneous contractions, whereas 5-ht and, to a lesser
degree,  xxxd1708xxx  increased contractile amplitude.

amplitude was not elicited (15 ± 5 g/cm2). thus, ttx
and atropine inhibited cholinergically mediated contractions in equine jejunum. separate muscle strips
incubated with atropine and ttx for 20 minutes
responded with an increase in the contractile force of
2,536 ± 301 g/cm2 and 316 ± 136 g/cm2 after a single
dose (1 µm) of 5-ht or  xxxd1708xxx , respectively (fig 1).

for 5-ht and  xxxd1708xxx  after addition of 5-ht2, 5-ht3,
and  xxxg1117xxx  antagonists were determined (table 1).
addition of 5-ht caused a concentration-dependent increase in active isometric stress properties of
circular smooth muscle in equine jejunum (fig 2). the

discussion
analysis of results of the study reported here
revealed that several 5-ht receptor subtypes may be
important in regulating motility in the equine jejunum.
it is unlikely that the effects of 5-ht and  xxxd1708xxx  on
equine jejunum observed in this study are mediated by
cholinergic receptors, because muscarinic receptors
had been inactivated by prior incubation with ttx and
atropine. these results are consistent with those of in
vitro studies performed by use of similar preparations
on tissues obtained from guinea pigs and rats.24,25
comparing the ec50 values obtained for  xxxd1708xxx  and
5-ht, it is evident that with regard to the circular
smooth muscle of the equine jejunum, 5-ht is approximately 10 times more potent than  xxxd1708xxx . in a similar manner for comparing the maximum response in
this model, 5-ht caused an almost 4-fold higher
response than  xxxd1708xxx . analysis of these results indicated that  xxxd1708xxx  may only be a partial agonist at 5ht receptors.
the effects of  xxxd1708xxx  reportedly are mediated by
at least 2 pathways: a cholinergic neuronally dependent contraction and a noncholinergic neuronally
independent contraction.26 in the study reported here,
only a noncholinergic neuronally independent effect of
 xxxd1708xxx  was observed.
analysis of results of our study indicated that  xxxd1708xxx  acts in the equine jejunum, at least in part,
through stimulation of 5-ht2 receptors, because incubation with the specific 5-ht2 antagonist  xxxd2419xxx 
decreased the stimulatory effects of  xxxd1708xxx . in our
study,  xxxd1708xxx  induced a concentration-dependent
increase in the contractile amplitude of equine
jejunum. at the highest dose tested (10 µm), however,
 xxxd1708xxx  actually inhibited contraction. similar
responses have been described in guinea pigs.24,27,28 this
inhibitory response suggests that receptors for  xxxd1708xxx  may consist of high-affinity stimulatory sites
and low-affinity inhibitory sites, or it may indicate that
1563

20965r.qxd

10/24/2005

11:12 am

page 1564

 xxxd1708xxx  may be auto-inhibitory.24,27,28 however, in our
study, the concentration of  xxxd1708xxx  that induced inhibition in the tissue bath was 20 times higher than the
peak plasma concentration obtained after iv injection
of a therapeutic dose of  xxxd1708xxx  (0.1 mg/kg of body
weight) in clinically normal horses.29 usually, concentrations of that magnitude are not considered physiologically relevant, because cells are never exposed to
concentrations that great; therefore, the inhibition
observed may not be relevant in a live animal.
results of studies performed on ileum obtained
from guinea pigs documented that  xxxd1708xxx  acts on 5ht4 and 5-ht3 receptors.30,31 more recent reports of
studies in guinea pigs and dogs indicate that  xxxd1708xxx 
may act on 5-ht1, 5-ht2, and motilin receptors.32,33 in
contrast to guinea pig ileum, a nonserotonergic mechanism also has been identified in the antrum of dogs.21
in horses, it appears that the role of  xxxg1117xxx  receptor is
not part of an important mechanism of action for  xxxd1708xxx , because prior incubation with the  xxxg1117xxx  receptor antagonist sdz205–557 did not result in a significant decrease in the contractile amplitude elicited by
 xxxd1708xxx . when results of our study are compared
with results of similar studies in other species, there
appears to be wide variation in the mechanism of
action for  xxxd1708xxx .
the effect and receptor involved in the response to
5-ht depends on the species and portion of intestine
studied. intravenous and intraarterial administration
of 5-ht in conscious animals stimulates small intestinal contractions.34,35 this increase in motor activity is
accompanied by a net secretion of water and electrolytes. in addition, intestinal peristaltic reflexes are
initiated by release of 5-ht from enterochromaffin
cells.36 in an in vitro study in rat ileum,25 the response
to 5-ht was most likely mediated by the  xxxg1113xxx  located in smooth muscle. in the jejunum of conscious dogs, however, 5-ht stimulates phasic contractions and phase-iii activity by acting on 5-ht2a and 5ht2c receptor subtypes located on postsynaptic
cholinergic neurons.34 in that same study, stimulation
of  xxxg1117xxx  receptors in the jejunum of conscious dogs
suppressed the amplitude and duration of phase-iii
activity.34 in the colon, several studies have documented that the response to exogenous 5-ht and the 5-ht
receptor subtypes that mediate the response depends
on the species. for example, in rabbits, dogs, and
guinea pigs, 5-ht induces contractions, which are
mediated by 5-ht1 (rabbits), 5-ht1, 5-ht2, and 5-ht3
(dogs), and 5-ht1, 5-ht3, and  xxxg1117xxx  (guinea
pigs).19,22,32,33,36-38 in human, canine, and guinea pig
colon, however, 5-ht causes relaxation, which is
mediated via the 5-ht1-like and  xxxg1117xxx  receptors
(humans),  xxxg1113xxx  (guinea pigs), and  xxxg1117xxx 
receptor (dogs).19,20,32
in our study, the incubation of muscle strips with
5-ht2 or 5ht3 antagonists decreased the contractile
response to 5-ht, indicating that these receptor subtypes may mediate, at least in part, the response of
equine jejunum to 5-ht. furthermore, the 5-ht2
antagonist decreased the maximum response to 5-ht
and displaced the concentration-response curve to the
right, acting as a noncompetitive antagonist. the 51564

ht3 antagonist troprisetron decreased the 5-ht contractile response at the lower concentrations used. in
addition, troprisetron at low concentrations is a 5-ht3
antagonist but functions as a  xxxg1117xxx  antagonist at higher concentrations.39,40 in our study, however, incubation
with a specific 5ht4 antagonist did not have an effect
on contractions elicited by 5-ht. therefore, the
decreased response to 5-ht induced by troprisetron
was most likely mediated by blockade of 5-ht3 receptors and was not the result of antagonism of  xxxg1117xxx 
receptors.
with the variation in receptor population and
activity observed in our study and other studies, it is
clear that these types of studies should be performed in
horses and cannot be extrapolated from other species
or other regions of the gastrointestinal tract. because of
the multifactorial nature of poi in horses, effects of
various prokinetic agents in tissue under differing
stimuli such as distention, ischemia, or endotoxemia
should be examined to enable researchers to make specific suggestions about the best treatment options for
clinically affected horses.
