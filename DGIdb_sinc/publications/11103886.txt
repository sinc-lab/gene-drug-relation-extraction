patients with schizophrenia show impairments of attention and neuropsychological performance, but the extent to which
this is attributable to antipsychotic medication remains largely unexplored. we describe here the putative influence of the
dose of antipsychotic medication (chlorpromazine equivalents, cpz), the antipsychotic serum concentration of dopamine
(da) d 2-blocking activity and the approximated central dopamine d 2-receptor occupancy (da d 2-occupancy), on
conditioned blocking (cb) measures of attention and performance on a neuropsychological battery, in 108 patients with
schizophrenia (compared with 62 healthy controls). antipsychotic serum concentration and d 2-occupancy were higher in
patients with a paranoid versus non-paranoid diagnosis, and in female versus male patients (independent of symptom
severity). controlling for d 2-occupancy removed the difference between high cb in paranoid and impaired low cb in
non-paranoid patients. similar partial correlations for antipsychotic drug dose and serum levels of da d 2-blocking
activity with performance of the trail-making and picture completion tests (negative) and the block-design task (positive)
showed the functional importance of da-related activity. high estimates of central da d 2-occupancy were related to
impaired verbal fluency but were associated with improved recall of stories, especially in paranoid patients. this, the first
study of its kind, tentatively imputes a role for da d 2-related activity in left frontal (e.g. cb, verbal fluency) and temporal
lobe functions (verbal recall) as well as in some non-verbal abilities mediated more in the right hemisphere in patients
with schizophrenia. 䊚 2000 lippincott williams & wilkins.

introduction
schizophrenia is an illness conventionally treated
with drugs that primarily block the dopamine žda.
d 2 receptor. many patients with schizophrenia are
impaired in performing cognitive tasks requiring
selective attention že.g. latent inhibition žli. and
conditioned blocking žcb.. and neuropsychological
tests of frontal or temporal lobe function že.g. verbal
fluency, card-sorting, logical memories: straube and
oades, 1992..
performance in healthy subjects is more easily
disrupted by stimulation of da activity by amphetamine on some of these tasks than on others
že.g. li versus cb: gray et al., 1992 versus gray et
0955-8810 䊚 2000 lippincott williams & wilkins

al., 1997.. but the impairments of these tasks in
patients with schizophrenia are also associated with
different features of the illness, such as the nature
of the symptoms expressed and the duration of the
illness. for example, li impairments are associated
with florid symptoms and dissipate with illness duration žgray et al., 1995.; in contrast, the cb impairment depends on non-paranoid features and is independent of the length of illness že.g. oades et al.,
1996b; bender et al., 2000.. however, it is difficult to
distinguish between the contribution of the illness to
task performance and that due to the medication.
most studies of the potential effects of antipsychotic drugs on the variables studied rely on convertbehavioural pharmacology 2000, vol 11 nos 3 & 4 317

oades et al.

ing the dose administered to a standard. the standard refers to the efficacy in reducing clinical symptoms and is usually expressed in terms of chlorpromazine equivalents žcpz.. however, the reliability
of such data for antipsychotic drugs is compromised
by four types of uncertainty. first, there is the uncertainty of compliance, that the medication was
indeed consumed. secondly, there are large pharmacokinetic fluctuations between individuals. the
inter-individual bioavailability of the antipsychotic
drug ži.e. the serum concentration . may vary more
than fortyfold due to the high variation of resorption, metabolism and elimination. thirdly, there are
considerable pharmacodynamic variations between
the effects of the various antipsychotic drugs že.g. in
the antipsychotic effect as well as the disinhibition
of prolactin release; bagli et al., 1999.. finally, there
is the likelihood that measures of clinical efficacy
reflect antipsychotic actions on transmitters other
than da.
in this paper we describe how these sources of
error can be circumvented. we show how data on
the doses of the antipsychotic drugs administered
and on their bioavailability can be used to elucidate
the contribution of da d 2-receptor antagonism to
cb measures of selective attention abilities and
neuropsychological tasks reflecting frontal, parietal
and temporal lobe function. this paper focuses on
paranoid versus non-paranoid schizophrenia, as this
distinction differentiates patients’ attentional abilities measured by cb, and their likelihood to respond
to neuroleptic medication.
the procedure starts with the determination of
the serum concentrations of antipsychotic drugs in
terms of their da d 2-receptor-blocking activity. this
is achieved by an in vitro radioreceptor assay that
quantifies the da d 2-receptor-blocking activity in
serum in terms of haloperidol displacement from an
aliquot of rat striatal tissue. the data from this assay
correlate linearly with data obtained by chemical
methods že.g. high performance liquid chromatography: rao, 1986.. in one step this procedure identifies compliant patients and standardizes betweenpatient and between-drug variability in terms of da
d 2-binding activity.
further, as most antipsychotic drugs are lipophilic
and cross the blood᎐brain barrier easily, the data on
antipsychotic drug dose can be used to estimate
central da d 2-receptor occupancy. this relationship is described in a number of positron emission
tomographic žpet. studies. we performed regression analyses on these pet data and report on the
relationship to our data on the bioavailability of da
d 2-binding activity in serum žneuroleptic units, nu.
318 behavioural pharmacology 2000, vol 11 nos 3 & 4

and the antipsychotic drug dose žcpz.. in this
article we describe the relation of these three
medication-related parameters žcpz, nu and d 2occupancy. to our measures of psychological test
performance.
predictions of what this analysis should show in
terms of the influence of antipsychotic drugs depend
on two opposing views of how the da d 2-blocking
activity should be interpreted. on the one hand,
high levels of antipsychotic-drug-binding activity
could imply that more sites were occupied by the
ligand as more sites were available than were occupied by da: da activity must be low. on the other
hand, for the da d 2 receptor, high levels of binding
sites can be built up to reflect high levels of da
release. in addition to this, even low concentrations
of antipsychotic drug will occupy synaptic da d 2binding sites and interrupt the normal negative feedback circuit between synaptic levels of da and da
release. this leads to an upregulation of the da d 2
receptor that reflects a lack of presynaptic control of
da release.
our predictions are based on the latter of these
two interpretations. the results may be taken as a
test between the two proposed mechanisms. first,
there is a widespread belief that da d 2-related
binding may be increased in schizophrenia: this may
be more marked in those exhibiting positive symptoms and underlies their responsiveness to neuroleptic treatment žstraube and oades, 1992, pp. 604᎐605;
seeman, 1997.. although direct evidence is sparse
on this issue, we would predict increased d 2occupancy in patients with a diagnosis of paranoid
schizophrenia žwith positive symptoms. and less
binding in those without these symptoms, reflecting
hypodopaminergic function. secondly, in animals,
healthy humans and patients with schizophrenia, cb
varies with da activity žoades et al., 1987, 1996a, b..
thus it would be expected that either correlations of
cb with d 2-binding should be evident, or controlling
for the differences of d 2-binding between subgroups
of patients would abolish differences in cb reported
for paranoid and non-paranoid patients. thirdly,
with regard to neuropsychological test performance,
we would predict a differential relationship for d2occupancy with functions dependent on frontal versus those dependent on temporal lobe function. this
is based on the view that treatment with atypical
neuroleptics contributes more to the improvement
of cognitive function dependent on the frontal lobes
že.g. verbal fluency. than to improvement of memory, dependent more on temporal lobe function
žmeltzer and mcgurk, 1999.. the muscarinic binding potential of atypical neuroleptics may be the

dopamine-d2 , neuropsychology and schizophrenia

factor hindering an improvement of memory performance. thus one could expect a relationship to
appear between memory task performance and cpz
measures of antipsychotic drug administered, as this
measure would reflect both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic activity in the treatment.
methods
subjects

from 108 patients with schizophrenia, 107 were presented with a neuropsychology test battery. of these,
101 attempted the conditioned blocking žcb. task,
and 62 learned the task well enough to allow a
comparison with the performance of 62 healthy subjects, group-matched for age, years spent in education and socio-economic background žtable 1..
informed and signed consent was obtained from
each patient, their responsible care-givers and the
controls. the protocol was approved by the ethics
committee of the university of essen, medical faculty. patients were recruited from child, adolescent
and adult psychiatry clinics and initial diagnosis was
made by the senior psychiatrist. these patients were
re-examined for entry to the study by two senior

psychiatrists of the research group žs.b. and j.w.:
dsm-iv, criteria a᎐e, american psychiatric association, 1994.. affective, schizo-affective and
schizophreniform psychoses were excluded. additionally, patients were screened to exclude other
major psychiatric or somatic illness, alcohol abuse in
the past 5 years, and substance abuse other than
nicotine. schizophrenia subtypes were defined by
dsm-iv criteria, whereby the undifferentiated type
was regarded as a residual category that contrasts
with the paranoid, disorganised and catatonic subtypes žfor clinical assessments and medication, see
table 1..
symptoms were rated on the positive and negative syndrome scale žpanss: kay et al., 1992. and,
as ideas-of-reference and thought disorder are
under-represented in this scale, the relevant items
15᎐19 and 26᎐32 from the scale for assessment of
positive symptoms žsaps: andreasen and olsen,
1982. were also scored. clinical ratings included the
scales for extrapyramidal symptoms žsimpson᎐angus
scale: simpson and angus, 1970., and the abnormal
involuntary movement scale žaims..

between illness onset and testing žrange 0.02᎐20.1
years.. the duration of the current admission to the
clinic ranged from 1 to 211 days. antipsychotic drugs
were administered to the patients according to the
clinical requirements and the dose was normalized
to chlorpromazine equivalents žcpz. according to
benkert and hippius ž1986., rey et al. ž1989., schulz
et al. ž1989., kane ž1996., and correspondence with
the firms supplying olanzapine and  xxxd3195xxx . of
107 patients entering the study, two male patients
were without medication at the time of testing, 49
ž63% male. were administered typical antipsychotic
drug medication, 43 ž67% male. received atypical
medication žclozapine and olanzapine., and 15 ž47%

received typical, 25 versus 18 received atypical and
11 versus 4 received both types of medication. fourteen patients received biperidene žmean, 3.9 mg;
range, 2᎐8 mg; table 1..
the 62 healthy subjects were recruited by advertisement and were paid for participation. the selection controlled for socio-economic distribution and
age among the patients: gender ratios were not
significantly different žtable 1.. the exclusion criteria for healthy subjects, based on a semi-structured interview, were the same as those described
for the patients. in addition they reported no family
history of psychotic illness, nor had they previously
consulted with a psychiatrist or psychologist.
the conditioned blocking (cb) test of selective attention

cb refers to the delay in learning about the consequences of a stimulus-component žb in ab. when
these consequences are already becoming associated
with another component ža in ab.. in other words,
attending to and conditioning to the one component
is said to be ‘blocked’ by attending to and conditioning to the other žkamin, 1969.. this ‘blocking’ is
evident in healthy subjects in the delayed response
to component b žwith respect to that to a. when the
components are presented separately at the end of
the task in a test of learning. this ‘blocking’ is
normal because as the learning criterion of response
to ab is approached, responding becomes more
automatic. with the presentation of a single component when testing for the learning that has occurred
about each component, information processing must
320 behavioural pharmacology 2000, vol 11 nos 3 & 4

be switched back to a controlled conscious mode, as
was evident at the start of conditioning.
the cb task was introduced as a computer game.
a cursor could be moved with a joystick through a
maze resembling the floor-plan of an apartment
žfigure 1.. subjects could start from the left or right
sides of the maze and were asked to find a goal in
the other room with the cursor ži.e. two goal loci in
mirror image positions.. on reaching the goal, the
locus turned pale yellow and 30 points were awarded
on counters below the maze. every second beyond a
latency of 8 seconds was scored with y1 point per
second. such trials were scored as ‘errors’ for the
calculation of the learning criterion. the inter-trialinterval was 2 seconds. skilled subjects learned to
reach the goal in about 2.4 seconds.
in practice, to achieve a reasonable information
load two such discrimination tasks, each with a different goal-locus, were run at the same time, in
pseudo-random order. the cue for starting a trial
and for association with the correct goal locus consisted of colour-panels located above the floor-plan
for 2 seconds at the start of each trial žfigure 1.. cb
requires that during learning a stimulus is added
že.g. b to a.. thus on such a ‘blocking session’ two
colour-panels žs a. were presented up to a learning criterion of 5r8 correct responses, when a third
colour-panel žb. was added up to full acquisition
ž7r8 correct.. but ‘blocking’ can only be judged by
reference to response latencies acquired when all
three panels were present from the beginning. thus
a second ‘reference session’, with three different
colour panels present from the start of learning, was
also administered. counter-balancing our initial
study žoades et al., 1996b., the reference session
here followed the blocking session on the next day,
for controls and patients alike. žthe success of the
replication shows that the order of presentation did
not contribute to the cb effect..
what was the measure of cb used? after achieving the learning criterion, there was a sequence of
12 test trials, consisting of single presentations of
the colours that had appeared on the left or the
right of the panel arrays during the learning phase.
subtraction of the latency of response to the ‘added’
colour-panel from that for the other panel present
from the start of learning gave the within-session
‘blocking’ score. subtraction of the similar value
obtained on the ‘reference session’ žright panel
minus left panel latency. from those on the ‘blocking session’ gave the actual cb scores used. thus
the ‘first trial’ test measure represents a double
subtraction procedure žderived stimulus latencies:
wright panel ᎏ left panelx blocking ᎏ wright panel ᎏ

dopamine-d2 , neuropsychology and schizophrenia

left panelx reference .. we report cb data as the derived
latencies for the first ‘trial-pair’ measure that represents the mean of the double-subtraction procedures
for the first test trials of each of the two discriminations.
neuropsychological tasks

the battery consisted of 10 neuropsychological tasks.
the ¨ erbal fluency test žbenton and hamsher, 1989.
requires the generation of as many words as possible
starting with the letter f, a or s ž1 minute each.. in
the trail-making test žtmt. subjects are asked to
join up in sequence first a series of numbers žform
a., then an alternating series of letters and numbers
žform b, e.g. 1-a-2-b-3, where the score used is the
latency b ᎏ a; reitan, 1958.. both tests are thought
to reflect functions in the frontal lobe. the stroop
test interference score is the increased latency to
name the print colour of a word that names a
different colour, compared to the latencies to name
colours and words naming colours. this reflects
functions centred on the cingulate cortex. the following two tests reflect broadly parietal function.
the block-design test requires that a given pattern in
the form of a square is reconstructed out of 4 or 9
pieces, in 1 or 2 minutes, respectively žwechsler,
1981.. the modified mooney faces closure test re-

quires the classification of the age of degraded
images of faces žmooney and ferguson, 1951;
lansdell, 1970.. as a reflection of temporo-parietal
function, the picture-completion test asks the subject
to mark the missing feature on a picture of an
everyday scene že.g. a handle on a door: wechsler,
1981.. visual reproduction and logical memories were
tested in the immediate- and delayed-recall forms
ži.e. with zero or 30 min delays: wechsler, 1987.. a
series of visual patterns or two short stories are
presented for recall, and reflect right- and left-sided
temporal lobe function in the areas of visuospatial
and verbal memory, respectively. in addition, the
short 12-item form of the ad¨ anced progressi¨ e
matrices žapm. was used as a measure of iq, where
scores of less than 6 are below, and scores of 12 are
above, average žraven, 1976.. each item presents a
choice of six patterns for matching the part missing
from a probe pattern. handedness was scored for 12
activities that are usually lateralized according to the
edinburgh inventory žoldfield, 1971: q24 for rightand y24 for left handedness..

10 min at 2000 g and the serum stored at y70⬚c
until analysis. the antipsychotic drug level in serum
was estimated according to rao ž1986., with a
radioreceptor assay technique using w 3 hxspiroperidol
as ligand with increasing concentrations of haloperidol, and a da d 2-receptor preparation from the
striatum of pigs. the result was expressed as da
d 2-receptor antagonist binding activity in relation to
the haloperidol standard in neuroleptic units žnu..
one neuroleptic unit was defined as the extent of
displacement produced by 100 ␮ l of serum containing haloperidol at a concentration of 1 nmolrml
ž0.37 ng..
the lower limit of detection for antipsychotic drugs
že.g. haloperidol. in serum was 1 nu ž0.37 ngrml..
the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation
were 5% and 8%, respectively. a regression analysis
for the relation between the serum da d 2-receptor
antagonist binding activity and the concentration of
the antipsychotic drugs gave correlations varying
between 0.7 and 0.9. thus the serum da d 2-receptor antagonist binding activity may be regarded as
representative of the antipsychotic serum concentration normalized as neuroleptic units, and is a measure of the bioavailability of the drug. as a rule,
when patients are in a steady state with regard to
their antipsychotic medication, the intra-patient
variation of the serum antipsychotic concentration
yields a coefficient of variation of 10᎐15%, that is
thus considered to be rather stable. in the following
analyses, medication data žcpz, nu, d 2-occupancy.
were only considered from subjects proven to have
taken medication by a positive serum nu value. this
resulted in dropping nine non-compliant patients
from the analyses.
central da d 2-receptor occupancy was inferred
from the antipsychotic dose versus d 2-receptor occupancy, as reported in the literature žtable 2.. a
linear regression analysis was performed separately
for each drug, relating dose to occupancy. thus, the
approximate percentage occupancy for a given dose

was computed from the occupancy regression line
žsee examples for haloperidol and clozapine in figure 2.. occupancy could not be calculated for drugs
for which there were no published pet data žpet
data were not available at the time the regression
analyses were calculated for the following antipsychotic drugs that were administered to at least one
patient: bromperidol,  xxxd1679xxx , fluphenazine,
 xxxd2474xxx , perazine, promethazine, sulpiride,
 xxxd3195xxx  and zotepine.. there are too few published data available to enable direct computations
of d 2-receptor occupancy from antipsychotic serum
levels. occupancy data were available from 76
patients žtable 3..
statistical analyses

group data were analysed with respect to measures
of cb, neuropsychological performance, antipsychotic drug dose, serum level and da d 2-occupancy,
by multivariate analysis of variance. for taskperformance, iq and age were entered as covariates.
these analyses are known to be robust in the face of
violations of homogeneous data distributions. while
cpz measures showed a normal distribution in the
range 1᎐1700 ž ␹ 2 s 1.35, p s 0.72, kolmogorov᎐
smirnov d s 0.075., the antipsychotic serum levels

consideration of typical drugs ž n s 29., or even
risperidone alone ž n s 12., did not show a significant relationship. reasons for this initially surprising
result probably reflect the interaction of two features. the normalized measures of the daily drug
dose žcpz. are based on the relationship between
the clinically effective dose and measures of the
half-saturation of the da d 2 receptor. but as shown
in figure 2 žleft. there is a ceiling effect for the
relationship between central d 2-occupancy and the
frequently administered dose of antipsychotic drug
že.g. a dose of only 6 mgrday haloperidol results in
80% saturation of central d 2 receptors.. this introduces considerably more error into the relationship
between d 2-occupancy and clinical efficacy than is
evident in the relation for clozapine, shown on the
right of the figure. none the less, we decided to
combine the data from all patients in the current,
first analyses of the relationships of each medication-related parameter with the measures of behavioural performance.
patient-group differences in antipsychotic drug dose
(cpz), antipsychotic serum concentration (nu) and
central da d 2-receptor occupancy

a division of the patients according to a diagnosis of
paranoid versus non-paranoid schizophrenia showed
that those with a paranoid diagnosis had a significantly higher level of central d 2-occupancy ž19%.
than those with non-paranoid diagnoses žb in table
3.. this difference was not reflected either in the
dose or the serum level of antipsychotic drug activity. žthese groups did not differ significantly in the
panss ratings of positive, negative or general symptoms..

patients with high scores for symptoms of ideasof-reference and thought disorder tended to receive
higher doses of medication žf in table 3., but there
was no evidence of differences in serum or central
measures. however, patients who did not learn the
cb task adequately showed higher circulating levels
of antipsychotic d 2-binding activity žg in table 3.. it
is striking that female patients, independent of the
subgroup diagnosis, usually showed higher levels of
both serum antipsychotic activity and central d 2occupancy ža, c, d, e, h in table 3..
schizophrenia: subgroups and cb

analysis of the 62 patients who learned the cb task
with a two-way manova, with age and iq as
covariates, showed impaired cb for non-paranoid
patients with respect to those with a diagnosis of
paranoid schizophrenia wq3.1, sd 7.5, versus y1.1,
sd 7.3: fž2,53. s 3.5, p - 0.025x. this impairment
dissipated with learning across test presentations
wrepeated trials analysis, fž2,108. s 5.2, p - 0.05:
bender et al., 2000x.
regression analyses for the contribution of medication-related parameters to cb did not obtain conventional levels of significance for either the patient
group as a whole nor the paranoid subgroup. for the
11 non-paranoid patients with an adequate cb performance and a full set of medication-related measures, increases of d 2-occupancy related to decreases of cb žpartial correlation s y0.73, p 0.02.. in contrast, increasing serum concentrations
of d 2-binding activity related to the recovery of cb

small wfž3,7. s 4.3 and 9.3, p - 0.05 and 0.01,
r 2 s 0.65 and 0.80, respectivelyx, the result is tentative. thus the manova analysis of cb was repeated for the whole patient group, using central
d 2-receptor occupancy as a covariate. this procedure removed the significance of the result žoneway analyses, f s 5.1 versus 2.0.. as the use of the
antipsychotic dose or serum levels did not affect the
analysis, it may be concluded that the degree of
central da d 2-occupancy contributed to the variance of cb.
schizophrenia subgroups: neuropsychology

group comparisons showed that patients were impaired significantly with respect to controls on 8 of
the 10 neuropsychological tests ži.e. not the mooney
faces and stroop interference tasks: oades et al.,
2000.. antipsychotic dose, serum levels and central
d 2-receptor occupancy were entered into standard
regressions to identify the influences of the medication parameters on the performance differences.
relationships of the antipsychotic dose žcpz. with
psychological test performance would be expected to
reflect the effects of the drug as a dopaminergic antagonist on da d 2-binding sites and its
influences on the activity in other transmitter systems že.g. anticholinergic activity of atypical
neuroleptic drugs: such influences can be inferred by
a difference in the sign of the relationship of the
medication parameters with the performance of specific tasks, table 5.. only the influences that reflect
specifically da bioavailability should be seen in the

relationships with serum levels of da d 2-binding
activity and central d 2-receptor occupancy. dopaminergic effects on performance were evident, as a
number of significant linear regression analyses were
found for the entire patient group with each
medication-related parameter. the specificity of the
relationships to subgroups of patients was explored
and only the significant results are listed in tables 4
and 5.
the regression results in table 4 showed that, of
the variance in neuropsychological performance explained by da-related parameters, most was attributable to the measures of serum neuroleptic
units žnu. and central da d 2-occupancy ž28᎐29%..
the additional variance explained by the drug dose
žcpz., which may include some non-da-related
activity, was small žup to a total of 34%.. with
regard to the subgroups, regression analyses for the
non-paranoid patients produced no significant results. for the patients with a paranoid diagnosis, the
similarity of r 2 for the dose žcpz. and the serum
levels of antipsychotic drugs žnu. suggests that darelated activity was important for their neuropsychological performance. analyses for patients divided by
a median split on the ratings of ideas-of-reference or
thought disorder varied with respect to whether the
high or low scores showed significant relationships:
compare the r 2 žhigh ior. of 52.6% for nu with
the r 2 žlow ior. of 46.3% for d 2-occupancy. this
characteristic, along with the near significant results
obtained for groups rated on both sides of the
median, suggests that divisions according to these

symptom parameters did not show an important
dichotomy of the influences of medication-related
activity.
a comparison of the partial correlations for test
performance with the medication-related parameters in table 5 shows three results. first, it should
be noted that the partial correlations between a
medication parameter and performance on specific
tasks are consistent in their direction of correlation
from the patient group as a whole across the patient
subgroups in the table. secondly, as discussed above,
similarities in the direction of the correlation
between the medication parameters že.g. cpz and
nu. are consistent with an interpretation in terms
of a da influence že.g. negative for tmt b ᎐ a and
picture completion, but positive for block design.. in
contrast, a difference in sign of the correlation že.g.
for mooney faces and immediate visual reproduction
for cpz versus d2-occupancy. suggests that there
are separate influences mediated by da and by
non-da activity. lastly, a unique result is the negative relationship of verbal fluency and the positive
relationship of delayed logical memories with d 2-re-

ceptor occupancy žtable 5, bottom.. these correlations were not altered by consideration of the severity of positive, negative and general symptoms žonly
the antipsychotic dose, cpz, increased with ratings
of positive symptoms žpartial correlation s q0.25,

discussion
this study is unusual for relating serum levels of
medication in patients with schizophrenia to neuropsychological measures of their abilities. it is the
first study of its kind to attempt to relate antipsychotic dose, serum level and da d 2-occupancy in
patients with schizophrenia with multiple measures
of their performance on tests of selective attention
and cognition.
assessment of d 2-receptor antagonism

da d 2-antagonist binding activity circulating in
patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, being sure
about compliance and taking individual pharmaco-

kinetic variability into account. these measures are
important from a clinical point of view, in that to a
degree the da d 2-blocking potential of different
antipsychotic drugs relates to clinical efficacy žhess
et al., 1987., but that there is a threshold above
which the likelihood of extrapyramidal side-effects
increases disproportionately žtauscher et al., 1999..
in the context of subgroup differences, according
to the type of symptoms expressed and the diagnosis,
there were three major findings. first, there were no
differences in serum levels or central d 2-occupancy
between patients expressing high or low degrees of
thought disorder or schneiderian ideas-of-reference,
although patients with much thought disorder tended
to receive higher levels of antipsychotic medication.
secondly, female patients, independent of subgroup
diagnosis, showed higher serum levels of antipsychotic drug and central da d 2-occupancy. thirdly,
the putative central da d 2-occupancy, calculated on
the basis of published pet data, was higher in
patients with a paranoid than those with a nonparanoid diagnosis.
accordingly, one could posit three putative consequences, respectively, that should be tested. first,
the prominence of thought disorder among symptoms encourages the administration of high doses of
antipsychotic drugs. in view of evidence implicating
unusual serotonin function in thought disorder, perhaps antipsychotic drugs with a marked serotonergic
profile would be more appropriate žbender et al.,
1999.. secondly, high serum levels of antipsychotic
drugs with da d 2-binding activity in female versus
male patients may reflect gender-specific pharmacokinetic differences. these differences may arise as
a result of the lower body weight of females and the
lower proportion of female patients who smoke.
žincreased smoking is known to induce enzyme activity in the liver responsible for the metabolism of
antipsychotic drugs, which leads to lower levels of
the antipsychotic drug in the circulation: for a review see batra, 2000.. a further contribution to
increased levels of serum d 2-binding activity in
females could arise from the blocking of da d 2binding by steroid hormones ždi paolo, 1994..
thirdly, increased d 2-receptor occupancy in paranoid patients is a consequence of increased da
activity in this subgroup of patients. this is consistent with our prediction based on post-mortem studies and the increased responsiveness of paranoid
patients to neuroleptic therapy. increased d 2occupancy would be expected, as under current
practice these patients are likely to receive typical
antipsychotic drugs first and to show some clinical
response to them. the pet data show that these

typical antipsychotic drugs exhibit higher degrees of
central da d 2-receptor occupancy than atypical
antipsychotic drugs žtable 2.. direct evidence has
also been provided by studies of the effects of psychostimulant administration žbilder et al., 1992;
laruelle et al., 1999.. laruelle and colleagues demonstrated an increased responsiveness of such
patients to amphetamine challenge, at the level of
the da receptor, da activity and the symptoms
expressed žlaruelle et al., 1999..
relationships between psychological measures and
d 2-receptor antagonism

our second aim in this study was to explore the
possibility of relationships between impaired measures of selective attention and various neuropsychological abilities with measures of da-related activity
reflected by serum levels of antipsychotic drug
d 2-binding activity or putative central da d 2occupancy.
conditioned blocking (cb)

patients who had difficulty in learning the associative learning task did not differ, in the level of
positive, negative or general symptoms expressed,
from those who learned the task successfully žtable
1.. they had higher serum levels of antipsychotic
drug, although they did not show any differences in
central da d 2-occupancy measures, in comparison
with those who learned the task. the occupancy
result probably reflects observations from the pet
studies from which the measures were derived,
namely that saturation of the da d 2 receptor
occurs rapidly, especially following administration of
typical neuroleptics, and thus differences were not
discernible. the increased serum levels may reflect
other unknown pharmacokinetic features that underlie a decreased psychological or clinical response
to antipsychotic medication, but not simply symptom
severity, as noted above.
among those who learned the task, patients with
a non-paranoid diagnosis showed reduced cb. they
learned about all the stimuli presented during the
acquisition and the test phase. this is interpreted as
a persistence of a controlled information-processing
learning strategy normally present at the start of
task-learning. usually stimulus processing and response become automatic with the acquisition of a
learning criterion. high cb scores of paranoid
patients late in the test suggest they were slow to
switch back to a controlled processing mode for
learning about the individual panels. normal or superior performance in paranoid versus impairments
in non-paranoid patients žor similar positivernegabehavioural pharmacology 2000, vol 11 nos 3 & 4

oades et al.

tive symptom groups. have been reported for other
studies of attention-related processing, such as backward masking žwilliams and gordon, 2000 and references therein ..
cb has been reported to be associated positively
with da utilization žoades et al., 1996a, b., on the
basis of urine measures. this is consistent with lower
levels of utilization and metabolite levels in nonparanoid versus paranoid patients, in urinary žoades
et al., 1994. and plasma samples from similar patient
groups with negative and positive symptoms žamin
et al., 1999.. this, in turn, is consistent with the
present finding of higher levels of central da d 2occupancy in the patients with a paranoid diagnosis,
on the assumption that their higher turnover reflected increased da d 2-binding sites, as was predicted in the introduction. that this plays a role in
cb is suggested by the loss of significant differences
in cb performance between the subgroups after
controlling for this factor.
neuropsychology

the neuropsychological test battery was selected
in order to reflect different cognitive functions
attributable to right versus left hemisphere že.g.
visuospatial versus verbal abilities . and frontalr
parietalrtemporal lobe activity že.g. verbal fluency,
mooney faces, story recall.. the most striking association for central da d 2-occupancy was with delayed
recall of a short story ži.e. with logical memories
performance, which reflects largely left temporal
lobe function.. increasing occupancy was related to
improved recall across all subjects, especially for
those showing few ideas-of-reference or little thought
disorder. a negative relationship, a detrimental influence of increased occupancy, was also recorded
for word production, reflecting left frontal lobe
function.
the present demonstration of a putative da d 2receptor-mediated role in memory is not surprising,
in view of the widely reported problems of patients
with schizophrenia on tests of recall že.g. aleman et
al., 1999.. however, it should be emphasized that
our results are clearly at odds with the presumption
that medication had little influence. this, of course,
was based on numerous reports of an absence of a
correlation for performance with cpz equivalents,
that we also describe here. evidence for da
medication-assisted memory performance žverbal recall, left hemisphere., independent of gender, is also
consistent with the findings of a review by spohn
and strauss ž1989.. they attributed improvement on
medication to an increased memory span, and the
328 behavioural pharmacology 2000, vol 11 nos 3 & 4

decreased influence of irrelevant features on task
performance.
our finding that the role of central da d 2occupancy in memory extends to paranoid but not
non-paranoid patients is consistent with three different sets of findings. first, pet measures of da
d 2-occupancy were associated with positive symptoms following olanzapine treatment žlavalaye et
al., 1999.. secondly, impaired recall of verbal passages was associated with increasing plasma levels of
the da metabolite žhomovanillic acid, hva. in a
group of patients mostly diagnosed with paranoid
schizophrenia
žgilbertson et al., 1994.. thirdly, in such patients
high ratings of positive symptoms were associated
with increases of recall and recognition errors žbrebion et al., 1999.. such errors are often false alarms
žbender et al., 1999; brebion et al. 1999., and interpreted in terms of problems with source-monitoring
and response criterion. the present results imply
that these functions are attributable to frontotemporal interactions modulated by da. there is
unequivocal evidence for such a mechanism from
animal studies. mesocortical da input is often on
the same spine of frontal pyramidal neurons receiving hippocampal glutamatergic input. gurden et al.
ž1999. showed that electric stimulation of the ventral
tegmental area žvta., the source of the da input,
enhanced the amplitude and duration of long-term
potentiation žconsidered to be a model for memory
formation. elicited by stimulation of the hippocampal input, and they were able to correlate da levels
with the elicited field potentials.
our hypothesis that antipsychotic dose would yield
correlations with a sign opposite to that for da
d 2-occupancy was confirmed modestly for the
mooney faces closure task and immediate visual
reproduction žfor cpz versus d 2-occupancy., measures of visuospatial functions reflecting right
temporo-parietal function. however, this hypothesis
requires further study, as the relationships between
the other two medication parameters žcpz versus
nu. were not consistent with our prediction. it is
perhaps surprising that we failed to find strong evidence for non-da-mediated impairments resulting
from medication. many neuroleptics have cholinergic and ␣-adrenergic binding properties: antagonism
at both of these sites can impair higher cognitive
and memory functions žspohn and strauss, 1989; li
et al., 1999..
finally, the associations of antipsychotic drug dose
and serum da d 2-blocking activity, negative with
trail-making and picture completion but positive with
block design, could not be specifically predicted. we

dopamine-d2 , neuropsychology and schizophrenia

are not aware of studies directly relating performance on these tests to measures of da-receptor
activity. however, from the discussion of memoryrelated function, above, we would predict that
whereas high levels of da activity might impair
functions required for the block-design test, they
should be helpful in the requirement of set switching

the present report should be regarded as one that
raises working hypotheses for future testing about
putative da d 2-receptor-mediated function in attention and recall. the present data were limited by
the availability of central da d 2-occupancy data for
only five of the more commonly prescribed antipsychotic drugs, and the relatively crude estimations of
occupancy possible for typical antipsychotic drugs:
inclusion of data from more pet studies on a wider
range of antipsychotics would extend the data basis
considerably. the tentative interpretations of the
measures of serum da d 2-blocking activity and
estimations of central da d 2-occupancy, in terms of
hyper- or hypoactivity, will benefit from measures of
the monoamines and metabolites circulating in these
patients.
