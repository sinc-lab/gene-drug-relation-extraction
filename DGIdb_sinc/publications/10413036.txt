summary: the binding of e i cldiprenorphine to /-l, k, and 8
subsites in cortical and subcortical structures was measured by
positron emission tomography in vivo in six patients before and
after surgical relief of trigeminal neuralgia pain. the volume of
distribution of [iicldiprenorphine binding was significantly in­
creased after thermocoagulation of the relevant trigeminal di­
vision in the following areas: prefrontal, insular, perigenual,
mid-cingulate and inferior parietal cortices, basal ganglia, and
thalamus bilaterally. in addition to the pain relief associated

with the surgical procedure, there also was an improvement in
anxiety and depression scores. in the context of other studies,
these changes in binding most likely resulted from the change
in the pain state. the results suggest an increased occupancy by
endogenous opioid peptides during trigeminal pain but can­
not exclude coexistent down-regulation of binding sites.

responses in the inferior parietal cortices. interestingly,

the ongoing neuropathic pain of mononeuropathy stud­
ied in patients before and after acute nerve block was
found to be represented by increased regional cerebral
blood flow (rcbf) in bilateral insula, inferior frontal and
prefrontal cortices, and ipsilateral anterior cingulate cor­

cortex (peyron et ai., 1998). increases and decreases in

of affective and higher cognitive aspects of nociception
such as attention and aversive conditioning. no changes
in rcbf in si or sii have been associated with chronic
pain. these cortical areas are the principal cortical pro­
jections of the "lateral pain system" and are associated
more with aspects of localization and intensity coding
(treed et ai., 1999). notice that both primary occipital
and somatosensory cortices are distinguished from other
cortical areas by their low opioid receptor binding (jones
et ai., 1991c). the common clinical observation that syn­
thetic opiates reduce the unpleasantness of the pain that
still can be localized makes some sense of this physi­
ologic and pharmacologic division between the medial
and lateral pain systems.
one candidate class of compounds that may have a
role in modulating nociceptive responses within some of
the components of the medial pain system are the en­
dogenous opioid peptides. since these were discovered
(hughes, 1975), their precise function in humans has
remained elusive, although there is reasonable evidence
for their involvement in the modulation of nociceptive
processing in animals (hollt et ai., 1985). this is partly
because of difficulties of access and partly because of
difficulties with the use and interpretation of the effects
of opiate antagonists such as naloxone. techniques to
measure availability of brain in vivo opioid receptor
binding in human subjects have been developed using
11
the opioid antagonist [ c] xxxd1913xxx  and pet,
which provide the possibility of measuring changes in
occupancy of opioid receptors by endogenous opioid
peptides (jones et ai., 1994b).
l
the other advantage of e c] xxxd1913xxx  is that it
has been previously shown that there is no correlation
between rcbf and k/k2 or k3!k4 in normal volunteers
(jones et ai., 1994).
previous studies (jones et al., 1994a) have shown sub­
11
stantial changes in cerebral c- xxxd1913xxx  binding in
relation to chronic inflammatory pain states in patients
with rheumatoid arthritis. the latter are consistent with
changes in opioid peptide concentrations in the brain of
arthritic animals (panerai et ai., 1987). we have used
e lc] xxxd1913xxx  and pet (jones et ai., 1987) in six
patients with tn to evaluate whether similar changes in
opioid receptor binding occur during the chronic neuro­
genic pain characteristic of this condition. the hypoth­
l
esis was that reduced e c] xxxd1913xxx  binding would
occur during ongoing pain as a result of increased occu­
pancy by endogenous opioid peptides, and that this
would occur mainly within the components of the medial
pain system.

methods
six male patients (mean age 61. 5 ± 9.5 years; range 46 to 72
years) with tn were studied. each had a typical clinical pre-

j cereb blood flow metab, vol. 19, no. 7, 1999

sentation of tn with a mean length of history of 15 ± 8 years
(range 3 to 26 years). five subjects were right sided and one
was left sided. all patients were affected by pain in the fol­
lowing trigeminal nerve divisions: the maxillary division (three
patients), maxillary and mandibular divisions (two patients), or
just the mandibular division (one patient). routine diagnostic
magnetic resonance (mr) imaging brain scans had been per­
formed. results of these studies were normal in five patients,
whereas an incidental subfrontal meningioma was found in one.
all six patients were taking carbamazepine as their only medi­
cation with a mean dose of 800 ± 300 mg (range 400 to 1300
mg), which was kept constant throughout the duration of the
study, spanning both presurgical and postsurgical scans. three
patients had no previous radiofrequency thermocoagulation
(rftc) treatments, whereas the others had undergone one,
two, or three previous rftc treatments.
two pet studies were performed on each patient: one before
rftc treatment ("in pain"), and one within 3 weeks after
treatment ("pain free"). the rftc treatments were considered
technically successful in all cases, producing analgesia in the
appropriate trigeminal divisions while maintaining light touch
sensibility.
measures of pain, anxiety, and depression were performed
before each scan: namely, the visual analogue score of pain
within the previous 24 hours, and the hospital anxiety and
depression scale of anxiety and depression.
i i c- xxxd1913xxx  pet studies were performed on the cn
953b pet scanner (cn, inc., knoxville, tn, u.s.a.) at the
mrc cyclotron unit. this scanner has retractable interplane
septa and thus the ability to acquire all lines of coincidence
between all planes (spinks et ai., 1992). the inplane resolution
of the scanner in three-dimensional mode is 8.5 x 8.5 x 4.3 mm
(full width-half maximum). after intravenous injection of i i c_
 xxxd1913xxx  (specific activity range 7000 to 3800 mbq/
!-lmol), a dynamic scan over 90 minutes was performed con­
sisting of 17 time frames (6 x 180 seconds, 3 x 240 seconds, 4
x 300 seconds. 4 x 600 seconds). for attenuation correction, a
transmission scan was taken using three external line sources of
germanium-68. to obtain the i i c- xxxd1913xxx  input function,
continuous radioactivity monitoring of the subjects' arterial
blood, with intermittent sampling to measure unchanged i i c_
 xxxd1913xxx  and metabolites, was carried out (jones et ai.,
1987),
the pet images then were reconstructed on a supercard
sc i computer (cspi, billerica, ma, u.s.a.) and pixel-by­
pixel functional images obtained of the [ ilcjdiprenorphine
binding equivalent to total volume of distribution (vdtot) using
a spectral analysis technique (cunningham and jones, 1993;
tadokoro et ai., 1993). the use of vdto! as a measure of spe­
cific binding of rllcjdiprenorphine is discussed in detail by
jones and associates ( l994b). it is directly proportional to the
binding potential and has been shown to be independent of
changes in cbf.
correction of intrasubject head movement during each study
was carried out using the automated image registration pro­
gram (woods et ai., j 992), which normalized each scan to the
first image acquired. results from preoperative and postopera­
tive scans were normalized to the standardized talairach atlas
(talairach and tournoux, 1988; friston et ai., 1991) and su­
perimposed on the standardized mr space. the data from the
preoperative and postoperative studies were pooled into two
normalized preoperative and postoperative images. the single
patient with left-sided pain was mirror-transformed before
group analysis,
statistical differences between the preoperative and postop-

changes in opioid receptor binding
erative groups were analyzed. this included pixel-based analy­
sis of covariance (ancova correction) to eliminate the effect
of random global differences in e ic] xxxd1913xxx  binding
between groups (friston et a!.. 1990). the statistical differences
between the preoperative and postoperative groups were dis­
played as a statistical parametric map (friston and frackowiak,
1991).

results
results from the measures of pain, anxiety, and de­
pression performed before each scan were as follows.
between studies, the pain visual analogue score (which
ranges from 0 [pain free] to 100 [maximal pain possible
pain]) changed from a mean of 45 (range 12 to 73) to 0,
whereas the scores on the hospital anxiety and depres­
sion scale (a score greater than 9 on the depression sub­
scale indicates possible depression, and a score of lion
the anxiety subscale indicates possibly significant anxi­
ety) altered from a mean of 8.5 (anxiety) and 8.5 (de­
pression) to 4 and 3. 5, respectively. statistical analysis
on such small numbers was not considered appropriate.

805

all patients thus were rendered pain free with a reduction
in associated anxiety and depression. all patients expe­
rienced pain on the day of their scan, but none of them
experienced pain during the scanning period.
figure i demonstrates the statistical parametric map of
the focal areas of significantly increased  xxxd1913xxx 
binding (p < 0. 01, t test) when patients were free of pain
compared with when they were in pain, averaged across
the whole group of six patients and normalized to the
standardized talairach atlas (talairach and tournoux,
1988; friston et ai., 1991) and mr space. the distribu­
tion of opioid receptor binding within different cortical
areas was consistent with previously published normal
data, and therefore only the changes in opioid receptor
binding between the two states are mentioned here. all
of the significant changes in binding are in areas with
high concentrations of opioid receptor binding. signifi­
cant bilateral increases in binding were observed primar­
ily in the dorsolateral prefrontal (areas 44 and 8: best
seen in the middle row, images i through 3), medial

tably not in the primary somatosensory cortex) are not
commented on further. further analyses were performed
excluding in turn the one patient with left-sided tn and
the one patient with a subfrontal meningioma. the areas
of increased binding found as a result of this subanalysis
were not found to be significantly different.

tion to the stress of the operation or altered stress asso­
ciated with the actual scan, since previous studies in
normal volunteers and patients suggest reproducible
binding parameters for both pulse-chase and tracer-alone
protocols (jones et ai., 1994b). stress in animals has been
shown to produce reductions in mainly subcortical in
vivo e h] xxxd1913xxx  binding (seeger et ai., 1984)
rather than increases. although it is possible that relative
changes in rcbf may have a small effect on the vdlol of
e lc] xxxd1913xxx  binding, this is unlikely to be sub­
stantial. it has been previously demonstrated that there is
no correlation between rcbf and k/k2 or k3/k4 in nor­
mal volunteers (jones et ai., 1987), and it is therefore
unlikely that the situation would be different in this

discussion
focal brain increases in  xxxd1913xxx  binding when
pain free are most likely to be caused by a decreased
occupation of opioid receptors (fl, 8, and k) by endog­
enous opioid peptides, resulting in increased available
sites for [iicldiprenorphine binding, up-regulation of to­
tal binding sites, or both. this technique cannot distin­
guish between these possibilities. two high and low spe­
cific activity scans in each state might go some way to
achieve this (sadzot et ai., 1991) but would have been
unlikely to be acceptable to the patients. this entire pro­
cedure requires' that patients lie still in the scanner for a
minimum of 2 hours. changes in affinity state as an
explanation for these results are less likely, since these
have not been observed in the brain during experimental
pain (yonehara et ai., 1983). the posttreatment scans
were performed within 3 weeks of being rendered pain
free and a mean of ii days after the operation. it is
unlikely that this response represents a nonspecific reactable 1. selection of areas with bilateral increases in

group of patients.
anxiety, depression, and pain scores all improved af­
ter rftc treatments with complete resolution of the
pain. it is unlikely that the changes in [iicldiprenorphine
binding are purely a result of the change in mood state,
since the current evidence suggests that an increase
rather than a decrease in binding should occur during
depression. substantial up-regulation of frontal and an­
terior cingulate opiate receptor binding, which may be
compensatory for reduced opioid peptide release, has
been well documented in suicide victims (gross-isseroff
et ai., 1990). preliminary pet results have confirmed a
similar finding in patients with depression (mayberg et
ai., 1991). if this were a significant factor in our studies,
this would produce the opposite effect of that observed.
it is therefore likely that the major psychological com­
ponent resulting in the change in [iicldiprenorphine
binding is the change in the pain state. as far as we are
aware, this is the first direct evidence for activation of the
endogenous opioid system during neuropathic pain. most
of the areas where significant changes in binding oc­
curred also have been demonstrated to be implicated in
acute (jones et ai., 1991a; talbot et ai., 1991; jones et
ai., 1992; casey et ai., 1994) and tonic experimental pain
processing (derbyshire and jones, 1998; di pierro et ai.,
1994). most of these structures apart from dorsolateral
prefrontal cortex also have been shown to be involved in
the processing of chronic neuropathic pain (hsieh et ai.,
1995; cesaro et ai., 1991).
although opiate receptors are widespread and have
several different functions in the brain, previous in vivo
pet studies using  xxxd1913xxx  suggest that there are
more discrete areas such as prefrontal cortex and anterior
cingulate where endogenous opiates may have a discrete
function in relation to chronic inflammatory pain (jones
et ai., 1994a). also notice that the synthetic mu-agonist
fentanyl in analgesic doses also causes significant in­
creases in rcbf in bilateral prefrontal, anterior cingulate,
and caudate nuclei (firestone et ai., 1996). preliminary
data suggest that morphine-induced analgesia for cancer
pain is associated with increased rcbf in frontal, ante-

changes in opioid receptor binding

807

rior cingulate, and insula cortices (jones et ai., 1991b).
from our own preliminary results, it appears that the
main endogenous opiate responses are within the sub­
cortical and cortical projections of the so-called medial

bral half-life. the new generation of  xxxg1417xxx  in­
hibitors have been used to elicit the opposite behavioral
effects to anti-l3-endorphin antibody (chipkin et ai.,
1988; ruiz-gayo et ai., 1992). the substantially in­

pain system. so far, no changes in opioid receptor bind­
ing have been observed in the cortical projections of the
lateral pain system to the primary or secondary somato­
sensory cortices during either inflammatory or neuro­
pathic pain, the former having relatively low levels of
opioid receptor binding (jones et ai., 1991c). notice that
the main differences in patterns of cortical activation in

potential for human use. the exciting challenge for the
future is to establish whether the substantial changes in
the endogenous opioid system during trigeminal neural­
gic and other types of pain might be amenable to con­
trolled pharmacologic manipulation to further increase
opioid receptor occupancy within the medial pain sys­
tem. the spare opioid binding capacity makes this sys­
tem amenable to such an approach. positron emission

occupancy and their physiologic effects in humans.

tional, and intensity coding components of nociceptive
processing, whereas the somatosensory cortex is more
robustly activated when there is a prominent localization
element to the stimulus (jones, 1998). this has been
demonstrated by manipulating the affective components
of a nociceptive stimulus while maintaining the intensity
rating constant (rainville et ai., 1997) using hypnosis
and pet. using a hypothesis-driven region of interest
approach to the analysis, rcbf changes in the anterior
cingulate cortex, were clearly correlated with changes in
affective response with an absence of correlation in si. it
is therefore not surprising that the main changes in the
endogenous opioid system should be found within the
projections of the medial pain system.
although early pain activation studies emphasize the
lateralization of cerebral pain responses (casey et ai.,

1994; talbot et ai., 1991), subsequent studies with a
more sensitive scanner in three-dimensional mode of ac­
quisition provide evidence for bilateral activation of an­
terior cingulate, insula, and prefrontal cortices and thala­
mus (vogt et ai., 1996).
after surgical pain relief of trigeminal neuralgic pain,
there are significant increases in [iic] xxxd1913xxx 
binding within some of the cortical and subcortical com­
ponents of the pain matrix, consistent with the concept of
decreased occupancy by endogenous opioid peptides
when pain free. it is not within the scope of this experi­
ment to determine the physiologic consequences of the
11
changes in [ c] xxxd1913xxx  binding. however, in ani­
mals with experimentally induced acute prolonged pain,
increased pain behavior has been demonstrated after in­
tracerebroventricular anti-l3-endorphin antibody (porro
et ai., 1999). interestingly, this was accompanied by in­
creased metabolic activity in several structures including
the thalamus, caudate nucleus, parietal, cingulate, and
frontal and insula cortices. this experiment neatly
avoided some of the inherent problems associated with
naloxone, including peripheral and central agonist and
antagonist effects at different doses and the short cere-
