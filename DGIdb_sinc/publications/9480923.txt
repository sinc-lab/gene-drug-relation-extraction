ceramide is an important regulatory molecule implicated in a
variety of biological processes in response to stress and cytokines.
to understand the signal transduction pathway of ceramide to the
nucleus, in the present study, we examined whether c2-ceramide,
a cell permeable ceramide, activates c-fos serum response element
(sre). treatment of rat-2 fibroblast cells with c2-ceramide
caused the stimulation of c-fos sre-dependent reporter gene
activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner by transient
transfection analysis. next, we examined the role of rho family
gtpases in the ceramide-induced signalling to sre activation.
by reporter gene analysis following transient transfections with
various plasmids expressing a dominant negative mutant form of
cdc42, rac1 or rhoa, c2-ceramide-induced sre activation
was shown to be selectively repressed by pexv-racn17 encoding
a dominant negative mutant of rac1, suggesting that rac activity

is essential for the signalling cascade of ceramide to the nucleus.
in a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of rac in
the ceramide-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with  xxxd3060xxx , a potent and specific inhibitor
of phospholipase a , or co-transfection with antisense cytosolic
#
phospholipase a (cpla ) oligonucleotide repressed the c2#
#
ceramide-induced sre activation selectively, implying a critical
role of cpla in c2-ceramide-induced signalling to nucleus.
#
consistent with these results, the translocation of cpla protein
#
as well as the release of  xxxd208xxx , a principal product of
phospholipase a , was rapidly induced by the addition of c2#
ceramide in a rac-dependent manner. together, our findings
suggest the critical role of ‘ rac and subsequent activation of
phospholipase a ’ in ceramide-signalling to nucleus.

introduction

transfection analysis. our results clearly demonstrate that exogenous c2-ceramide stimulates sre in a dose- and timedependent manner in rat-2 fibroblast cells. in our further study
to understand the downstream signalling cascade of ceramide,
we demonstrated that rac, a member of rho family gtpases
[10], and subsequent phospholipase a (pla ) activation [11] are
#
#
essential for the ceramide-induced signalling pathway to c-fos
sre. thus, we propose that ‘ rac and rac-activated pla
#
cascade ’ is one of the major nuclear signalling pathways by
which ceramide stimulates c-fos sre.

ceramide, a product of sphingomyelin (sm) hydrolysis by
sphingomyelinase (smase) and a proposed lipid second messenger, has been shown to mediate many cellular processes
including cell growth, differentiation or apoptosis [1–5]. despite
these suggested actions being implicated in a variety of biological
processes, the signalling mechanism of ceramide in the cell
remains unclear. recent report suggests that ceramide activates
the c-jun amino-terminal kinase (jnk) cascade, composed of
mekk (mitogen activated kinase kinase-1), jnkk (jnk kinase)
and jnk ( xxxg1370xxx ), which is also termed the
stress-activated protein kinase ( xxxg1372xxx ) pathway [6]. for example,
in response to  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-alpha,  xxxd3135xxx ,
ultraviolet (uv) radiation, or x-rays, ceramide is generated by
sm hydrolysis in the cell membrane and stimulates the jnk
cascade [6]. thus, jnk-linked signalling pathway could be one
of the major signalling cascades by which ceramide mediates the
stress or proinflammatory cytokine signals in the cell.
it has been shown that the jnk cascade activates tcf
(ternary complex factor) protein, elk-1}p62tcf [7–9]. for example, in response to interleukin-1 (il-1) or uv radiation, jnk
signalling cascade is stimulated, thereby activating elk-1}p62tcf
to activate c-fos sre (serum response element) [7–9]. thus, the
signalling connection between ceramide and c-fos sre activation
via jnk-elk-1}p62tcf cascade may potentially exist to mediate
the intracellular action of environmental stress or cytokines. to
investigate the possible activity of ceramide to stimulate sre, in
this present study, we analysed the effect of c2-ceramide, a cell
permeable ceramide, on the activation of c-fos sre by transient

cell culture, transfections and luciferase assay

sds/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blotting

rat-2 fibroblast cells were obtained from the american type
culture collection (atcc, crl 1764). cells were grown in
dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium (dmem) supplemented
with 2 mm glutamine, 10 % (v}v) fetal bovine serum (fbs) and
 xxxd2193xxx  as described before [12]. transient transfection
analysis was performed as described previously [13]. to control
for variations in both cell numbers and transfection efficiency, all
clones were co-transfected with 1 µg of pcmv-betagal, an
eucaryotic expression vector in which e. coli beta-galactosidase (lac
z) structural gene is under the transcriptional control of the
cmv promoter [13]. lysates prepared from the harvested cells
were assayed for both luciferase activity and beta-galactosidase
activity, which was used as an internal standard to normalize the
luciferase activity directed by the test plasmid [13]. luciferase
activity was determined as described previously [13]. transfection
experiments were performed in triplicate with two independently
isolated sets and the results were averaged. rat-2 clones stably
expressing racn17 were prepared by co-transfecting pexvracn17 plasmid with psv-neo2 plasmid followed by the
selection of clones in the presence of  xxxg418xxx  antibiotic (400 µg}ml)
for 2–3 weeks as described previously [14]. expression of racn17
protein in the clones was confirmed by western blot hybridization
using anti-myc epitope antibody.

 xxxd3215xxx  (sds)}polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 8 % acrylamide gels, and proteins
were transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes for
2 h at 100 v using a novex wet transfer unit. the membrane
were blocked overnight with tbs [pbs containing 0±01 % (v}v)
tween 20] with 5 % (w}v) nonfat dried milk. blots were incubated
for 2 h with primary antibody (to cpla ) in tbs and then for 1 h
#
with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody,
prior to development using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit
(amersham corp.). bands corresponding to cpla were
#
measured by densitometry and the purified recombinant proteins
were used as standards to calibrate the densitometer.

as a first step towards understanding the signalling pathway of
ceramide toward gene regulation, we have examined whether
c2-ceramide, a cell permeable ceramide, activates c-fos serum

supplemented to each well and incubated for 24 h, then washed
at least four times with dmem containing 0±5 % fbs. then,

[$h]aa into the medium was quantitated by scintillation counting of 0±5 ml medium each time. at the end of experiments, the
cells were solubilized with 0±5 ml of  xxxd102xxx  (etoh) for the
determination of total intracellular incorporation. counts were
corrected for total incorporation.

subcellular fractionation of cell lysates
rat-2 cells were serum-starved for 18 h in serum-free dmem
and appropriate agonists were treated for the indicated times.
the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with
ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (pbs), scraped, harvested by
micro-centrifugation, and resuspended in 0±2 ml of buffer a

needle on ice. lysates were ultra-centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx  000 g for 1 h
to prepare cytosolic and total particulate fractions. the particulate fractions containing membrane fraction were washed
twice and resuspended in 50 µl of buffer b (buffer a plus 1 %

5 volume of acetone, incubated on ice for 5 min, centrifuged
(14 000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 °c), and the pellet was resuspended
in 50 µl of buffer a. protein concentrations were determined
using the bradford procedure with bio-rad dye reagent and
bovine  xxxg124xxx  as a standard.

minimal promoter fused to luciferase coding sequences (figure
1a) [16]. following transient transfections with psre-luc (3 µg)
plasmid, rat-2 cells were serum-starved in dmem containing
0±5 % fbs for 36 h before treating c2-ceramide. sre activation
was monitored by measuring luciferase activities normalized
with co-transfected beta-galactosidase activity. as shown in figure
1c, c2-ceramide stimulated c-fos sre-dependent reporter gene
activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. a five-fold
increase in the luciferase activity occurred at 1 h after the addition
of exogenous c2-ceramide (10 µm) and then the c-fos sre
luciferase level declined (figure 1c). maximal luciferase activity
was detected  xxxd1891xxx  µm concentration of c2-ceramide (figure
1c).
in a control experiment to demonstrate the specific action of
c2-ceramide toward sre, rat-2 cells were transiently transfected
with po-luc (vector without sre) and very little stimulation of
luciferase activity was observed in response to c2-ceramide
addition. we observed a dramatic stimulation (e 40-fold) of the
relative luciferase activity of psre-luc compared to po-luc,
suggesting that the c2-ceramide signal to sre activation is quite
specific (figure 1b). together, these results indicate that c-fos
sre is one of the nuclear target sequences by c2-ceramide in
rat-2 fibroblast cells.

c2-ceramide activates c-fos sre mostly by elk-1/p62tcfindependent signalling pathway
as ceramide has been reported to stimulate jnk cascade which
had been shown to induce the activation of elk-1}p62tcf, one of
the tcfs (ternary complex factors) [7–9], we examined whether
elk-1}p62tcf-dependent signalling pathway is required for the
c2-ceramide-induced sre activation. to do this, a mutant sreluciferase plasmid defective in elk-1}p62tcf binding (psremtluc) was transiently transfected, treated with c2-ceramide, and
the resulting luciferase activity was compared to that obtained
using psrewt-luc, a wild type sre-luciferase. as shown in
table 1, the oligonucleotide in psremt-luc plasmid contains
two point mutations (aga to tgt ) which abolish elk-1}p62tcf
binding [16]. c2-ceramide (10 µm) activated both srewtluciferase (e 4±6-fold) and sremt-luciferase (e 4±3-fold) about
equally as shown in table 1. in a control test, pma (phorbol-12-

 xxxd2681xxx -13-acetate ; 10 ng}ml) activated sremt-luciferase activity much less compared to wild type sre (e 38 % activation
of srewt-luciferase activity). in contrast, lpa (lysophosphatidic
acid ; 10 µm), which had been previously shown to activate sre
by elk-1}p62tcf-independent pathway [17], stimulated both
sre mutant- and sre wild type-dependent luciferase activity to
the same level. together, these results suggest that elk-1}p62tcfdependent pathway is not the major signalling route of c2ceramide to c-fos sre although c2-ceramide appears to require
elk-1}p62tcf-dependent pathway for the full activation of sre.
thus, c2-ceramide stimulates mostly elk-1}p62tcf-independent
signalling cascade to activate sre in rat-2 fibroblasts.

rac activity is essential for the c2-ceramide-induced c-fos sre
activation
recently, several rho family gtpases including rac and cdc42
have been reported to be involved in the signalling cascade
induced by cytokines and environmental stress [18,19]. to
investigate any potential role of rho family gtpases in ceramidesignalling cascade to nucleus, psre-luc (3 µg) was transiently
co-transfected with various amounts (0, 1, 2±5, 5 µg) of pexv

mutant of rac1), or pexv-rhon19 (encoding a dominant
negative mutant of rhoa). as shown in table 2, c2-ceramideinduced sre activation is dramatically inhibited by co-transfection with pexv-racn17 (e 68 % reduction of luciferase
activity by 5 µg transfection), suggesting that rac is critical for
the c2-ceramide-induced signalling to c-fos sre. in contrast, no
detectable inhibition was observed by co-transfection with either
pexv-cdc42n17 or pexv-rhon19 (table 2). on the other
hand, lpa (lysophosphatidic acid ; 10 µm)-induced sre activation was significantly inhibited only by rhon19, not by
cdc42n17 or racn17, indicating that lpa-signalling to c-fos
sre is primarily through rhoa-linked pathway [17]. together,
these results indicate an essential role of rac in c2-ceramideinduced signalling to c-fos sre. to analyse further the role of
rho, we have tested the effect of botulinum c3 transferase
expression which has been shown to specifically inhibit rho via
adp-ribosylation at asn-41 [17]. cells were co-transfected with
ef (vector) or ef-c3 (c3 transferase) together with sreluciferase reporter gene to see whether c3 transferase cotransfection blocks c2-ceramide-induced sre activation. as
shown in table 2, we observed that ef-c3 blocked dramatically
lpa (10 µm)-induced sre activation (e 80 % reduction of
luciferase activity by 1 µg of ef-c3), whereas c2-ceramide
(10 µm)-induced sre activation was not affected (table 2b).
this result again suggests that c2-ceramide-signalling to c-fos
sre is not dependent upon rhoa.

role of pla2 in the c2-ceramide-induced signalling to sre
activation
recently,  xxxd208xxx  (aa) has been shown to be released
via phospholipase a (pla ) in response to rac activation,
#
#
implying a potential role of ‘ rac-activated pla in rac-mediated
#
signalling pathway ’ [11,12,20,21]. in our further study to understand the downstream mediator of rac gtpase in ceramidesignalling cascade, we examined whether rac-activated pla is
#
involved in the c2-ceramide-induced sre activation. to do this,
we first tested whether  xxxd3060xxx , a potent and specific inhibitor
of pla , could inhibit the c2-ceramide-induced sre activation.
#
as shown in table 3,  xxxd3060xxx  (1 µm) treatment inhibited the
c2-ceramide-induced sre activation by approx. 60 % without
affecting lpa-induced sre activation. similarly, we observed

the picture. (b) data are expressed as a relative percentage of the basal value (0 min ; 100 %)

(cpla ) oligonucleotide, not control cpla oligonucleotide,
#
#
could significantly inhibit c2-ceramide-induced sre activation
(e 60 % inhibition by co-transfection with 0±1 µm of antisense
cpla oligomer) with no effects on lpa-induced sre activation,
#
suggesting that cpla is clearly involved in the c2-ceramide#
induced signalling to c-fos sre (table 3).
to examine further the role of cpla in the c2-ceramide
#
signalling pathway, we determined whether c2-ceramide stimulates the translocation of cpla to membrane. to do this,
#
serum-starved rat-2 cells were stimulated with 10 µm of c2ceramide for the indicated times (0, 1, 2, 5 min). then, the cells
were lysed, and the particulate membrane fractions were analysed
for cpla by western blotting. as shown in figure 2, cpla
#
#
( xxxd1769xxx  kda) was translocated to the membrane in a timedependent manner. by 5 min treatment of c2-ceramide (as shown
in lane 4), approx. 4±5-fold increase in translocation was observed,
demonstrating the apparent stimulation of cpla by ceramide.
#
we observed an equivalent loss of cpla levels from the cytosolic
#
fraction with time (data not shown). this result again points to
a critical role of cpla in the ceramide-signalling in the cell. in

addition, we determined whether aa, a principal product of

times with dmem containing 0±5 % fbs as described in ‘ materials and methods ’. control buffer
(—), egf (50 ng/ml), lpa (10 µm), or c2-ceramide (10 µm) was added 1 h before the
harvest for the determination of [3h]aa release. for the inhibitor test,  xxxd3060xxx  (1 µm) was
pretreated 30 min before the addition of c2-ceramide or lpa. the released [3h]aa into the
medium was quantitated by scintillation counting and normalized by the total counts as
described in ‘ materials and methods ’. the results are means ³s.d. obtained with triple
samples (n.d., not determined).

‘ materials and methods ’. as shown in table 4, c2-ceramide
induced a significant liberation of aa (e 4±2-fold stimulation of
aa release over control), but this over-induced liberation of aa
was significantly diminished by 30 min pretreatment with  xxxd3060xxx  (1 µm), suggesting that pla plays a major role in
#
mediating c2-ceramide-induced aa release. next, we determined
whether this aa liberation requires rac activity or not. by
comparing the level of aa liberation between control cells and
cells stably expressing racn17 (rat2-racn17), it was shown
that in rat2-racn17 cells the release of aa was reduced
significantly (e 38 % level compared to that in rat-2 cells) in
response to c2-ceramide, suggesting that c2-ceramide induces
aa liberation via rac-dependent manner (table 4). in contrast,
lpa-induced aa release was not inhibited in rat2-racn17
cells. together, these results point to a critical role of racactivated pla in the c2-ceramide-induced signalling cascade.

discussion
the present study demonstrated that rac activity is essential for
the signalling pathway of c2-ceramide to c-fos sre. by reporter
gene analysis following transient transfections with pexvracn17 encoding a dominant negative rac mutant, racn17,
c2-ceramide-induced sre activation was shown to be selectively
repressed, revealing that rac activity is critical for the signalling
cascade of ceramide to nucleus. although rac appears to be
essential for c2-ceramide signalling pathway to sre activation,
the downstream kinase cascade that mediates this effect is yet to
be identified. recently, rac has been shown to function in the
regulation of kinase cascades. for example, cdc42 and rac
regulate paks (p21-activated kinases), a family of highly related
serine} xxxd3361xxx  kinases, jnk, and also p38}hog kinase, map
kinase homologues [18,19,22,23]. another kinase, 70 kda ribosomal s6 kinase (pp70s'k), is recently reported to be activated by
cdc42 and rac1 in response to growth factors such as egf and
platelet-derived growth factor [24]. in response to proinflammatory cytokines and environmental stress, rac has been
reported to activate jnk signalling cascade [18,19]. as jnk
pathway was shown to stimulate elk-1}p62tcf to activate sre,
the signalling cascade of rac-jnk-elk-1}p62tcf may potentially
exist. however, our result (table 1) suggests that jnk-linked
cascade is unlikely to be the major signalling pathway by which
c2-ceramide mediates c-fos sre activation, as c2-ceramide still
activates c-fos sre mutant defective in elk-1}p62tcf binding.
thus, rac may also mediate elk-1}p62tcf-independent signalling

pathway to sre activation, depending on the type of agonists or
stress. consistent with this idea, hill et al. demonstrated that
rho family gtpases including rac activate c-fos sre through
elk-1}p62tcf-independent pathway [17].
our results demonstrate that ‘ rac-activated pla ’ is clearly
#
involved in the ceramide-signalling cascade to c-fos sre, suggesting that pla may be one of the target molecules of rac in the
#
ceramide-induced nuclear signalling pathway. besides activating
pla activity, c2-ceramide was also shown to stimulate the
#
transcription of cytosolic pla mrna [25]. thus, it is plausible
#
that one of the key roles of ceramide is to amplify the magnitude
of signals generated through the pla pathway. consistent with
#
the role of pla as one of the downstream target molecules of
#
ceramide signal, pla was shown to participate in the cell death
#
programme in several cell types [26–28]. also, there is an
increasing amount of evidence suggesting signalling-link between
the sphingomyelin cycle and pla -mediated  xxxd208xxx 
#
metabolism [25,29–31].
in summary, in the present study, we have shown that c2ceramide activates c-fos sre via rac-dependent signalling pathway in rat-2 fibroblast cells. although the exact mechanism of
rac action in c2-ceramide-signalling remains unclear yet, we
suspect that the role of rac in the c2-ceramide-induced sre
activation is, at least partly, exerted through the activation of
phospholipase a , especially cytosolic pla .
