abstract
low levels of serotonin may reduce the density of the serotonin transporter (sert) by either increasing trafficking or reducing synthesis;
a ‘‘neuroadaptive response’’. to determine whether  xxxd2611xxx  (mdma)-induced reductions in sert density
could be related to such a mechanism, p-chlorophenylalanine or mdma was administered to rats, and brain serotonin and sert density were
measured. as expected, both treatments led to serotonin depletion 1, 7 and 14 days later. however, only mdma reduced sert density. this
observation suggests that mdma-induced reductions in sert density do not represent neuroadaptive responses to decreased levels of brain
serotonin, but may occur in response to some other stimulus or to the neurotoxic effects of mdma.

1. introduction
administration of  xxxd2611xxx 
(mdma) leads to lasting reductions in the levels of regional
brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht), its metabolite
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa), and the density of the
serotonin transporter (sert) (battaglia et al., 1987; colado
et al., 1993, 1995; fischer et al., 1995; scanzello et al.,
1993; schmidt, 1987). these reductions are assumed to
reflect a toxic loss of serotonin terminal fibres, this assumption being supported by data demonstrating that decreases in
5-ht axonal markers are associated with reductions in the
density of immunostained serotonergic axons and axon
terminals (o’hearn et al., 1988; scanzello et al., 1993).
furthermore, use of positron emission tomography (pet)
has enabled detection of regional decreases in sert density
following mdma administration to nonhuman primates
(scheffel et al., 1998) and in human recreational users
(mccann et al., 1998).

however, recent in vitro evidence suggests that serts
are trafficked between the cell membrane and the intracellular compartment (qian et al., 1997; ramamoorthy and
blakely, 1999), whereby protein kinase c and the catalytic
subunit of protein phosphatase 2a ( xxxg1817xxx ) act to phosphorylate and sequester the sert (bauman et al., 2000).
acutely, the presence of 5-ht has been demonstrated to
prevent the phosphorylation and sequestration of sert
(ramamoorthy and blakely, 1999) while, in the medium
to long term, homeostatic mechanisms may also act to
reduce the synthesis of the sert protein, if brain 5-ht
concentrations are consistently low (linnet et al., 1995;
rattray et al., 1996; yu et al., 1995).
both sequestration and reduced protein synthesis have
been suggested to represent a homeostatic loop in which
the number and density of serts on the cell membrane
are linked to synaptic 5-ht concentrations (ramamoorthy
and blakely, 1999). thus, low levels of 5-ht may be
expected to lead to increased sequestration of the sert
and reduced synthesis of the sert protein. in this vein,
the reduction in the density of the sert binding seen after
mdma administration may represent a ‘‘neuroadaptive
response’’ to low levels of 5-ht in the synaptic cleft (or
a ‘‘functional downregulation’’). to evaluate this possibility, we induced 5-ht depletion with either the tryptophan
hydroxylase inhibitor, p-chlorophenylalanine, or mdma

then measured sert density using [3h]paroxetine binding.
assessments of brain 5-ht and sert density were made
1, 7 and 14 days following drug treatment. this allowed us
to determine to what extent reductions in the sert seen
after mdma represents ‘‘neuroadaptation’’ to low levels
of 5-ht, or loss of the sert secondary to some other
cause.

were sacrificed in parallel with the mdma- and p-chlorophenylalanine-treated animals, respectively. the experiment
was designed such that day 1 for each group corresponded
to the time-point at which a significant reduction in 5-ht
could be expected (dewar et al., 1992; schmidt, 1987;
colado et al., 1993), which would persist in animals
sacrificed at the later time-points.

2. methods

2.3. determination of brain 5-ht and 5-hiaa concentrations

2.1. animals
adult male sprague – dawley rats (175 – 225 g; harlan,
indianapolis, in, usa) were housed individually in an
ambient temperature of 22 f 1 jc and a 12-h light/dark
cycle (lights on: 0600 h). food and water were freely
provided. all animal care and experimental manipulations
were approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee at the johns hopkins university school of
medicine, and were in accordance with the national institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals.
2.2. drugs and drug administration
drugs and chemicals were obtained from the following
sources: ( f )- xxxd2611xxx  hcl
(mdma) and (-)-cocaine hcl (national institute of drug
abuse, baltimore, md, usa), p-chlorophenylalanine methyl
ester hcl, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-hiaa) (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo,
usa), sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate,  xxxd1710xxx ,
sodium octyl sulphate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
(edta), phosphoric acid, tris –hydrochloride (tris –hcl),
 xxxd3449xxx ,  xxxd3213xxx  (nacl),  xxxd2988xxx  (kcl)
and sodium iodide (j.t. baker, phillipsburg, nj, usa),
citalopram (h. lundbeck, copenhagen, denmark), [3h]
paroxetine and [125i]3h-(4-iodophenyl)tropan-2h-carboxylic
acid methyl ester ([125i]rti-55) (new england nuclear,
boston, ma, usa). mdma and p-chlorophenylalanine
were dissolved in normal saline (nacl; 0.9% w/v) at a volume
of 1 ml/kg, and doses are quoted as the salt weight.
animals were randomly assigned to four treatment
groups (n = 15-18 in each group). group (1): p-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg/kg i.p.) was administered daily for 2
days, the following day being designated day 1, followed
by a further four doses (100 mg/kg i.p.) on alternate days
(days 2, 4, 6 and 8). animals were sacrificed on either day
1, 7 or 14, thus being subjected to acute (two doses) or
subchronic (five or six doses) p-chlorophenylalanine treatment (dewar et al., 1992). group (2): mdma (20 mg/kg
s.c.) was administered twice daily for 4 consecutive days,
the following day being designated day 1. animals were
sacrificed on either day 1, 7 or 14. groups (3) and (4):
vehicle (nacl; 0.9% w/v) was administered and animals

cortical and hippocampal concentrations of 5-ht and 5hiaa were determined via high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, as previously
described (scanzello et al., 1993). briefly, on days 1, 7 and
14 (see section 2.2), rats from each treatment group were
sacrificed via decapitation, their brains rapidly removed and
dissected out on ice. tissue was immediately wrapped in
aluminium foil and stored in liquid nitrogen prior to assay.
frozen tissue samples were weighed, placed in 1.0 ml of 0.4
n perchloric acid, homogenized (15 s), then centrifuged
(15,000 r.p.m., 20 min, 4 jc), the supernatants decanted
and stored in liquid nitrogen as 250 al aliquots until assay.
the mobile phase consisted of sodium phosphate (125
mm),  xxxd1710xxx  (125 mm), sodium octyl sulphate (0.12
mm) and edta (0.27 mm), was adjusted to ph 3 with
phosphoric acid, filtered and degassed. a stainless steel
reversed phase column (5 am, 250  4.6 mm) was used and
the electrochemical current produced was monitored via an
integrator.
2.4. [3h]paroxetine binding in tissue homogenates
[3h]paroxetine binding was also determined in cortical
and hippocampal tissue as previously described (scanzello
et al., 1993). briefly, homogenates were prepared from
tissue obtained on days 1, 7 and 14. frozen tissue was
weighed and placed in 1 ml ice-cold  xxxd3449xxx  (40 mm
tris – hcl, 8 mm  xxxd3449xxx , 120 mm nacl and 5 mm kcl;
ph 7.4). samples were homogenized (30 s) then centrifuged
(20,000 r.p.m., 10 min, 4 jc), the supernatants were
discarded and the resulting pellets resuspended in 2 ml
ice-cold  xxxd3449xxx . the tissue pellets were homogenized
(15 s), centrifuged and resuspended as before. following the
final homogenization step (5 s),  xxxd3449xxx  was added to
give a final concentration of 12 mg tissue/ml. the assay
solution (2.5 ml) contained a saturating concentration of
[3h]paroxetine (2.4 nm) and 250 al tissue homogenate, with
the addition of citalopram (10 am) for determination of
nonspecific binding. assays were performed in triplicate.
samples were incubated (60 min, room temperature) prior to
rapid filtration using 3  5 ml cold  xxxd3449xxx . the filters
were transferred to plastic vials containing 5 ml scintillation
cocktail (liquiscint, national diagnostics, atlanta, ga,
usa) and radioactivity was counted by scintillation spectrometry.

2.5. autoradiography –[125i]rti-55 binding
sert binding was also determined via autoradiography,
according to the general method of boja et al. (1992).
briefly, frozen tissue was coronally sectioned (20 am) and
thaw-mounted, air-dried and stored at 70 jc until further
processing. sections were equilibrated to room temperature,
and then incubated for 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline
(137 mm nacl, 2.7 mm kcl, 10.14 mm sodium phosphate,
1.76 mm potassium phosphate, 10 mm sodium iodide; ph
7.4). the tissue sections were subsequently incubated for 60
min in [125i]rti-55 (50 pm); nonspecific binding was

241

determined using (-)-cocaine hcl (50 am). the tissue
sections were then washed twice (20 min each) in ice-cold
buffer and, finally, rinsed in ice-cold double distilled water
(1 min). sections were dried in a refrigerator (30 min), then
exposed to film (kodak bio max) for 24 h.
2.6. statistics
statistical analysis was performed using graphpad prism
(san diego, ca, usa). initial comparisons between control
groups were performed using unpaired t-tests, which
revealed no significant differences. thus, the two control

kg i.p., daily for 2 days, followed by 100 mg/kg i.p. on alternate days for a further four occasions) and sacrificed on days 1, 7 or 14 (day 1 being designated as

groups were pooled for subsequent analyses. comparisons
between p-chlorophenylalanine- and mdma-treated and
control groups were performed using one-way analyses of
variance (anova) followed by tukey multiple comparison
tests in instances when a significant f value was obtained.
the relationship between [3h]paroxetine binding and 5-ht
levels was assessed using spearman’s rank correlation
within both p-chlorophenylalanine- and mdma-treated
groups. results are stated as mean f s.e.m.

animals on all days, with the exception of the hippocampus
on day 14; cortex day 1: p < 0.01, days 7 and 14: p < 0.05,
hippocampus day 1: p < 0.05, day 7: p < 0.01. no such
correlation was observed in either control or p-chlorophenylalanine-treated groups.
3.3. effect of p-chlorophenylalanine and mdma on
[125i]rti-55 binding
autoradiographic studies with [125i]rti-55 revealed
intense radioligand binding to the sert in all brain areas
visualised in both control and p-chlorophenylalanine-treated
animals. in contrast, mdma-treated animals demonstrated
marked reductions in sert density in the hippocampus and
cortex (fig. 2).

administration of p-chlorophenylalanine resulted in significant reductions in cortical and hippocampal (fig. 1a, c
and e) concentrations of 5-ht and 5-hiaa compared to
both control and mdma-treated animals on all 3 days
investigated. mdma also significantly reduced cortical
and hippocampal (fig. 1a, c and e) 5-ht and 5-hiaa
levels compared to controls, although to a lesser extent than
p-chlorophenylalanine-treated rats.
in addition, p-chlorophenylalanine-induced loss of 5-ht
in the hippocampus differed between days; a significantly
greater reduction in 5-ht was observed on days 1 and 7
compared to day 14 ( p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively).
there were no significant differences in cortical or hippocampal 5-hiaa loss between days and no differences were
observed in cortical 5-ht loss between days following pchlorophenylalanine treatment. regional brain reductions of
5-ht and 5-hiaa following mdma treatment did not
differ between days.
3.2. effect of p-chlorophenylalanine and mdma on
regional brain [3h]paroxetine binding
mdma treatment resulted in significant reductions in
cortical and hippocampal (fig. 1b, d and f) [3h]paroxetine
binding compared to control animals on all 3 days investigated. hippocampal [3h]paroxetine binding in mdmatreated rats was also significantly reduced compared to pchlorophenylalanine-treated animals on all 3 days, as was
cortical binding on day 1 (fig. 1b, d and f).
p-chlorophenylalanine treatment did not significantly
alter [3h]paroxetine binding in either brain region, with the
exception of cortical binding on day 1 where p-chlorophenylalanine treatment resulted in a significant increase in
[3 h]paroxetine binding compared to both control and
mdma-treated animals (fig. 1b). following either p-chlorophenylalanine or mdma treatment, there were no significant
differences in [3h]paroxetine binding, in either brain region,
between days.
a significant positive correlation was observed between
[3h]paroxetine binding and 5-ht levels in mdma-treated

4. discussion
the irreversible tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, pchlorophenylalanine, produced 69 – 100% reductions in
cortical and hippocampal levels of 5-ht and 5-hiaa on
days 1, 7 and 14 without significantly altering [3h]paroxetine binding, except on day 1, when cortical binding was
significantly increased. in contrast, mdma produced 23 –
41% reductions in cortical and hippocampal 5-ht and 5hiaa, which were associated with 31– 46% reductions in
[3h]paroxetine binding. these data suggest that reductions
of the sert seen following mdma are not related to
functional downregulation in response to low levels of brain
5-ht. instead, they may be related to a functional downregulation in response to some other stimulus, or to the
neurotoxic effects of mdma.
two previous studies have evaluated the influence of pchlorophenylalanine-induced 5-ht depletions on the sert.
however, conclusions from the two studies differed significantly and, in part, prompted the present investigation. our
data are consistent with the report of dewar et al. (1992),
who demonstrated a significant reduction in [3h]paroxetine
binding following administration of another substituted
amphetamine, p-chloroamphetamine, but no such reduction
following p-chlorophenylalanine. as was seen following
mdma administration, treatment with p-chloroamphetamine led to reductions in sert density that were correlated with reductions in 5-ht. in contrast, no changes in the
sert or correlations between sert binding and 5-ht
concentrations were seen following p-chlorophenylalanine
(dewar et al., 1992). however, while rattray et al. (1996)
found no changes in sert binding 2 and 7 days after
treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine, they did observe
significant reductions in sert binding 2 weeks following
administration. this finding could be interpreted as evidence that the sert can be downregulated in response to a
protracted reduction in brain 5-ht content. while the basis
for the disparate findings obtained by rattray et al. is not
entirely clear, they may be due in part to methodological
differences between studies. for example, rattray et al.
(1996) measured sert density in synaptosomal preparations, while sert density was measured in tissue homogenates by dewar et al. (1992) and in the current study.
one explanation for the lack of effect on sert density
seen following p-chlorophenylalanine administration could
be that a sub-optimal dosing regimen was employed. however, this seems unlikely based on the large depletion of 5ht and 5-hiaa observed in both the cortex and hippocampus at all time-points. the use of a second measure of
sert density, [125i]rti-55 binding, further demonstrated
the lack of effect of p-chlorophenylalanine treatment on the
sert, compared to the marked reduction in radioligand
binding observed in mdma-treated animals. in addition,
there is evidence indicating that, although sert mrna
levels in the midbrain raphe region decrease following 5-ht
depletion by acute (yu et al., 1995) or subchronic (linnet et

243

al., 1995) p-chlorophenylalanine administration, levels of
the sert protein are unaltered (yu et al., 1995).
the present findings have implications for imaging
studies evaluating the neurotoxic potential of mdma in
humans. data in numerous animal species (including primates) indicate that mdma is toxic toward brain serotonin
neurones, and that dosages of mdma that produce 5-ht
injury overlap with those commonly used by many mdma
users (ricaurte et al., 1988). nonhuman primates with
documented mdma-induced 5-ht lesions show loss of
the sert as measured by pet, despite the sub-optimal
sensitivity of this method (scheffel et al., 1998). when
considered in concert with the present data suggesting that
mdma-induced reductions of the sert are not a consequence of prolonged 5-ht depletions, use of the sert as a
marker for mdma-induced brain 5-ht neurotoxicity in
living humans seems appropriate.
in conclusion, while both p-chlorophenylalanine and
mdma depleted brain 5-ht, only mdma administration
caused a reduction in sert density. therefore, the results of
the present study suggest that mdma-induced reductions in
the sert are not a result of a functional neuroadaptation to
prolonged drug-induced reductions in brain 5-ht, but may
occur in response to some other stimulus or the neurotoxic
effects of mdma.
