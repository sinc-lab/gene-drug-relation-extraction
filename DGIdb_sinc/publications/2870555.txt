do they affect sports performance?

summary

recent major advances in pharmacological management have provided asthmatics with
a satisfactory range ofdrugs to control asthma. these include  xxxd1763xxx  ( xxxd1763xxx  sodium). hrantagonists. belladonna alkaloids. methyl xanthines. glucocorticoids and
!'l:-adrenoceptor stimulants. despite the tendency for most asthmatics to develop bronchoconstriction after exercise. sport and physical activity are now accepted as valuable in the
overall management of patients with asthma. thus. control of exercise-induced asthma
(eia) is essential. if asthmatics are to participate safely in physical activity and without
respiratory disadvantage in competitive sport. fortunately. inhibition or minimisation of
exercise-induced asthma may be achieved in most asthmatics by pre-exercise aerosol !'l!agonists supplemented if necessary by  xxxd1763xxx  and/or theophylline. regular
medication as required to attain and maintain normal ventilatory function throughout
each day is the objective in all patients with asthma and appears to be a prerequisiste to
control exercise-induced asthma.
the introduction of anti-doping controls into high performance sport has presented
added difficulties for the asthmatic athlete. although not always so. currently all of the
classes of drugs previously noted are acceptable for the treatment of asthma and exerciseinduced asthma. anomalies may exist in the banning of 2 ijradrenoceptor agonists.  xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd2583xxx  (metaprotereno/). all sympathomimetic amines with a- or predominately jj-stimulation are banned. the perpetuation of the need to report the use of
!'l:-agonists prior to competition appears unnecessary.
although relatively little specific research has been undertaken. there is minimal evidence to suggest that asthmatics can derive any additiqnal ergogenic advantagefrom medication to control asthma and exercise-induced asthmil. /l.,-agonists.  xxxd1763xxx 
and glucocorticoids administered by the aerosol route' a~~ not considered to be ergogenic.
some doubts have been raised concerning theophylline and its enhancement of both cardiac and respiratory muscle function. investigations as to the validity of the suggestion that
theophylline could augment physical performance appear warranted. it is reported that
some athletes may be unnecessarily taking oral and perhaps parenteral glucocorticoids to
obtain certain side effects. any decision to ban these agents except for aerosol or local use
could be supported.

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

the disqualification of the winner of the 1972
olympic 400m men's freestyle event because of the
prerace ingestion of an oral anti-asthmatic preparation containing ephedrine sulphate (fitch 1975)
alerted sports physicians throughout the world to
the difficulties for asthmatics competing in international competitions conducted with anti-doping
controls. that the elite athlete with asthma may
require rt:gular medication to control asthma in addition to pre-event therapy for exercise-induced
asthma was clearly demonstrated at the moscow
olympiad (fitch 1984). having won 1 relay gold
medal, a swimmer developed moderately severe
asthma which, despite intensive drug therapy, could
not be adequately controlled; his subsequent performance was severely impaired.
australian olympic teams of 1976 and 1980
contained approximately 9% of competitors with
current or past asthma (fitch 1984); thus it is relevant to examine the relationship between asthma,
its pharmacological management and subsequent
sports performance. is the asthmatic athlete disadvantaged by current anti-doping rules? are most
asthmatics able to achieve adequate control of their
asthma and exercise-induced asthma by ayailable
drugs? do some anti-asthmatic medications impair
or perhaps enhance performance? in an endeavour
to answer these and related questions, the pharmacological agents that are in current use to manage asthma and exercise-induced asthma and their
effects on sports performance (if known) will be
examined in the context of current anti-doping regulations.

1. exercise-induced asthma
although it is more than 300 years since the
first observation that exercise may provoke asthma
(willis 1684) and almost as long since the recognition of the specificity of exercise in the provocation of exercise-induced asthma (floyer 1698), it
was the initial publications of jones et al. (1962),
concerning the effect of exercise on asthmatic
children, that caused the plethora of investigations
into exercise-induced asthma. manygroups of investigators in england, scandinavia, the us, israel,

137

and australia have extensively researched causative factors and a number of major reviews have
been published (anderson et al. 1975; mcfadden
& ingram 1979).
the typical response of a person with asthma
to 6 to 8 minutes of submaximal exercise is to induce bronchoconstriction, which peaks 5 to 10
minutes postexercise and spontaneously resolves
over the next 45 to 60 minutes. intermittent patterns of exercise are less provocative of exerciseinduced asthma than continuous exercise (morton
et al. 1982; schnall & landau 1980), and altering
the duration of submaximal exercise between 8 and
32 minutes did not alter the subsequent exerciseinduced asthma smorton et ai. 1983). although
many theories have been advanced to explain the
occurrence of exercise-induced asthma, no single
causative mechanism appears to satisfy all aspects.
respiratory water loss (chen & horton 1977) is
currently considered to be more important than
respiratory heat loss (deal et al. 1979) and the evidence for this is presented by hahn et al. (1984).

2. history of exercising asthmatics
participation by asthmatics in sport at all levels
may be considered normal since physical recreation and sport have become accepted as part of the
overall management of asthma. in 1982 a symposium in oslo examined in detail the use of exercise as a therapeutic agent in childhood asthma
and the published proceedings are recommended
reading (oseid & edwards 1983).
physical, social and psychological gains have
been documented following physical training programmes conducted for children and adolescents
with asthma. the great advances in tht: pharmacological management of asthma and exerciseinduced asthma have contributed greatly to the involvement of asthmatics in a wide range of sports.
despite the fact that the likely reason for its low
asthmagenicity (reduced respiratory water and heat
loss) has only recently been identified, swimming
has long been a favoured exercise prescription for
asthmatics (oseid & edwards 1983).
at the olympic level, the 24-year unbroken run

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

of medal winning successes by participating asthmatics, mostly in the swimming pool (fitch 1984),
was extended to 28 years in los angeles when us
and australian asthmatics won medals. in 1984 the
us olympic committee compiled a register of
asthmatic athletes, many of whom undertook exercise challenge tests to confirm their exercise
bronchial hyper-reactivity. no less than 67 of the
597 athletes were reported as having exercise-induced asthma [r. yoy, us olympic committee
1984; data submitted to the medical commission
of the international olympic committee (ioc)].
however, the proportion of athletes notified as
having asthma in 1984 is unlikely to truly reflect
the incidence. this is because some athletes without a preceding history of asthma or exercise-induced asthma required the pre-exercise use of aerosol p2-agonists because of air pollution induced
upper and lower airways constriction. eight of the
australian men's hockey team experienced such
problems at the olympic hockey stadium in april
1984, and again during practice sessions prior to
the commencement of the olympiad, and used
prophylactic medication during the games. competitors from other countries are known to have
used prophylactic bronchodilator drugs in certain
outdoor events, e.g. cycling.

3. history of anti-doping rules
the death of a danish cyclist during the lookm
road race at the 1960 rome olympic games, reported to be the consequence of heat stroke and
overdose of both sympathomimetic amines and
vasodilator agents, is generally considered to be the
catalyst to introduce drug testing into the olympics
(prokop 1970). three years later in 1963 the council of europe defined doping as follows:
'doping is defined as the administering or use
of substances in any form alien to the body or of
physiological substances in abnormal amounts and
with abnormal methods by persons with the exclusive aim of attaining an artificial and unfair increase in performance in competition. furthermore, various psychological measures to increase
performance in sports must be regarded as doping.'

138

this definition remains in current use. fortunately for the asthmatic athlete, cognisant of the
fact that some competitors may require legitimate
medication for a medical condition, an amendment was introduced in november 1983:
'where treatment with medicine must be undergone, which as a result of its nature or dosage is
capable of raising physical capability above the
normal level, such treatment must be considered
as doping and shall rule out eligibility for competition.'
the medical commission of the international
olympic committee was appointed in 1967. after
a relatively low key anti-doping campaign at the
mexico city olympic games (1968), the first major olympic drug testing programme began in earnest at the 1972 munich olympiad. at these games,
p2-adrenoceptor stimulants were banned, but  xxxd1763xxx  ( xxxd1763xxx  sodium) methyl xanthines and corticosteroids were permitted.
in 1975, 2 pragonists, salbutamol (albuterol) and
terbutaline were allowed, subject to prior notification. the route of administration was never
specified. in 1984, aerosol rimiterol was permitted.
because of the circumstances in los angeles, particularly the uncertainty of the effects of air pollution on respiratory function during exercise, the
rules were modified to allow notification of the use
of p2-agonists after competition.

4. current status of drugs for asthma
table i contains the permitted classes of drugs
currently available and used in the management of
asthma and exercise-induced asthma. it is evident
that no category of drug in common clinical usage
is banned.
the division of sympathomimetic amines has
until recently been to permit those with prselective properties but to exclude those with any astimulation (many would disagree that  xxxd2583xxx  should be banned) [table ii]. however, a decision in 1984 to ban  xxxd2098xxx  has been on the
basis of its metabolism to d-hydroxyamphetamine
as demonstrated by gas chromatography (c. clausnitzer, unpublished data 1985). further research is

in non-atopic adults with late onset asthma (brogden et al. 1974).  xxxd1763xxx  may be
combined with all other drug classes used to treat
asthma. it is effective in inhibiting or ameliorating
exercise-induced asthma in approximately 70% of
patients with exercise-induced asthma (godfrey &
konig 1976; morton & fitch 1974; wailace &
grieco 1976) [see fig. 1].
the mechanism of action of  xxxd1763xxx  remains unclear. long considered a mast cell
stabiliser (cox 1971) some studies have demonstrated a bronchodilator action, especially when
exercise follows administration (chung & jones
1979; jones et al. 1983; morton & fitch 1974; silverman & andrea 1973; weiner et ai. 1984). however, it must be stressed that  xxxd1763xxx 
will not reverse exercise-induced asthma nor should
it be administered to treat acute asthma; it is most
effective in prophylactic management. to complicate the uncertainty of its action is the ability of
 xxxd1763xxx  to inhibit or reduce the late
onset asthmatic response to exercise (feldman et
ai. 1982; lee et ai. 1982), asthma induced by hyperventilation of cold air (breslin et ai. 1980),
bronchoconstriction induced by exercising while
breathing sulphur dioxide (sheppard et al. 1981)
and airways constriction provoked by distilled
water aerosol (sheppard et ai. 1983).

5.1  xxxd1763xxx 
since its introduction by howell and altounyan
(1967),  xxxd1763xxx  has remained a safe,
effective first-line drug in the prophylactic management of asthma (konig 1984). it appears to have
greater efficacy in ailergic asthma in childhood than

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

 xxxd1763xxx  has no effect on the cardiovascular system (cox & altounyan 1970), is excreted unchanged (ashton et al. 1973; walker et al.
1972) and has never been considered to have any
ergogenic effects. it has no effect on human perceptual, cognitive and motor performance (crawford et al. 1976).  xxxd1763xxx  assists asthmatics to control both their asthma and their
exercise-induced asthma and this constitutes the
sole mechanism by which physical performance
may be enhanced.

5.2 hi-antagonists
h i-receptor antagonists are not considered to
have any significant role in the management of
asthma but are often prescribed for atopic asthmatics to control symptoms associated with other
manifestations of atopy, e.g. nasal, dermatological.
because of the possible involvement of both histamine and a parasympathetic pathway in the production of exercise-induced asthma, a number of
recent studies have noted mild to moderate inhibition of exercise-induced asthma by oral thiazinamium (zielinski & chodosowska 1977), aerosol
c1emastine (hartley & nogrady 1980) and aerosol
chlorpheniramine (schachter & rubin 1985).
however, hi-blocking agents are unlikely to be
utilised in preference to other anti-asthmatic medications. nevertheless, enhancement of performance could not occur since depression of the central nervous system follows therapeutic doses of h 1blockers with a somnolence. furthermore, no significant effects on the cardiovascular system have
been observed following administration of h ,-antagonists (douglas 1980).

5.3 belladonna alkaloids
the role of the parasympathetic system in the
mechanism of asthma remains in doubt. nevertheless, atropine and derivatives may produce a
significant bronchodilator action. the development of ipratropium bromide, a quarternary ammonium derivative of atropine with potent anticholinergic properties but minor atropine-like side

140

effects, has proved to have a role in the management of asthma (poppius & saloninne 1973). administered by the aerosol route, ipratropium bromide is a useful bronchodilator for patients who
cannot tolerate or do not respond to i32-adrenoceptor stimulants (furukawa 1984) and is considered
to be more effective in patients with chronic bronchitis (baigelman & chodose 1977).
the ability of anticholinergic agents to inhibit
exercise-induced asthma is in some dispute. since
jones et al. (1963) noted a partial blocking effect
by atropine on exercise-induced asthma in children, many investigators have attempted to evaluate
the effects of anticholinergic drugs on exercise-induced asthma. mcneill et al. (1966) found no effect with intravenous atropine. godfrey & konig
(1976) reported a modest effect with aerosol atropine methonitrate. tinkelman et al. (1976) used
much higher doses atropine (0.1 mg/kg) of nebulised atropine to achieve inhibition of exercise-induced asthma in 17 of 18 children with chronic
perennial asthma, all of whom developed xerostomia persisting for up to 4 hours. neither ipratropium bromide nor  xxxd247xxx  administered by aerosol pre-exercise specifically inhibited
exercise-induced asthma in the 20 atopic children
with asthma studied by borut et al. (1977). these
results contrast to those of chan-yeung (1977) and
thomson et al. (1978) who found that ipratropium
bromide compared favourably with sodium
 xxxd1763xxx  in preventing exercise-induced
asthma and of hartley & davies (1980) who observed that larger doses of ipratropium bromide
were more effective.
despite the markedly reduced side effects of
even larger doses of aerosol ipratropium bromide,
a consequence of its inability to pass the bloodbrain barrier, it is unlikely to achieve any significant role in the prevention of exercise-induced
asthma because its efficacy cannot compare with
i32-agonists in either prevention or reversal of exercise-induced asthma. nevertheless, there is no
evidence in any of the aforementioned studies that
aerosol anticholinergic agents will enhance performance except via possible protection from exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

5.4 methyl xanthines
theophylline and  xxxd150xxx  (theophylline
ethylenediamine) have been widely used in the
treatment of asthma, especially in the us for almost half a century. therapeutic efficacy has been
improved by a greater understanding of the need
to maintain certain serum concentrations (jenne et
al. 1972) and by published guidelines established
to adjust theophylline dosage after interpretation
of these serum concentration values (hendeles et
al. 1978). the recent introduction of a sustained
release preparation (jonkman et al. 1981) has increased interest in theophylline with hopes of enhanced patient compliance to the drug and better
tolerance to therapy but perhaps with greater risks
of adverse reactions (ellis 1984b).
in the management of asthma, theophylline has
proved to be an effective bronchodilator, especially
in the hands of clinicians with experience of this
drug (ekwo & weinberger 1978). it is comparable
with  xxxd1763xxx  in inhibiting exerciseinduced asthma (pollock et al. 1977) and those
studies which have confirmed its usefulness in the
management of exercise-induced asthma have been
summarised recently by ellis (1984a). although
never considered to be a doping agent, ellis has
raised doubts that the extrapulmonary effects of
theophylline may justify a closer examination.
aubier et al. (1981) have demonstrated  xxxd150xxx  at a mean serum concentration of 13 Â±
0.9 ~gjml improves diaphragmatic contractility in
normal subjects and renders it less suceptible to
fatigue. subsequent studies in dogs (aubier et al.
1983), have disclosed that this improvement was
primarily in the contractile properties of the diaphragm and not via any central nervous system
effect. forearm blood flow was increased significantly and proportional to serum concentrations
when normal volunteers were given increasing
theophylline concentrations intravenously (ogilvie
et al. 1977). increases in heart rate, a reduction of
cardiac preload and an increase in inotropy were
noted in the same normal subjects with concentrations of between 10 to 20 ~g/ml. however, no consistent alterations in either stroke volume or ejec-

141

tion fraction were observed in the 4 subjects
studied, the variable responses being unrelated to
serum theophylline levels, an occurrence reported
by earlier investigators (ogilvie et al. 1977).
other studies involving strenuous treadmill
running by asthmatic children (chryssanthopoulos
et al. 1984) and radionuclide assessment of cardiac
function during submaximal cycle ergometry in
patients with cystic fibrosis (canny et al. 1984) did
not reveal any augmentation of cardiac function
when theophylline was administered pre-exercise.
matthay et al. (1982) have confirmed the sustained, modest improvement in resting biventricular performance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease after treatment with
orai theophylline. furthermore, theophylline has
been shown to increase the intensity and duration
of the cardioactive state of isolated papillary muscle
(marcus et al. 1972). thus, as a stimulant of the
central nervous system and mild diuretic (ellis
1984b), the ability to augment the contractility of
cardiac and diaphragmatic muscle with consequent
effects on cardiorespiratory function, ellis's suggestion that theophylline may enhance human
physical performance justifies further investigation. however, on the negative aspect are the gastric side effects that often accompany theophylline
administration at levels to attain maximal therapeutic effect. the athlete in major competitions,
often with a hyperactive gastrointestinal tract from
pregame or pre-event 'nerves', is not very tolerant
of medication which has nausea and vomiting as
its principal side effects.
it is relevant to report that in 1984, the medical
commission of the ioc included caffeine in its
banned list of drugs, should the urinary level exceed 15 ~gjml. caffeine (1,3,  xxxd404xxx )
is closely related chemically and pharrilacologically
to theophylline ( xxxd3344xxx ). caffeine has
recently been demonstrated to be an effective
bronchodilator in children and adolescents with
asthma (becker et al. 1984) although the authors
did not recommend the regular use of caffeine as
a bronchodilator. it seems essential that before
banning theophylline, double-blind studies must be
undertaken using well-trained athletes as subjects

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

to determine if maximum performance is increased following theophylline administration.
5.5 glucocorticosteroids
the value of oral and intravenous glucocorticosteroid agents in severe chronic asthma (walsh
& grant 1966) and in life-threatening asthma
(grant 1966) is universally accepted. the mechanism of their anti-asthmatic action remains obscure (middleton 1975). the introduction of  xxxd294xxx , a chlorinated analogue
of betamethasone with a topical anti-inflammatory
action has resulted in the availability of a therapeutic agent which is directed at the target organ,
the bronchial tree (morrow-brown et al. 1972). a
major advantage of aerosol administration has been
the reduction or cessation of oral corticosteroids in
many asthmatics who had been controlled previously on this regimen (brompton hospital/medical research council collaborative trial, 1974;
jones 1973). this has greatly minimised the negative effect of exogenous corticosteroids on endogenous production (harris et al. 1973).
the effectiveness of corticosteroid agents in exercise-induced asthma is doubtful. mcneill et al.
(1966) noted that exercise-induced asthma was unaffected by pre-exercise intravenous hydrocortisone. konig et al. (1974) observed amelioration of
exercise-induced asthma in a third of9 subjects after
a week of oral prednisone therapy, but aerosol beclomethasone administered pre-exercise while improving some patients, was followed by exerciseinduced asthma of increased severity in others. analysis of the data of hartley et al. (1977) revealed
a variable response with 3 patients being worse and
7 patients improved after regular aerosol therapy
with aerosol  xxxd322xxx  compared with
placebo. inferior protection against exercise-induced asthma was afforded by regular and pre-exercise  xxxd3418xxx  (yazigi et al. 1978).
however, a recent study in which a new non-halogenated corticosteroid with topical anti-inflammatory properties (budesonide) was administered
twice a day for 4 weeks, improved both resting pulmonary function and the effect of pre-exercise low

142

dose aerosol terbutaline on exercise-induced asthma
(henriksen & dahl 1983). this tends to confirm
the clinical experience that the principal value of
aerosol glucocorticoids for athletes is as maintenance therapy to control asthma, with aerosol fhagonists administered pre-exercise to inhibit exercise-induced asthma. although no studies have
specifically examined this question, no ergogenic
effect could be anticipated from therapeutic doses
of aerosol corticosteroid agents used prior to competition by asthmatic athletes.
however, concern exists that some athletes including cyclists and weightlifters have been taking
large doses of glucocorticoids just prior to or during competition. a 23% mean increase in cardiac
output was reported when 9 normal subjects were
given a single large intravenous dose of one of several glucocorticoids (sambhi et al. 1965). elevation
of mood, with euphoria, restlessness and increased
motor activity in some persons may follow large
doses of oral glucocorticoids (haynes & murad
1980). these consequences must be deemed to have
the potential to enhance performance and thus a
decision to ban corticosteroid agents except for
topical or local use may be justified.
5.6 sympathomimetic amines
since bronchial airway tone is under the influence of the sympathetic nervous system, sympathomimetic amines including endogenous catecholamines and synthetic preparations with similar
actions have a significant role in the status ofbronchial smooth muscle. the naturally occurring catecholamines - adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) affect many target
organs. in 1948, ahlquist divided adrenergic receptors into 2 categories, a and fl. included in the
many functions of sympathomimetic amines are
those of a cardiac excitory nature with increases in
both heart rate and the force of myocardial contraction and of central nervous system stimulation
with increased wakefulness, reduced appetite and
heightened psychomotor activity (weiner 1980). it
is by such actions, which are believed by some to
augment human physical performance, that have

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

led to gross abuse of such stimulants by competitors in certain sports. for this reason, many have
been included in the list of banned drugs (medical
commission, ioc, 1984).

5.6.1 adrenaline (epinephrine)
adrenaline is a powerful bronchodilator, particularly evident when bronchial smooth muscle is
contracted as a consequence of asthma and drug
or antigen-induced responses. it increases both respiratory rate and tidal volume. reduction of oedema and congestion by vasoconstriction of the
bronchial mucosa, an a-receptor function, is important in the therapeutic effectiveness of adrenaline. clinically, its principal uses have been to relieve respiratory distress due to acute bronchospasm
and as an emergency treatment for acute hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions (weiner 1980).
adrenaline was demonstrated by jones et al.
(1963) and mcneil et al. (1966) to be effective in
preventing exercise-induced asthma. however, because of the need for parenteral administration and
possibly an earlier concern that refractoriness to
adrenaline may arise after prolonged use, it has not
been utilised to control exercise-induced asthma.
it is the treatment of choice for exercise-induced
anaphylaxis (sheffer & austen 1984).
adrenaline is a very potent vasopressor agent,
a consequence of the triad of increasing the strength
of ventricular contraction, provoking tachycardia
and inducing widespread vasoconstriction. it is also
prone to induce ventricular arrhythmias (weiner
1980). since at least in theory adrenaline could enhance performance, it is included in the list of
banned sympathomimetic amines.

5.6.2 ephedrine
ephedrine stimulates both a- and ,b-receptors. it
is a relatively weak bronchodilator, prone to the
rapid development of tachyphylaxis (weiner 1980).
formerly, ephedrine was used in mild chronic
asthma usually in a combination tablet with oral
theophylline, but it has little current clinical use.
jones et al. (1963) found ephedrine (0.8 to 1.0
mg/kg) moderately effective in preventing exerciseinduced asthma in contrast to bierman et al. (1975)

143

who could not distinguish the preventive effect of
ephedrine sulphate 25mg from placebo.
ephedrine has cardiovascular effects roughly
similar to adrenaline but which persist for about
10 times as long. myocardial contraction and cardiac output are augmented and the systolic blood
pressure and the pulse pressure elevated. tremor,
restlessness, insomnia, agitation and increased motor activity, which are the consequences of amphetamine on the central nervous system, are also
induced by ephedrine, but these effects are less
marked (weiner 1980).
since doping contrqls were introduced, ephedrine has been a banned substance. it was the agent
used by 3 of the 7 athletes who were found to have
practised doping at the munich olympics (m.
donike, personal communication). ephedrine is
banned because of its cardiac-stimulating and mood
elevating actions. whether it actually enhances human physical performance remains unanswered.
sidney and lefcoe (1977) found no ergogenic effect
when 24mg of ephedrine hydrochloride was given
to 21 males without chest disease and could find
no documented evidence in their literature survey
that ephedrine improved performance. a subsequent study combining 130mg of theophylline with
24mg of ephedrine demonstrated a significant 4%
increase in dynamic muscle endurance which may
be the effect of theophylline (sidney & lefcoe 1978).

5.6.3  xxxd2398xxx  ( xxxd2401xxx )
 xxxd2398xxx  is a powerful stimulant of all .b-receptors with negligible effects on a-receptors. because it is rapidly inactivated in the intestine following oral ingestion, a sublingual preparation was
utilised, but proved unreliable. the common routes
of administration are by aerosol inhalation and by
injection; the latter is predominately used as a
cardiac stimulant (weiner 1980).  xxxd2398xxx  did
prove an effective and widely used aerosol bronchodilator in the management of asthma, but prone
to overutilisation because of its short duration of
action (sly 1984). it has been superceded by .br
selective adrenoceptor stimulant aerosols with less
.b,-stimulation and potential risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

jones et al. (1963) were the first to determine
the effects of  xxxd2398xxx  on exercise-induced
asthma. moderate prevention of exercise-induced
asthma was noted after aerosol administration, but
oral  xxxd2398xxx  was of little value. the short but
effective period of protection against exercise-induced asthma afforded by aerosol  xxxd2398xxx  was
confirmed by sly et al. (1966).
currently,  xxxd2398xxx  has virtually no place in
the management of asthma and exercise-induced
asthma in the athlete. it is classed as a doping agent
because of its cardiac-stimulating properties, its
principal use in clinical medicine today.
5.6.4ijradrenoceptor stimulants
general considerations
the differentiation by lands et al. (1967) of receptor systems activated by sympathomimetic
amines into ,81-mediating ,8-adrenergic effects on
the heart, intestinal muscle and lipolysis and ,82 affecting the smooth muscle of bronchi, uterus and
arteries supplying skeletal muscle has been followed by the development of several ,82-agonist
drugs with superior bronchodilator actions.
a resorcinol derivative of the archetype ,8adrenoceptor stimulant  xxxd2398xxx , was developed in 1961 and as orciprenaiine was the first ,82"
selective agonist (jack 1971). later that decade, a
n-tertiary butyl homologue of  xxxd2583xxx , terbutaline, was found to be twice as potent as its
parent compound, but with only 25% of its cardiac
effects (bergman et al. 1969). about the same time
a saligenin analogue of  xxxd2398xxx , (isoproteremol), salbutamol (albuterol), was developed (jack
1971) soon followed by  xxxd2098xxx , the hydroxyphenyl derivative of  xxxd2583xxx  (mattila et al.
1967) and rimiterol, a short acting ,82-selective
agonist which retains the catechol group and is susceptible to degradation by catechol-o methyltransferase (pinder et al. 1977). the latter like  xxxd2398xxx , is inactive orally.
 xxxd2583xxx 
 xxxd2583xxx  ( xxxd2583xxx ) is primarily a ,82"
adrenoceptor agonist with little ,8 i-receptor activity

144

(weiner 1980). it is available as oral, aerosol and
parenteral preparations.  xxxd2583xxx  is a potent
and safe bronchodilator effective in the management of asthma (hurst 1973). it is also effective in
the prevention of exercise-induced asthma when
1.5mg is administered by metered aerosol 15 minutes prior to exercise (schoeffel et al. 1981). konig
et al. (1981) observed a marked superiority of inhaled  xxxd2583xxx  over the oral preparation in inhibiting exercise-induced asthma.  xxxd2583xxx  will
rapidly reverse ex~rcise-induced asthma.
 xxxd2583xxx  has been classed as a doping agent
by the medical commission of the ioc. this decision may be rather harsh in view of the findings
of beardshaw et al. (1974) who noted no significant
alteration in either heart rate or blood pressure after
1.5 and 3.0mg of inhaled  xxxd2583xxx  and ofence
et al. (1979) who detected no effect on either heart
rate or left ventricular performance in asthmatics
given 2mg orally.
salbutamol, terbutaline,  xxxd2098xxx 
and rimiterol
because of the great similarity of pharmacological properties and clinical effectiveness, these 4 ,82"
adrenoceptor stimulants will be examined together. rimiterol is available only for aerosol
administration,  xxxd2098xxx  for both oral and aerosol
and terbutaline and salbutamol may be given orally,
parenterally and by the aerosol routes.
they are the most potent bronchodilators currently available although a number of studies have
demonstrated marginal differences in their efficacy. an overall appraisal of the data available leads
one to conclude that all 4 drugs are highly effective
and approximately equal in their clinical responses
(blackball et al. 1976; choo-kang et al. 1969; grafflonnerig 1976; huhti & poukkula 1978; madsen
et al. 1979; minette 1971; riedel-dibbern & leblanc 1972; shenfield & paterson 1973; simonsson
et al. 1972; vanderschueren et al. 1979). because
the aerosol therapeutic dose (1 to 2 puffs) is 5 to
10% of the oral dose with side effects, notably
tremor, correspondingly reduced and the onset of
action being extremely rapid, the aerosol route of
administration is preferred by most investigators

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

145

(grimwood et al. 1981; groggins et al. 1980; prime
1971; schumann & herxheimer 1971) although
some authors favour a combination of oral and
aerosol therapy (larsson & svedmyr 1977) [see fig.
2].
the duration of action of these 4 ,82-adrenoceptor stimulants has not been fully evaluated (sly
1984). after oral administration, salbutamol, terbutaline and  xxxd2098xxx  are believed to provide
bronchodilation for up to 6 hours. following aerosol administration, despite some conflicting evidence it appears that rimiterol has the shortest action (pinder et al. 1977). salbutamol and terbutaline
are effective for similar and intermediate periods
and  xxxd2098xxx  has the longest duration of action.
effects may be significant for up to 6 hours after
standard aerosol administration, i.e. 2 puffs of metered aerosol (graff-lonnerig, 1970; huhti &

time (hours)

fig. 2. assessment of duration of drug action by suppression
of exercise-induced asthma in studies carried out on 3 separate
days. on each occasion drug or placebo was given before first
test of morning, and exercise tests were then repeated every 2
hours without further medication. results are expressed as
postexercise fa" in peak expiratory flow rate (pefr); measure
of exercise-induced asthma remained constant with exercise
tests repeated every 2 hours on placebo day. inhaled salbutamol suppressed exercise-induced asthma immediately, and effect steadily wore off throughout the day. orally administered
salbutamol had no effect immediately after swallowing tablet,
but was fully effective after 2 hours (fitch & godfrey 1976).

poukkula 1978; manicatide et al. 1973; riedeldibber & leblanc 1972; simonsson et al. 1972).
in the prevention of exercise-induced asthma
terbutaline, salbutamol and  xxxd2098xxx  have been
proven equally effective and are the drugs of choice,
being superior to all other categories (godfrey
1984). [rimiterol has not been extensively evaluated in exercise-induced asthma, but clinically its
effectiveness is apparently equivalent to the other
3 drugs.] oral preparations are comparatively ineffective and cannot be recommended except in
young children who cannot manipulate aerosols.
an additional advantage is the rapidity with which
aerosol ,82-agonists will reverse exercise-induced
asthma. (anderson et a!. 1975, 1976, 1979; rosenthal et a!. 1979; sly 1984; sturani et al. 1983).
almost all studies have confirmed the absence
of cardiovascular side effects following standard
aerosol administration of these ,8rreceptor stimulants. (graff-lonnevig 1976; manicatide et al. 1973;
nayler 1971; nayler & mcinnes 1972; riedel-dibbern & leblanc 1972). even with increasing dosage
with aerosol (simonsson et al. 1972) and oral and
aerosol ,82-receptor stimulants (larsson & svedmyr
1977) no cardiovascular stimulation was observed.
the principal and in some patients the dose-limiting side effect was tremor, more severe following
oral than aerosol therapy (larsson & svedmyr
1977). one recent report has noted substantial increases in cardiac output at rest following standard
doses of metered aerosol  xxxd2098xxx  (chapman et a!.
1984). these canadian researchers used echocardiography and noted increased stroke volume and
decreased total peripheral resistance with only minor alterations in heart rate and blood pressure.
intravenous salbutamol has produced tachycardia
and hypokalaemia as well as an increase in plasma
insulin and glucose levels and tremor when infused
into normal males (leitch et a!. 1976) and in
patients with mild chronic bronchial asthma (neville et a!. 1977). the latter study noted no such
effects occurred after aerosol administration. ingemann-hansen et a!. (1980) found no differences
in v0 2 max between nebulised salbutamol (5mg in
2ml saline) or saline (0.9%) in 5 male asthmatics
subjected to cycle ergometry. no exercise-induced

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

asthma supervened after either control or premedicated maximal tests. these authors concluded
that no ergogenic effect resulted from the pretest
administration of aerosol salbutamol.
currently salbutamol and terbutaline (since
1915) and rimiterol (since 1984) are the only sympathomimetic agents allowed by the medical commission of the ioc.  xxxd2098xxx  is not permitted.
there is a need to reappraise the availability of fhadrenoceptor stimulants and the necessity to notify
their use prior to competition. since athletes undertaking doping tests must complete a form listing
all medications taken in the days prior to their
event, asthmatics requiring {:l2-agonists will have to
list their drug therapy. hence, separate notification
seems unnecessary. furthermore, as oral medication with these agents is considerably less effective
than aerosol preparations, limiting the availability
to aerosol preparations without the need to notify
their use in advance seems to be logical. asthmatics whose asthma is severe enough to warrant
parenteral {:l-agonists will be to ill too compete in
sporting activity.
5.7 other agents and management of
asthma
a number of other agents which affect bronchial
reactivity have been examined iii respect of their
effectiveness in the management of asthma. these
have included agents with a sodium cromoglycatelike structure or function, ketotifen, an orally active antihistamine with antianaphylactic activity,
a-adrenergic blocking agents and calcium channel
blockers (furakawa 1984). none have achieved any
significant role in the current management of either
asthma or exercise-induced asthma. nifedipine, a
calcium antagonist was reported to provide a high
degree of protection from exercise-induced asthma
without any pre-exercise bronchodilator effect
(cerrina et al. 1981; patel 1982).
5.8 drug combinations
many asthmatics require more than one drug to
maintain control of their bronchial airways. the

146

combination of either  xxxd1763xxx  or
aerosol glucocorticoid (occasionally both) with a
{:l2-adrenoceptor stimulant is common. many
patients find that regular theophylline to achieve
serum concentrations in the therapeutic range of
10 to 20 /tg/ml is necessary in addition to any combination of the above 3 drug categories. ipratropium bromide and hi-antagonists are occasionally
prescribed and may prove to be a valuable adjunct
to therapy.
in the control of exercise-induced asthma most
authorities recommend that pre-exercise aerosol fir
agonist supplemented if necessary by sodium
 xxxd1763xxx  as the treatment of choice (anderson
et al. 1979; fitch & godfrey 1976; godfrey 1984;
pierson 1983). modification of the timing of the
pre-exercise dose of  xxxd1763xxx  is important to provide maximum protection because
of its brief period of protection (morton et al. 1981;
silverman & andrea 1973). maintenance therapy
with theophylline and/or aerosol glucocorticoids
may be combined and appear to assist in the control of exercise-induced asthma (cummings &
strunk 1984; godfrey 1984; henriksen & dahl,
1983). there is no conclusive evidence that combinations of drugs have any summation effect and
enhanced protection from several drugs reflects the
fact that each asthmatic must discover the best
therapy to control his or her exercise bronchial
hyper-responsiveness (cummings & strunk 1984;
patel 1983).

6. conclusions
recent major advances in the pharmacological
management of asthma and exercise-induced
asthma have provided for the athlete with asthma
an excellent range of medications to control their
bronchoconstriction at rest and on exertion. with
the exception of theophylline, these agents are administered by the aerosol route, thus permitting
rapid onset of action and reduced systemic effects.
it is pleasing to record that most ofthese drugs are
acceptable to the international olympic committee and international sports federations. the current exceptions are  xxxd2098xxx  and  xxxd2583xxx 

anti-asthmatic drugs and sport

( xxxd2583xxx ). thus, the national or international athlete with asthma is not disadvantaged by
existing anti-<ioping regulations.
few investigators have specifically examined the
effect of these drugs on performance. numerous
studies over the last 2 decades and much clinical
experience have demonstrated that with control of
exercise-induced asthma the majority of asthmatics can compete with their peer normals without
additional respiratory disadvantage. in this respect, medication by normalising bronchial hyperreactivity does assist performance. the question as
to whether any additional ergogenic effect may be
consequent upon the use of such drug therapy has
received scant attention. both theophylline and oral
and parenteral glucocorticoids have been shown to
have, at least on theoretical grounds, the potential
to be ergogenic. further studies are required to determine the validity of these suggestions.
