antagonism by antidepressants of neurotransmitter receptors of normal human brain in vitro.  using radioligand binding techniques, we determined the equilibrium dissociation constants (kds) for a series of antidepressants at the histamine h1, muscarinic acetylcholine, alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic and dopamine (d-2) receptors of normal human brain tissue obtained at autopsy. twenty-five different antidepressants were studied at all but the d-2 receptor at which the number was 13 (including a metabolite of an antidepressant). of all the receptor interactions studied, that at the  xxxg1078xxx  was in general the most potent interaction of this class of compounds, corresponding to results from studies using animal tissue as the source of receptors. at the human brain  xxxg1078xxx , antidepressants remained among the most potent histamine h1 antagonists known, although their affinities for human receptors were lower than those for animal receptors. the most potent and the least potent compounds at the receptors were doxepin (kd = 0.24 nm) and fluvoxamine (kd = 109 microm) at the  xxxg1078xxx , amitriptyline (kd = 18 nm) and trazodone (kd = 324 microm) at the muscarinic receptor, doxepin (kd = 24 nm) and viloxazine (kd = 14 microm) at the alpha-1 receptor,  xxxd2637xxx  (kd = 73 nm) and bupropion (kd = 81 microm) at the alpha-2 receptor and  xxxd160xxx  (kd = 160 nm) and trazodone (kd = 3800 nm) at the d-2 receptor, respectively. in general, compared to older drugs, the newer compounds tended to have lower affinities for these receptors.
