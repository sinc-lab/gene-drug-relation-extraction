contribution of the histaminergic receptor subtypes to histamine-induced cerebellar granular neurotoxicity.  in the present study, we investigated the effects of histamine and its specific h(1), h(2) and h(3) receptor blockers in cerebellar granular cell culture derived from rat pups. histamine was applied  xxxd1891xxx (-9),10(-8), 10(-7),10(-6), and 10(-5) m for 16 h into the cultures and the highest dose was found to be the most toxic one.  xxxd2906xxx  (h(1) receptor blocker), ranitidine (h(2) receptor blocker) and thioperamide (h(3) receptor blocker) were applied  xxxd1891xxx (-8), 10(-7), 10(-6), 10(-5) m into the flasks prior to histamine in the second step of the experiments. also, the effect of all of the blockers together  xxxd1891xxx (-5) m concentrations was tested on the toxicity induced by 10(-5) m histamine. the h(3) receptor blocker, thioperamide (10(-6) m) was demonstrated to be most effective histamine toxicity blocker. histamine h(2) blocker, ranitidine, was found to attenuate histamine neurotoxicity at all doses tested, its most effective dose being the highest dose. on the other hand, h(1) blocker,  xxxd2906xxx , was able to reverse the effect of histamine  xxxd1891xxx (-6) and 10(-5) m, but it was found ineffective when given  xxxd1891xxx (-9) and 10(-8) m. combined application of h(1), h(2), and h(3) receptor blockers  xxxd1891xxx (-5) m concentrations, 45 min before histamine addition into the flasks  xxxd1891xxx (-5) m, was able to reduce cell death score but it was not as effective as h(3) blocker, thioperamide.
