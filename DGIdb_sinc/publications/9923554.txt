antitumor activity of 2-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-2-¯uoro-b-d-arabinofuranosyl)
adenine, a novel deoxyadenosine analog, against human colon tumor
xenografts by oral administration
received: 20 february 1998 / accepted: 29 june 1998

abstract 2-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-2-¯uoro-b-d-arabinofuranosyl) adenine ( xxxd1722xxx ) is a novel deoxyadenosine
analog, which inhibits dna synthesis by inhibiting
dna polymerase a and ribonucleotide reductase. cl- xxxd2120xxx  shows potent antiproliferative activity against
several leukemic cell lines including those of human
origin and is also eective against murine solid tumors,
in particular being curative against colon tumors.
purpose: we therefore decided to investigate whether clf-araa is eective against human colon tumors, in
particular by oral administration, since it has improved
stability compared with other deoxyadenosine analogs.
methods: antiproliferative activity in vitro was determined from cell counts. subcutaneously inoculated
xenograft models and a liver micrometastases model
were used for assessment of antitumor activity in vivo.
results:  xxxd1722xxx  showed potent antiproliferative
activity against four human colon tumor cell lines
(hct116, ht-29, dld-1, widr), with a 50% growthinhibitory concentration (ic50) of 0.26 lm with a 72-h
exposure. this activity was greater than those of
¯udarabine desphosphate and cladribine, other deoxyadenosine analogs, which showed ic50 values of 19 lm
and 0.35 lm, respectively.  xxxd1722xxx  showed potent
antitumor activity against four human colon tumor
xenograft models (ht-29, widr, co-3, colo-320dm)
in a 5-day daily administration schedule, which was
shown to be the most eective of three administration
regimens tested (single, twice-weekly, 5-day daily). in
particular, oral administration showed signi®cantly superior activity, with a regressive or cytostatic growth
curve, compared with intravenous administration. in
addition,  xxxd1722xxx  was eective at only one-sixteenth

of the maximum dose tested in a 10-day daily administration schedule. therapeutic eciency seemed to increase in proportion to the frequency of administration.
 xxxd1722xxx  also decreased liver micrometastases created
by intrasplenic injection of human colon tumor cells,
leading to complete suppression at the maximum dose
tested. conclusions: these results suggest that  xxxd1722xxx 
might be clinically eective against human colon cancers
using a daily oral administration schedule.

introduction
antimetabolites have been widely used to treat a variety
of tumors. 2-chloro-9-(2-deoxy-2-¯uoro-b-d-arabinofuranosyl) adenine ( xxxd1722xxx ) is the latest deoxyadenosine analog to be synthesized. the drug has a chloride
at the c2 position of deoxyadenosine and a ¯uoride in
the 2¢-arabino moiety. therefore, the drug is resistant to
deamination and the phosphorolytic cleavage, which are
involved in the inactivation of several antimetabolites [3,
15]. to exert its cytotoxic eect,  xxxd1722xxx  requires intracellular phosphorylation by  xxxg611xxx 
( xxxg611xxx ) [3], which is a rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage
pathway of pyrimidine nucleosides and has broad substrate speci®city [1, 2], before ®nally being metabolized
to the corresponding triphosphate form, cl-f-araatp
[29]. cl-f-araatp inhibits both dna polymerase a
( xxxd81xxx ) and ribonucleotide reductase (rnr) [17, 30],
like the triphosphate forms of ¯udarabine and cladribine
[6, 16, 26], which have been used clinically alone and in
combination for the treatment of hematological malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll)
[11, 13, 18], low-grade lymphoma [12, 21], hairy cell
leukemia (hcl) [19, 24] and acute myelogenous leukemia [4]. the concentration of cl-f-araatp required to
inhibit  xxxd81xxx  is similar to that of ¯udarabine or cladribine, whereas the concentration for rnr inhibition is

234

the same as that of cladribine, but tenfold less than that
of ¯udarabine [17].
 xxxd1722xxx  shows potent cytotoxicity against several
leukemic cell lines including those of human origin
[3, 15], and is eective against murine tumor syngeneic
models such as p388 leukemia, colon 36 and mammary
16/c [27]. interestingly,  xxxd1722xxx  is curative against
both early and advanced stages of colon 36 tumors.
however, its eect on human solid tumors has not yet
been determined.
 xxxd1722xxx  has the advantages over other deoxyadenosine analogs of being stable in acidic solution and
resistant to the phosphorolytic cleavage [3, 15]. a
pharmacokinetic study in rats has suggested that the
drug might show antitumor activity when administered
orally because the bioavailability of  xxxd1722xxx  is approximately 50% [20]. therefore,  xxxd1722xxx  might be
eective when administered orally as well as by the intravenous route. in this study, we studied particularly
tumors of the colon and investigated whether  xxxd1722xxx 
was eective against human tumors, particularly by oral
administration using subcutaneously inoculated xenograft models and a liver micrometastases model.

materials and methods
chemicals and tumor cells
 xxxd1722xxx  (fig. 1) was provided by southern research institute
(birmingham, ala.).  xxxd2120xxx  desphosphate (2-¯uoroadenine-9b-d-arabinofuranoside) and cladribine (2-chloro-2¢-deoxyadenosine) were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo.).
human colon tumor cell lines (hct116, ht-29, dld-1, widr)
were obtained from the american type culture collection
(rockville, md.). these cell lines were maintained each in its most
suitable medium (mccoy 5a for hct116, rpmi-1640 for ht-29
and dld-1, and mem for widr) with 10% fetal bovine serum
(life technologies, grand island, n.y.) at 37 °c in a humidi®ed
atmosphere of 5% co2 in air for evaluating antiproliferative activity in vitro. ht-29, widr and colo-320dm tumor xenografts
were established by inoculating subcutaneously each type of cultured cells into 6±8-week-old male balb/c-nu/nu mice (nude mice)
obtained from clea japan (tokyo, japan). co-3, lc-6, qg-56,
lx-1, mx-1 and ns-8 tumor xenografts were supplied by the
central institute of experimental animals (kanagawa, japan) and
maintained subcutaneously in the ¯ank of nude mice.

antiproliferative activity
cells were precultured for 24 h at 37 °c in a humidi®ed atmosphere
of 5% co2 in air. the cells were exposed to various concentrations
of drugs for 72 h. the cells were counted using a microcell counter
(sysmex f-300, toa medical electronics, hyogo, japan). the
concentration of drugs required for 50% inhibition of cell growth
(ic50) was calculated and is taken to represent the antiproliferative
activity. the mean ic50 is expressed as the mean log ic50 of each
drug against the four tumor cell lines.
antitumor activity
tumor fragments of approximately 8 mm3 were inoculated subcutaneously into the ¯ank of nude mice (n  3±5). when the tumor reached a volume of between 50 and 300 mm3, drugs were
administered in the indicated schedule. the lengths and widths of
the tumors were measured twice weekly and tumor volumes were
calculated according to the following formula: length ´ width ´
width ´ 0.5. drug ecacy against tumor xenografts is expressed in
terms of t/c minimum (t/c min) which is the lowest mean value of
v/v0 of the treated group versus that of the control group during
the observation period after ®rst drug treatment, where v was the
tumor volume on the day of evaluation and v0 was the tumor
volume on the day of ®rst drug treatment (day 0). body weight
change is shown relative to that observed on day 0. the statistical
signi®cance of dierences was analyzed using the mann-whitney
u-test and the results were considered signi®cant when t/cmin was
less than 50% and the p-value was less than 0.05.
liver micrometastases
nude mice (n  6) were anesthetized with pentobarbital by intraperitoneal injection and the abdomen was prepared for sterile
surgery. a small abdominal incision was made and the spleen was
isolated. a single-cell suspension of 5 ´ 105 ht-29 human colon
tumor cells in 0.05 ml hanks' solution (nissui pharmaceutical co.,
tokyo, japan) containing 1% serum of nude mice and 10 units/ml
heparin (shimizu pharmaceutical co., shizuoka, japan) was slowly
injected into the spleen using a 27-gauge needle. the spleen was
returned to the abdominal cavity and the wound was closed with
sutures. drug administration was initiated 6 days after the tumor
injection and was given in a 5-day daily oral administration
schedule at doses in the range 25±100 mg/kg per day. there were
no postoperative deaths. the liver micrometastasis burden at 4
weeks after the tumor injection was scored by counting tumor foci
of >2 mm in diameter. statistical signi®cance was analyzed using
the steel test and the results were considered signi®cant when the
p-value was less than 0.05.

we investigated the antiproliferative activity of cl- xxxd2120xxx  and two other deoxyadenosine analogs, ¯udarabine desphosphate and cladribine, against four
human colon tumor cell lines. the human colon cell lines
tested and the antiproliferative activity of the drugs in
terms of the ic50 values are summarized in table 1. clf-araa showed potent antiproliferative activity against
the four human colon tumor cell lines tested, with a
mean ic50 of 0.26 lm ranging between 0.07 lm and
0.8 lm with a 72-h exposure. the activity was greater

optimal administration schedule for antitumor activity
we ®rst sought to determine the optimal administration
schedule for  xxxd1722xxx  before the precise evaluation of
its antitumor activity. the antitumor activity against
subcutaneously inoculated ht-29 human colon tumors
in nude mice was evaluated in three intraperitoneal administration schedules: single (administration on day 0),
twice-weekly (administration on days 0 and 3), and 5-day
daily (administration on days 0±4) (table 2, fig. 2). a
result was considered signi®cant when t/c was less than
50% and the p-value was less than 0.05. the daily administration schedule (fig. 2c) was evaluated at doses in
the range 25±100 mg/kg per day and was dose-dependently eective showing t/cmin of 48% and 30% at
50 mg/kg per day and 100 mg/kg per day, respectively.

the t/c value was less than 50% and the p-value from statistical

on the other hand, the single (fig. 2a) and the twiceweekly (fig. 2b) administration schedules showed no
signi®cant activity even at 250 mg/kg per day, the maximum dose tested at which no mice died. however, the
twice-weekly administration at 250 mg/kg per day
showed increased activity compared with the single administration, but the daily schedule showed a more potent eect when compared in terms of the total dose of
each schedule. the daily schedule at 50 mg/kg per day (a
total dose of 250 mg/kg) showed signi®cant activity
whereas the other schedule at the same total dose did not.
therefore, it was concluded that  xxxd1722xxx  showed a
schedule-dependent antitumor activity with an increased
therapeutic ecacy when administered daily. similar
results were also seen with the oral and intravenous administration schedules (data not shown), suggesting that
 xxxd1722xxx  might show time-dependent activity against
tumor cells. this is consistent with the results of kinetic
analysis of antiproliferative activity, which was analyzed
in terms of the relationship between drug concentration
and exposure time, reported by inaba et al. [9]
antitumor activity of  xxxd1722xxx  administered
by the oral and intravenous routes
we next investigated the antitumor activity of cl- xxxd2120xxx  administered orally and intravenously against the
ht-29 tumor xenograft model in a 5-day daily schedule
(table 3, fig. 3). the oral administration schedule was
evaluated at doses in the range 25±200 mg/kg per day.
two of ®ve mice had died by day 7 at 200 mg/kg per day
(table 3).  xxxd1722xxx  was signi®cantly eective in the
dose range 50±100 mg/kg per day, particularly showing
marked activity with a t/cmin of 8% at 100 mg/kg per
day. as shown in fig. 3a, 100 mg/kg per day of cl- xxxd2120xxx  showed a regressive growth curve by day 16. signi®cant body weight loss was not observed with any of
the doses tested compared with the body weight of each
group on day 0. on the other hand, the intravenous
administration schedule was evaluated at doses in the
range 25±100 mg/kg per day because ®ve of ®ve mice
died at 200 mg/kg per day in an independent experiment
(data not shown).  xxxd1722xxx  was also signi®cantly effective administered intravenously at doses in the range
50±100 mg/kg per day, but did not cause regression of
tumor volume (fig. 3b). slight body weight loss was
observed on day 4 of the last treatment at 100 mg/kg per
day, but it immediately recovered (fig. 3b). therefore,
oral administration showed superior activity to intravenous administration, particularly at 100 mg/kg per
day.
a dose of 200 mg/kg per day was not tolerated by
mice on both the oral and intravenous administration
schedules. therefore, the maximum tolerated dose
(mtd) of  xxxd1722xxx  administered orally might be almost the same as when administered intravenously. this
suggests that  xxxd1722xxx  could have excellent oral bioavailability in mice in our system.

volumes were measured twice weekly and studied for 22 days after
initial treatment (day 0)

antitumor activity of  xxxd1722xxx 
against human colon tumors
to investigate whether  xxxd1722xxx  shows antitumor activity against other human colon tumor xenograft
models, additional experiments with colon tumor xenografts widr, co-3 and colo-320dm were performed
using a 5-day daily oral administration schedule. as
shown in table 4,  xxxd1722xxx  showed signi®cantly superior antitumor activity with a t/cmin of less than
10% at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day, showing regressive
or cytostatic activity for all the colon tumor models
tested (fig. 4). interestingly, the colo-320dm tumor

we also investigated the antitumor activity of cl- xxxd2120xxx  against other xenografts including lung, breast and
stomach tumors (table 4).  xxxd1722xxx  showed the
greatest superior activity against the lx-1 tumor xenograft, as it did against colon tumors, of three lung tumor
xenografts tested. it also showed moderate activity
against mx-1 breast tumor xenograft. however, it
showed no activity against ns-8 stomach or the other

therapeutic ecacy in terms of frequency
of administration
it has been recently reported that drugs that can be activated by  xxxg611xxx  and are not inactivated
by deaminases would show interspecies dierences in
mtd between humans and mice [22]. the mtd of these
drugs, such as ¯udarabine phosphate and cladribine, in
humans is approximately 10- to 50-fold lower than in
mice [8, 14, 28]. therefore,we wondered whether cl- xxxd2120xxx  would show antitumor activity with a t/c of less

was administered in a 5-day daily oral administration schedule at
100 mg/kg per day (s control, d treated group) into nude mice
inoculated with a human colon tumor (a ht-29, b widr, c co-3,
d colo-320dm). tumor volumes were measured twice weekly
after initial treatment (day 0) and are represented as the mean

kg per day, h 12.5 mg/kg per day, n 25 mg/kg per day,  xxxd2777xxx  mg/
kg per day) or a 10-day daily (b + control, n 3.1 mg/kg per day, m
6.3 mg/kg per day, h 12.5 mg/kg per day, n 25 mg/kg per day, s
50 mg/kg per day) oral schedule to nude mice inoculated with widr
human colon tumors. tumor volumes were measured twice weekly
and are represented as the mean relative tumor volume (v/v0). the
mean tumor volume of each group on day 0 was 170  44 mm3

than 50% at much lower doses than the mtd in mice in
order to predict clinical ecacy. it is noteworthy that, as
shown in table 2, the mtd of  xxxd1722xxx  in three administration schedules appeared to be relatively constant
regardless of administration frequency. we expected
that a dose of 100 mg/kg per day might be tolerable in
mice particularly with more frequent administration.
the antitumor activity of  xxxd1722xxx  in a 10-day daily
oral administration schedule was investigated using the
widr human colon tumor xenograft model.  xxxd1722xxx 
was evaluated at doses in the range 3.1±100 mg/kg per
day in a 10-day daily administration schedule (fig. 5b).
one of three mice died receiving 100 mg/kg per day, a
dose that was tolerated by mice treated on a 5-day daily
schedule (table 5). however, the therapeutic ecacy
was increased because  xxxd1722xxx  showed potent antitumor activity even at 3.1 mg/kg per day, one-sixteenth
of 50 mg/kg per day, whereas it was eective at 12.5 mg/
kg per day, one-eighth of 100 mg/kg per day, in a 5-day
daily administration schedule. as shown in fig. 5b, clf-araa showed a regressive growth curve even at
12.5 mg/kg per day in a 10-day daily administration
schedule. these results suggest that the therapeutic ecacy of  xxxd1722xxx  might be increased by more frequent
administration.
eect of  xxxd1722xxx  on liver micrometastases
of colon tumor cells
we investigated the eect of  xxxd1722xxx  on liver micrometastases of colon tumors (fig. 6). the liver is frequently the ®rst and only site of dissemination of colon
cancer in clinical practice and it has been reported that
liver metastases develop in 90% of patients who die of

than 60% of which reach the liver by 5 min after intraspleenal injection [5], were injected into the spleen to
produce the model of liver micrometastases,. six days
after the intraspleenal injection,  xxxd1722xxx  was administered in a 5-day daily oral schedule at doses in the
range 25±100 mg/kg per day, and tumor foci in the liver
were scored after a further 3 weeks. the number of tumor foci formed in the untreated control group was
38  15 under our conditions and  xxxd1722xxx  decreased
the formation of tumor foci at doses in the range 50±
100 mg/kg per day in a dose-dependent manner. the

in a 5-day daily oral administration schedule. the liver micrometastis burden at 4 weeks after tumor injection was evaluated by
counting tumor foci of >2mm in diameter. statistical signi®cance
was determined by the steel test (*p < 0.05)

drug completely suppressed the formation of tumor foci
in the liver at a dose of 100 mg/kg per day.

discussion
 xxxd1722xxx  is a novel deoxyadenosine analog which is
activated by  xxxg611xxx  [3], without being inactivated by deaminases [15], in the same manner as ¯udarabine phosphate and cladribine [1, 2]. the drug shows potent
cytotoxicity against several leukemic cell lines including
those of human origin such as ccrf-cem and k562
[3, 15, 17], and is also eective against murine tumor
syngeneic models such as p388 leukemia, colon 36 and
mammary 16/c [27]. interestingly,  xxxd1722xxx  is curative
against both early and advanced stages of colon 36 tumors. therefore, we studied human colon tumors. cl- xxxd2120xxx  showed more potent antiproliferative activity than
¯udarabine desphosphate or cladribine against the human colon tumor cell lines tested and showed marked
antitumor activity with regressive or cytostatic activity
against all human colon tumor xenografts tested, but
was not eective against two lung tumors and a stomach
tumor.
in this regard, the level of deaminase in tumors
might, in part, play an important role because it has
been reported that an antimetabolite activated by  xxxg611xxx 
is eective against tumors with a high level of deaminase
[10].  xxxd1722xxx  is also included in such antimetabolites.
we have preliminary data that human colon tumor
xenografts such as ht- 29, widr and co-3 have relatively high deaminase activity compared with some tumor xenografts derived from other organs. it has also
been reported that many human colon cancer tissues
have high deaminase activity [10]. therefore, human
colon cancers may show high susceptibility to cl- xxxd2120xxx . however, there are marked dierences in the
enzyme activities of tumors [7, 23]. we also have preliminary data that the ns-8 tumor xenograft, which is
resistant to  xxxd1722xxx , has high deaminase activity.
therefore, this aspect requires further exploration.
drugs that suppress metastases show important effects on survival of patients. the liver is the ®rst and
only site of dissemination of colon cancer. at the time of
initial colorectal resection, 25% of patients have hepatic
metastases, and more than 50% of patients will eventually develop them during their disease. liver metastases develop in 90% of patients who die of colon cancer
[25].  xxxd1722xxx  showed potent activity against liver
micrometastases of colon tumors as well as against
subcutaneously inoculated tumors. therefore, cl- xxxd2120xxx  may be clinically useful against colon cancers. this
eect would be, in part, due to the ®rst pass to the liver
of drug administered orally.
 xxxd1722xxx  is active orally because it has the advantages of stability in acid solution and resistance to
phosphorolytic cleavage compared with other deoxyadenosine analogs [3, 15]. in fact,  xxxd1722xxx  showed
potent antitumor activity following oral administration

239

in our experiments. the antitumor activity at 100 mg/kg
per day in a 5-day daily oral administration schedule
was much greater than that at the same dose administered intravenously. susceptibility dierences might be
due to unknown mechanisms such as long retention of
the drug in mice.
it has been recently reported that drugs catalyzed by
 xxxg611xxx  show dierences in mtd between humans and
mice [22]. the mtd of these drugs in humans is approximately over tenfold lower than in mice [8, 14, 28].
therefore, these drugs would not be expected clinically
to show such potent activity in humans as in the mouse
model.  xxxd1722xxx  showed potent antitumor activity at a
broad of doses range in a 10-day daily oral administration schedule. its therapeutic eciency might be increased by more frequent administration. however, we
have no evidence on hematological toxicity, particularly
cumulative toxicity against bone marrow, resulting from
more frequent administration. therefore, we need to
examine this drug using in vitro and in vivo mouse
models and if possible, in vitro models using human
bone marrow cells.
preliminary experiments in a mouse model have indicated that  xxxd1722xxx  is more active against cll than
¯udarabine [3]. we have also observed that  xxxd1722xxx 
shows more potent antiproliferative activity against
leukemic cell lines than against carcinoma cell lines.
therefore, we are now investigating human tumors in
which  xxxd1722xxx  shows broader therapeutic ecacy.
