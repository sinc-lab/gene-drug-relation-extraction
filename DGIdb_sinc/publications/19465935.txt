abstract
erectile dysfunction (ed) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (dm). this study investigates the
relationship between ed and the downregulation of constitutive  xxxd2738xxx  synthase (cnos) in the corpus
cavernosum (cc) of diabetic rats. it also examines the effects of  xxxd3464xxx , a phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5)
inhibitor, on ed and cnos expression levels. after 16 weeks of daily oral treatment with  xxxd3464xxx  in diabetic rats,
the intracavernous pressure/mean arterial pressure (icp/map) ratio was recorded to measure erectile function,
and cnos expression was measured using reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr and immunoblots. although the icp/
map ratio and the expression levels of endothelial nos (enos) and  xxxg1577xxx  ( xxxg1577xxx ) in the cc were
markedly decreased in diabetic rats, long-term  xxxd3464xxx  treatment improved the erectile function and increased
cnos expression compared with diabetic controls. these findings suggest that ed in dm is closely related to
decreased cnos expression in the cc and that  xxxd3464xxx  has the ability to compensate for this pathological change
by modulating cnos expression.  xxxd3464xxx  also has an inhibitory role in cyclic  xxxd1067xxx  (cgmp)
degradation.

introduction

diabetes mellitus (dm) causes erectile dysfunction
(ed) through a variety of pathophysiological changes
affecting psychological function, central nervous system function, androgen secretion, peripheral nerve
activity, endothelial cell function and smooth muscle
contraction [1].

factor in the initiation of penile erection by inducing
smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum
(cc) [2]. as a neurotransmitter and vascular tone
regulator, the production of no is tightly regulated by
constitutive  xxxd2738xxx  synthases (cnoss), such as
 xxxg1577xxx  ( xxxg1577xxx ), in penile neurons innervating
the cc [3]. endothelial nos (enos) is active in penile
vascular endothelial cells and in trabecular meshwork
activated by blood flow-mediated shear stress [4, 5].
 xxxg1577xxx  and enos were expressed in normal rat
penile shaft at both the gene and the protein levels [6].
although the results are conflicting regarding the effects of experimentally induced dm on nos expression, some studies have reported a reduction in nos
activity in vitro and in the  xxxg1577xxx  isozyme content in

pde5 inhibitor and  xxxd2738xxx  synthase

the cc of diabetic animals [7-9]. there has also been a
report of greatly decreased corporal no concentration
in  xxxd3249xxx  (stz)-induced dm after stimulation
of the cavernous nerve in rats [10]. similarly, no production in the penis of diabetic rats by  xxxg1577xxx  and enos
after chemical diabetogenesis was markedly decreased,
and protein expression was correlated with no production [11]. among the three isoforms of nos, inducible
nos accounts for the response to inflammatory stimuli
in macrophages [12], although its role in ed is not fully
understood. otsuka long–evans tokushima fatty rats,
an established animal model of congenital dm [13],
exhibit lower protein expression levels of enos and
 xxxg1577xxx  in cc, but  xxxg1578xxx  expression has been
shown to be higher than that in controls [14]. on closer
inspection of the published data [15], cnos expression
is definitely altered to a great extent in rat models of
dm.
phosphodiesterase type 5 (pde5) inhibitors are
effective in ed associated with dm and in obesity by
inhibiting degradation of cgmp [16, 17]. however,
their effects on nos gene and protein expression levels have not been reported. therefore, this study was
designed to investigate whether chronic administration
of the pde5 inhibitor  xxxd3464xxx , a pyrazolopyrimidinone
derivative, is able to enhance erectile function by modulating cnos gene and protein expression levels as the
underlying mechanism.

materials and methods

2.1 induction of experimental diabetes in rats
this study was carried out in accordance with the
institutional ‘standard operating procedure for animal
care and experiments’ of dong-a pharmaceutical
company and the ‘guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals’ from the national institutes of
health (nih). eight-week-old sprague–dawley rats
were obtained from charles river (yokohama, japan)
and maintained under standard laboratory conditions.
the rats were given food and uv-sterilized tap water
ad libitum. dm was induced by an intravenous
injection of stz (sigma, st. louis, usa) dissolved in
sterilized saline (55 mg per 2 ml per kg body weight).
hyperglycaemic rats with blood glucose levels > 300 mg
per 100 ml were assigned to this study. the experimental
groups consisted of age-matched normal control (n = 20),
diabetic control (n = 20), and 5 and 20 mg kg−1  xxxd3464xxx 
treatment groups (n = 20, respectively). body weight and

blood glucose levels were measured every 2 weeks after
the induction of dm.
2.2 treatments
 xxxd3464xxx , a pde5 inhibitor developed by dong-a
pharmaceutical company (seoul, korea), is distinguished
by its superior pharmacokinetic profile and a low
incidence of adverse effects in humans.  xxxd3464xxx  was
dissolved in titrisol solution (citrate sodium hydroxide
buffer, ph 5.0) from merck (darmstadt, germany) and
orally administered daily to diabetic rats at doses of 5
or 20 mg kg−1 for 16 weeks. age-matched and diabetic
control rats were given vehicle only.
2.3 evaluation of erectile function
after 16 weeks of administration, five rats from
each group were anesthetized with ketamine and
xylazine, and the right carotid artery was exposed
and cannulated with a pe-50 tube filled with 50 iu
heparinized saline to monitor mean arterial pressure
(map). the penile crura were exposed through a
perineal–scrotal and prepuce incision by spreading
the overlying ischiocavernous muscle. a 26g needle
connected to the pe-50 tube was inserted into the
cc to measure the intracavernous pressure (icp) and
simultaneous penile erection. the lateral prostate
space was exposed through a lower midline abdominal
incision and the cavernous nerve was identified by
removing the thin, filmy, semitransparent fascia covering
the lateral prostatic space. the cavernous nerve, which
usually runs from the major pelvic ganglion on the
dorsolateral prostate surface, was then visualized for
the erectile response. electrostimulation was carried
out for 1 min using a bipolar stainless steel electrode
(unique medical, tokyo, japan) by hooking the
cavernous nerve 3–4 mm distal to the major pelvic
ganglion. monophasic rectangular pulses fixed at
5 ms, 3 v and 10 hz were delivered from an electric
stimulator (hse, march-hugstetten, germany) during
electrostimulation. map and icp were recorded using
a signal processor. this measurement was carried out
24 h after the last administration to eliminate the acute
effects of  xxxd3464xxx .
2.4 enos and  xxxg1577xxx  mrna expression levels in cc
freshly dissected ccs from 16-week-treated
rats were subjected to reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr
amplification for enos and  xxxg1577xxx  mrna. total
rna samples were isolated using trizol (invitrogen,

carlsbad, ca, usa) and quantified by the following
steps. the sequences of the specific pcr primers
w ere 5 ′ -ctgctgccccagatatcttc-3 ′ and
5 ′ -caggtactgcagtccctcct-3 ′ for enos
and 5 ′ -ccggctacacttctcctcac-3 ′ and 5 ′ cacgaagcaggggactacat-3′ for  xxxg1577xxx . isolated
rna samples were reverse-transcribed to first strand
cdna at 48ºc for 45 min, and rna/cdna hybrids
were denatured by 2-min incubation at 94ºc. pcr
amplification, including second strand cdna synthesis,
consisted of 35 cycles of denaturation (94ºc, 30 s),
template/primer annealing (enos: 54ºc,  xxxg1577xxx : 52ºc
for 1 min), and extension (68ºc, 2 min). all procedures
were carried out using the access rt-pcr system
(promega, madison, usa). one-percent agarose gel
electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining were
applied to verify the 230-bp pcr products of enos
and the 210-bp pcr products of  xxxg1577xxx . densitometric
analysis was carried out using the bio-profil system
and bio-1d image analysis software (vilber lourmat,
torcy, france). rt-pcr was carried out 24 h after
the last administration to eliminate the acute effects of
 xxxd3464xxx .
2.5 enos and  xxxg1577xxx  protein expression levels in cc
the protein expression levels of enos and  xxxg1577xxx 
were studied using the western blot technique. cavernosal tissue from each rat was minced and then placed
into lysis buffer for 10 min. the homogenates were
centrifuged at 16 000 × g for 20 min at 4ºc, and the
protein concentration in the supernatant was determined
by the bradford method. each sample was denatured
for 10 min at 95ºc in nupage lds sample buffer
(invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) and equal amounts
of protein and seeblue plus2 size marker (invitrogen)
were loaded for each sample. the loaded samples were
electrophoretically separated on 12% sds-page gels
at 200 v for 35 min and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (invitrogen) for 1.5 h. the membranes were

blocked with 5% skim milk on a shaker for 1 h. the
membranes were then treated with enos (140 kda)and  xxxg1577xxx  (155 kda)-specific monoclonal primary
antibodies (1:250 dilution, bd bioscience, san diego,
ca, usa) for 1.5 h at room temperature and washed
thrice with phosphate-buffered saline. an alkaline
phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary
antibody at a 1:2 000 dilution was applied for 1 h at
room temperature. specific bands for enos and  xxxg1577xxx 
proteins were visualized using the nbt/bcip (cygnus
technologies, southport, usa) substrate, and optical
density was measured with the bio-profil system
and bio-1d image analysis software (vilber lourmat,
torcy, france). immunoblotting was also carried out
24 h after the last administration of  xxxd3464xxx .
2.6 data analysis
all statistical analyses were carried out using sigmastat for windows (systat software, point richmond,
ca, usa). the analysis of variance test was used for
comparisons between experimental groups and between
each test group. all data are expressed as the mean ± sd.
data from each experiment were obtained from at least
5 animals. comparisons between the group mean values were carried out using kruskal–wallis anova
(analysis of variance) on ranks at a statistical significance level of p < 0.05.

results

3.1 body weight, blood glucose level and erectile
function
the body weights and blood glucose levels (table 1)
of the diabetic and  xxxd3464xxx -treated groups were significantly different from that of normal controls at 8 weeks
and at 16 weeks after the induction of dm (p < 0.05).
 xxxd3464xxx  treatment has no effect on the changes caused by
diabetogenesis. after completion of the 16-week treatment, erectile response was monitored to verify whether

long-term administration of  xxxd3464xxx  is able to maintain
erectile function in dm. in the diabetic group, the maximum icp/map ratio was the lowest (27.4% ± 17.0%)
among all of the experimental groups and showed a
significant difference with respect to the age-matched
normal group (66.0% ± 8.5%), as depicted in figure 1
(p < 0.05). with respect to  xxxd3464xxx  treatment, both 5 and
20 mg kg‑1 treatments had positive test results for erectile
response, although there was no statistical significance in
the low-dose group (39.4% ± 18.0%). a noticeable and
significant increase in erectile response was achieved
in the high-dose group (51.6% ± 9.8%) compared
with the diabetic controls (p < 0.05). the time-course
changes in icp/map ratio are illustrated in figure 1.
areas under the curve (aucs) (icp / map [%] s) from
0 to 180 s were markedly increased in the high-dose
group (4252.05 ± 792.83), and the low-dose treatment
produced a mild shift with respect to the diabetic control
(3 414.00 ± 927.44 vs. 2 661.00 ± 853.59, respectively).
the auc of the normal group was 4 989.30 ± 525.74.
3.2 enos and  xxxg1577xxx  mrna expression levels in cc
as an extension to the functional study,  xxxg1577xxx  and
enos mrna expression levels in cc were evaluated
by rt-pcr. figure 2 shows the representative bands
and the quantified band intensities corresponding to
 xxxg1577xxx  and enos mrna levels. there was a marked
downregulation of  xxxg1577xxx  mrna expression in the
cc of diabetic rats compared with the age-matched
normal group. although low-dose  xxxd3464xxx  treatment
restored  xxxg1577xxx  mrna expression, high-dose treatment

augmented this response, with significant differences
with respect to the diabetic and the age-matched control
groups (p < 0.05).
3.3 enos and  xxxg1577xxx  protein expression levels in cc
similar results were obtained for enos protein expression. in the diabetic control group, enos protein
expression was markedly downregulated, and  xxxd3464xxx 
ameliorated this change. a remarkable increase in the
high-dose group was in accordance with the outcomes
for  xxxg1577xxx . the expression levels of  xxxg1577xxx  and enos
proteins in cc were densitometrically quantified by
immunoblot band localization (figures 3 a, b). the
mean  xxxg1577xxx  band intensity (figure 3 c) in the diabetic
control group remained at a significantly lower level (a
20.1% reduction) relative to the age-matched normal
group (p < 0.05). both the low- and the high-dose
treatments of  xxxd3464xxx  led to noticeable increases of
16.5% and 40.4%, respectively. these increases were
statistically significant compared with the diabetic controls (p < 0.05). it was also obvious that  xxxg1577xxx  protein
expression in the high-dose treatment group was higher
than that in the normal group. the results for enos
protein expression were similar to those for  xxxg1577xxx  expression. dm was characterized by a significant 21.2%
reduction in enos expression compared with agematched normal animals (p < 0.05). low-dose  xxxd3464xxx 

treatment did not result in normal expression levels,
although the 27.6% increase found with high-dose
treatment was significantly higher than in the diabetic
controls (p < 0.05), and slightly higher than in the agematched normal animals.

discussion

recently, no production and signal transduction
in the molecular pathogenesis of ed in dm have been
highlighted. however, pde5 inhibitors have not been
investigated in terms of their effects on nos gene and
protein expression levels. therefore, this study was
conducted to examine whether long-term administration of a pde5 inhibitor,  xxxd3464xxx , could contribute to
the preservation of cnos gene and protein expression
levels in experimental dm.
before the molecular study, functional testing was
carried out to measure erectile function in rats. a total
of 5 or 20 mg kg−1  xxxd3464xxx  was administered for 16
weeks to diabetic rats semel in die. icp / map ratios
were then measured 24 h after the last dose of  xxxd3464xxx ,
which has a half-life of 3–4 h in rats. this was done
to eliminate any acute effects of  xxxd3464xxx  on erectile
function. meaningful results were obtained for erectile
function in the high-dose treatment group based on the
fact that two parameters of erectile function, the max-

icp/map ratio and auc, were markedly increased,
which implies that long-term administration of a pde5
inhibitor in dm improves the erectile function. this
also raises the possibility that these positive effects are
related to upregulation of cnos gene or protein expression levels on the basis of no production, because no
is a key factor in the erectile response.
in dm, several theories have been proposed to
explain the changes in no production and nos activity. in view of the mechanisms of dm-induced ed,
nos activity subsequent to the transport of l-arginine
into the cell is not enhanced by insulin, and the plasma
concentration and vascular content of l-arginine are
reduced in diabetic rats [18]. arginase is an enzyme
that competes for the nos substrate, l-arginine. the
inducible form of this enzyme,  xxxg189xxx , is overexpressed in cc of diabetic patients and downregulates
the production of no [19, 20]. dm also reduces the
levels of nadph (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate), an essential cofactor for nos, and increases the levels of calcium-elevating second messengers, such as diacylglycerol and protein kinase c, thus
increasing smooth muscle contractility. interestingly,
glucose-induced elevation of protein kinase c seems
to be mediated by oxidative stress in rabbit cc smooth
muscle cells [21]. furthermore, rho-kinase protein
expression is increased in diabetic corporal tissue, and
the rhoa/rho-kinase signalling pathway plays an important role in the reduction of no synthesis through
enos suppression [22, 23]. in the diabetic rat penile
crura, icp is markedly decreased, and the gene expression levels of apoptotic factors, such as bak and bax,
are increased [24]. another important factor is the
formation of reactive oxygen species in dm. reactive
oxygen species from non-enzymatic glycosylation and
increased nadph oxidase activity impair endothelial
function in erectile tissue and quench no. in turn, this
causes a reduction in the bioavailability of no and
peroxinitrite formation by nitrosative stress, which is
highly toxic and damaging to the erectile tissue [25-27].
whatever the mechanism, diabetic rats exhibited
reduced gene and protein expression levels of cnos in
cc, and chronic treatment with  xxxd3464xxx  induced an increase in expression, especially in the high-dose group,
where overexpression of the cnos gene was clearly
observable. these results correlated well with the functional study. therefore, it can be suggested that altered
cnos expression is, to some extent, responsible for diabetic ed, and chronic treatment with  xxxd3464xxx  prevents

or minimizes these pathophysiological changes. the
overexpression of the cnos gene does not cause concern, because the protein expression level only reached
the normal level. recently, pde5 inhibitors have
gained attention for their possible role in the alleviation
of male infertility [28]. there is substantial evidence
that long-term treatment with other pde5 inhibitors
has a positive effect on antioxidant capacity, relief of
symptoms, and restoration of erectile function in human
and animal studies. for instance, sildenafil reduces
malondialdehyde levels and potentiates the total antioxidant capacity of plasma in stz-induced diabetic rats
[29], induces symptomatic improvement in pulmonary
hypertension [30] and prevents myocyte hypertrophy
[31]. moreover, erectile function, protein expression
of phosphorylated enos and nos enzymatic activity
are improved in normal rats by sildenafil treatment [3234]. chronic treatment with tadalafil in patients with
increased cardiovascular risk improved brachial artery
flow-mediated dilation, and resulted in a net increase
in nitrite/nitrate levels and a decrease in the plasma  xxxg674xxx  level [35]. furthermore, earlier studies show
that chronic treatment with  xxxd3464xxx  does not alter blood
pressure [36], and our in-house general pharmacology
studies also show that chronic  xxxd3464xxx  treatment does
not affect blood pressure or heart rate (data not shown).
on the basis of the results of this study, along with
the findings of earlier reports, it is important to clarify
the role of chronic inhibition of pde5 and to explore
new therapeutic modalities besides ‘on-demand’ treatment. diabetic ed correlates with reduced cnos expression, activity and no bioavailability in cc through
a variety of mechanisms, including reduced substrates
for nos, increased intracellular protein kinase c levels,
oxidative and nitrosative stress, endothelial cell damage
and diabetic autonomic neuropathy, and rhoa/rhokinase signalling. thus, increased cnos expression
owing to chronic pde5 inhibition is of potential value
in the treatment of diabetic ed, although nos activity
and no bioavailability were not specifically tested in
this study. the results of the functional study indirectly
indicate that no response and chronic pde5 inhibition
increase nos activity and no bioavailability in dm.
in summary, chronic inhibition of pde5 with  xxxd3464xxx  is a useful therapeutic strategy to prevent the progression of diabetic ed by enhancing cnos gene and
protein expression levels in diabetic cc, although the
specific mechanism remains to be elucidated. these
results also suggest that new treatment modalities for
