we designed and synthesized two novel series of azapodophyllotoxin analogues as potential antivascular agents. a linker
was inserted between the trimethoxyphenyl ring e and the tetracyclic abcd moiety of the 4-aza-1,2-didehydropodophyllotoxins. in the first series, the linker enables free rotation between the two moieties; in the second series, conformational
restriction of the e nucleus was considered. we have identified
several new compounds with inhibitory activity toward tubulin

polymerization similar to that of ca-4 and colchicine, while displaying low cytotoxic activity against normal and/or cancer
cells. an aminologue and a methylenic analogue were shown
to disrupt endothelial cell cords on matrigel at subtoxic concentrations, and an original assay of drug washout allowed us
to demonstrate the rapid reversibility of this effect. these two
new analogues are promising leads for the development of
vascular-disrupting agents in the  xxxd2980xxx  series.

introduction
the recognition that tumor vasculature can be used as a specific target for cancer therapy has been a breakthrough for
cancer treatment.[1] indeed, tumor vasculature is needed to
provide oxygen and nutrients to tumor cells, and is also the
main route for metastatic spread. in addition, because a single
vessel can support the survival of millions of tumor cells, the
targeting of tumor vasculature is crucial for killing the maximum number of tumor cells.
the antivascular approach aims to selectively cause the collapse of newly formed capillaries by using small-molecule vascular-disrupting agents (vdas), as opposed to antiangiogenic
therapy, which aims to prevent the formation of new tumor
blood vessels from the pre-existing vasculature. the specificity
of vdas is mainly due to major differences between normal
and tumor vessels, as the latter are highly disorganized. tumor
vessels are fragile, have abnormal permeability and diameter,
and are characterized by unstable endothelial intercellular
junctions.[2]
existing small-molecular-weight vdas are predominantly tubulin-binding agents.[3] however, some derivatives, including
flavone acetic acid and asa404, belong to a second class that
acts through a pro-inflammatory pathway. microtubules are essential structural components of the cytoskeleton and are involved in several important cellular processes such as mitosis,
vesicular transport, cell signaling, and shape maintenance. microtubules are dynamic structures, formed of a- and b-tubulin
heterodimers.[4] historically, the search for tubulin-binding
agents has attracted much attention for the development of
anticancer drugs. anti-microtubule agents can be divided into
two classes: inhibitors of tubulin polymerization that bind to
either the colchicine site or the vinca alkaloid site, and inhibi-

tors of tubulin depolymerization that bind to the taxane site.[5]
early discovered vdas are active only at doses near their maximum tolerated dose (mtd). agents that disrupt the tumor vasculature at doses well below their mtd are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical investigations, including the phosphate prodrugs of  xxxd1744xxx  a-4 (fosbretabulin) and a-1
(oxi4503), ave8062, and abt-751, among others.[6] these compounds are used in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy
or radiotherapy.
although the mechanism of action of vdas has not been
fully elucidated, it involves a rapid cytoskeletal remodeling of
endothelial cells through interphase microtubule disruption,
leading to shutdown of tumor blood flow within 2–6 h posttreatment. simultaneous activation of the rhoa/rho signaling

podophyllin analogues for vascular disruption
pathway allows endothelial cells to adopt a rounded morphology and form actin stress fibers, promoting disruption of ve
cadherin junctions and membrane blebbing. these changes
enhance endothelial monolayer permeability and cause blood
leakage and vessel collapse, leading to blood flow shutdown
and central necrosis of the tumor.[7]
identification of microtubule-binding drugs with greater
therapeutic antivascular selectivity, relative to their cancer cell
cytotoxicity, is an important objective for the next generation
of vdas.[3a] in this paper, we present our investigation of a
series of nitrogen analogues of  xxxd2980xxx  (figure 1).

results suggest that  xxxd2980xxx  analogues may be of
value as potential new vdas.
we have synthesized aza-analogues of  xxxd2980xxx  (1)
as a new class of antimitotic agents, with 4-aza-2,3-didehydropodophyllotoxin s 26711 (3) and n-methyl analogue s 26390
(4) as the hit compounds for this cytotoxic series (figure 2).[14]

figure 1. structures of  xxxd2980xxx  and deoxypodophyllotoxin.

 xxxd2980xxx  (1), a naturally occurring cyclolignan isolated from  xxxd2980xxx  species, is a well-known cytotoxic derivative that acts as a potent anti-microtubule agent.[8] in spite of
potential uses as a medicinal drug, human trials with  xxxd2980xxx  were discontinued due to its systemic toxicity.[9]
over the last 20 years, extensive structural modifications of  xxxd2980xxx  have led to the synthesis of etoposide, a glycosylated epimer of 4’-demethylpodophyllotoxin, which is presently in clinical use for the treatment of small cell lung cancer,
testicular carcinoma, acute leukemia, and lymphoma, among
others. however, etoposide is a  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitor and,
therefore, has an entirely different mechanism of action than
that of the parent compound. many structural  xxxd2980xxx 
analogues have been described, although research in this area
has mainly focused on the development of new  xxxg2312xxx  inhibitors.[10]
 xxxd2980xxx  acts at the colchicine binding site of tubulin.[11] the binding mode of colchicine was recently confirmed
by an x-ray structure of a,b-tubulin complexed with damacolchicine.[12] colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx  bind to b-tubulin
at its interface with a-tubulin, with the trimethoxyphenyl nucleus hidden within the b-subunit.
vascular disruption properties reported for antitubulin
agents have surprisingly not been exploited to date in  xxxd2980xxx  analogue studies. recently, the antiangiogenic activity of deoxypodophyllotoxin (2) (figure 1), a naturally occurring analogue of 1 without a hydroxy group at the c4 position,
was reported.[13] compound 2 inhibits the tube-like formation
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) at non-cytotoxic concentrations. moreover, deoxypodophyllotoxin is several-fold more potent against huvec than against several cancer
cell lines (a549, sk-ov, sk-mel-2, hct15, and b16f10).[13] these

figure 2. design of carbon homologated analogues 5–10 and aminologue
11 as potential vdas.

from a chemical point of view, the 4-aza-2,3-didehydro analogues present the advantages of possessing only one chiral
center and a stable, unsaturated, lactone ring. indeed, under
physiological conditions, epimerization at c2 of the trans-fused
g-lactone of  xxxd2980xxx  leads to the thermodynamically
stable but inactive cis-epimer. we therefore aimed to design
and synthesize novel 4-azapodophyllotoxin analogues as potential selective antivascular agents that maintain tubulin affinity but exhibit lower cytotoxicity against normal and/or cancer
cells, in other words, compounds that are active as vdas at
subtoxic concentrations.
within the 4-aza-2,3-didehydropodophyllotoxin series,[14] several derivatives were found to exhibit low cytotoxicity and
high tubulin affinity, making them good candidates for antivascular purposes. taking into account these results and the sar
study in the  xxxd2980xxx  series,[10c] coupled with the x-ray
structure of the a,b-tubulin– xxxd2980xxx  complex,[12] we
designed new azapodophyllotoxins with the e ring farther
from the abcd tetracycle, with complete or partial conformational restriction of the e nucleus.
the aim of the present work was to study two new series of
azapodophyllotoxins. in the first series, the linker inserted between the e and abcd moieties enabled free rotation around
single bonds c9-x and x-c1’ (figure 2). modifications to these
carbon homologues involved bond length and degree of bond
saturation, resulting in homologues 5 and 6, ethynologue 7,
benzologue 8, and vinylogues 9 and 10. in the second series,
conformational restriction of the e nucleus was considered, resulting in aminologue 11,[15] in which the c9 hybridization is

sp2 and rotation is blocked by creation of an additional pseudocycle (hydrogen bond between the amino moiety and the
lactone carbonyl, figure 2). a majority of analogues 5–11 are
n-methylated for synthetic and stability purposes, as n-substitution of the 1,4-dihydroquinoline nucleus prevents aromatization. in the first study, the methylenedioxy moiety, the lactone,
and the three methoxy groups of the e ring were maintained
in order to compare biological results with parent compounds
3 and 4. the potential antivascular activity of the synthesized
compounds was assessed by several biological tests, including
in vitro cytotoxicity, a tubulin polymerization inhibition assay,
analysis of endothelial cell morphology, and a cord disruption/
reorganization assay.

subsequent oxidation by dess–martin periodinane. benzologue
8 was obtained in four steps from commercially available trimethoxyaniline 16. diazotation of 16, followed by substitution
with  xxxd2375xxx , yielded trimethoxyiodobenzene 17.[18]
carbaldehyde 19 was then synthesized by a palladium-catalyzed biaryl coupling between iodobenzene 17 and boronic
acid 18.[19]
vinylogue derivative 10 was used as a common precursor
for both analogues 6 and 7. application of our one-pot, three
component procedure to the preparation of vinylogues 9 and
10 resulted in poor yields, and subsequent isolation of pure
compounds was very difficult. to circumvent this hurdle, we
split this procedure into two distinct steps: condensation of trimethoxycinnamaldehyde 21 with tetronic acid 15, followed by
reaction of diene 22 with the aniline.
the preparation of 21 involved two-carbon homologation of
results and discussion
the 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde using either a wittig reacsynthesis
tion[20] or an aldolization-crotonization with the acetic acid
vinyl ester.[21] we were unable to reproduce the latter synthesis,
we previously reported an original three component one-pot
even under a variety of experimental conditions. we optimized
reaction for the synthesis of 4-aza-2,3-didehydropodophyllothe preparation of aldehyde 21 adopting the procedure detoxins.[16] the notable advantages of this method are mild conscribed for the 3,4-dimethoxy analogues,[22] that is, reaction of
ditions without activation, fast reaction times, and tolerance
the commercially available acid 20 with thionyl chloride, folfor structural diversity. therefore, we decided to use this reaclowed by reduction of the resulting acyl chloride by lialhtion for the preparation of the new carbon homologated ana(otbu)3 in dry thf. in a second step, three equivalents of 21
logues using the corresponding aldehydes. using this one-pot
were reacted with one equivalent of tetronic acid 15 in hydroprocedure, involving tetronic acid 15, n-methyl-3,4-methylenechloric acid, according to a procedure described for the unsubdioxyaniline (14), and either aldehyde 13 or 19, the monomestituted cinnamaldehyde.[23] benzylidene 22 was obtained as a
thylenic analogue 5 and benzologue 8 were synthesized in
mixture of stereoisomers and in only 10 % yield, likely due to
50 % and 97 % yields, respectively (scheme 1).

chiometric condensation between 15 and 21 under neutral
two-step sequence developed by nicolaou et al.[17] from comconditions afforded 22 in 69 % yield, but as a single stereoisomercially available trimethoxyphenylacetic acid 12: reduction
mer which was not further identified. further reaction of 22
in the presence of lialh4 to the corresponding alcohol, with
(as a mixture or as a single stereoisomer) and aniline
23 in ethanol at reflux led to vinylogue 9 in 24 %
yield. the z conformation was established by nmr
spectroscopy, in particular, by the 16 hz 3j coupling
constant between the two ethylenic hydrogens (d =
6.20 and 6.30 ppm). to avoid formation of the corresponding quinoline, the reaction was stopped immediately after disappearance of the starting materials
as determined by tlc. dihydroquinoline 9 was purified by recrystallization from a dichloromethane/
methanol mixture, due to aromatization of the compound during flash column chromatography on silica
gel or alumina.
for n-methylated analogue 10, the yield was enhanced to 50 % by treating aldehyde 22 with aniline
14 at reflux in dichloromethane instead of ethanol
(scheme 2). the two-carbon homologated analogue
6 was obtained in a very good yield by palladiumcatalyzed hydrogenation of the extracyclic double
bond of vinylogue 10 without any reduction of the
lactone double bond (scheme 2). this regioselectivity

double bond.
in regards to ethynologue 7, the general 4-azapodophyllotoxin synthetic route, either in one step or in two sequential
steps, was unsuccessful for its preparation from vinylogue 10.
attempts at direct deshydrogenation of 10 into 7 using manganese dioxide, selenium dioxide, or dichlorodicyanoquinone
as oxidizing agents failed. consequently, we elaborated an
original pathway involving an addition-elimination procedure
for the synthesis of ethynologue 7 (scheme 2). in the first step,
10 was combined with osmium tetroxide to give diol 24 without hydroxylation of the intracyclic double bond for the same
reason as mentioned above. an in situ, two-step procedure,
i.e., mesylation of diol 24 and subsequent addition of libr, resulted in a 60 % yield of compound 25 upon optimization of
the reaction conditions. finally, treatment of 25 with potassium
tert-butoxide in thf at room temperature afforded ethynologue 7 in  xxxd2051xxx  % yield. amino analogue 11 was synthesized
according to our previously reported procedure.[15] two structurally relevant synthetic intermediates of this process, quinoline 26[15] and imine 27[15] (figure 3), were also biologically evaluated.

in order to determine the vascular-disrupting potential of these novel azapodophyllotoxin analogues, we
first evaluated their inhibitory activity toward tubulin
polymerization. these inhibition of tubulin polymerization (itp) values are presented in table 1 and are
expressed as the ratio of the ic50 value of a given derivative over the ic50 value of colchicine. the inhibitory activities of  xxxd1744xxx  a-4 (ca-4) and s 26711
(3) are also presented for comparison purposes. as
expected, reference compounds ca-4 (itp = 0.72) and
3 (itp = 0.47) were both strong anti-microtubule
agents, with ic50 values lower than that of colchicine.
compounds 5–8, 10, and 27 were considered inactive for tubulin polymerization inhibition because
they presented itp values greater than 40. in the
carbon homologue series, only n-unsubstituted vinylogue 9 showed significant anti-microtubule activity (itp = 0.75). insertion of a double bond between
the tetraline moiety and the trimethoxyphenyl ring
of 3 is therefore possible, whereas introduction of
both vinylogation and n-methylation (10, itp > 40)
resulted in complete loss of anti-microtubule activity.
furthermore, the combination of both a spacer
group and n-methylation led to a complete loss in
itp activity, as shown for derivatives 5–8 and 10. in
contrast, with an amino spacer, n-methylation was
well tolerated as aminologue 11 (itp = 2.89) was
found to exhibit significant itp activity. collectively,
these results suggest that the tetracyclic n-substitution is not, in itself, detrimental to tubulin binding. in

figure 3. structures of quinoline 26 and imine 27.

this series, it is noteworthy that the presence of a hydrogen
bond between the amino spacer and the lactone carbonyl
seems to be critical for tubulin inhibition activity (e.g. aminologue 11 and quinoline 26, as compared with inactive imine
27).
recently, a common pharmacophore for colchicine site inhibitors has been proposed to explain the structure-inhibition
of tubulin assembly relationships.[24] six pharmacophoric features have been identified for  xxxd2980xxx  (1), such as two
hydrophobic centers (trimethoxyphenyl and methylenedioxy
groups), one planar group (phenyl nucleus from the tetracycle), two hydrogen bond acceptors (the lactonic c=o and

podophyllin analogues for vascular disruption
were also quite effective, leading to tube disruption
 xxxd1891xxx  mm. treatment with 10 at concentrations up to
20 mm did not modify endothelial cell tubular structure (figure 5 and supporting information). it is noteworthy that compounds 5 and 11 significantly disorganized huvec assembly at sub-cytotoxic doses in
b16 cells.
with regard to the reorganization of tube-like
structures 3 h after drug washout of unbound compound, a rapid network reconstruction was noted for
compounds 5 and 11 (figure 5). this particular reorganization effect was observed with the same intensity at higher concentrations (20 mm) for analogue 5,
whereas the amino analogue 11 was a very potent
disruptor  xxxd1891xxx  mm and, therefore, only partial reconstruction was observed after 3 h (see supporting information).  xxxd543xxx  also disrupted the cords at
a highly cytotoxic concentration (10 mm), and its
effect was not reversible after drug washout. this
suggests that 9 and 11 may exhibit different tubulin
binding kinetics which cause distinct vascular disruption activity. it has been shown that, unlike ca-4, colchicine and  xxxd2980xxx  can elicit their effects
on neovasculature at doses close to the maximum
tolerated dose.[29] the wider therapeutic window of

inhibition of tubulin polymerization assay. tubulin assembly in microtubules was evaluated using the fluorescent dye dapi (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)[33] in 96-well black plates and observed
using a victor plate reader as previously described by barron

s. giorgi-renault et al.

et al.[34] and bane et al.[35] the standard assay was performed as follows: wells were charged with tubulin (cytoskeleton, 97 % pure,
final concentration: 1 mg ml 1) in pme buffer (100 mm pipes,
1 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 2 mm egta) with 10 mm dapi and varying concentrations of compounds or colchicine as an internal control. after preincubation for 45 min at room temperature, 5 ml of 1 mm gtp was
added to each well to initiate tubulin polymerization, and the
plate was then transferred to the temperature-controlled victor
plate reader at 37 8c for an additional 2 h. fluorescence was read
at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 nm and 450 nm, respectively. percent inhibition was determined as follows:
[1 dfsample/dfcontrol]  100, where dfcontrol = fno inhibition fcomplete inhibition,
and dfsample = fsample fcomplete inhibition with colchicine. the ic50 for drug-induced inhibition of tubulin polymerization is the concentration of
drug at which the extent of polymerization inhibition is 50 % of
the maximum value as determined from the semi-logarithmic plot
of percent inhibition as a function of the drug concentration using
the nonlinear regression software sigmaplot (jandel scientific). the
results are presented as the inhibition of tubulin polymerization
(itp), which is the ratio of the ic50 of the compound of interest
over the ic50 of colchicine. in our experimental conditions, the
average ic50 for the itp of colchicine was 0.36 mm. because the intrinsic fluorescence of compounds could interfere with this assay,
fluorescence readings were routinely taken at the same concentrations as used in the tubulin polymerization assay.
cytotoxicity assay. murine b16 melanoma cells, murine fibroblasts
nih 3t3, and ea.hy 926 endothelial cells [originally obtained from
dr. cora-jean s. edgell and used with her permission][36] were
grown in dulbecco’s modified essential medium (dmem) containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 % fetal bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin
and 100 mg ml 1 streptomycin. the cells were maintained at 37 8c
in a humidified atmosphere containing 5 % co2. exponentially
growing cells were plated onto 96-well plates at 5 000 cells per
well in 200 ml dmem. after 24 h, the cells were exposed to the solvent alone (dmso) or to the compounds of interest at the indicated concentrations for an additional 48 h. viability was assessed
using the mtt (1-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-3,5-diphenyltetrazolium)
test, and absorbance was read at 562 nm in a microplate reader
(biokinetics reader, el340).[37] stock solutions were prepared in  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso) and kept at 4 8c in the dark. experiments
were run in triplicate and repeated three times. results are presented as the inhibitory concentrations for 50 % of cells (ic50) for a
48 h exposure time. the ic50 values were determined using graphpad prism software (graphpad software, inc., san diego, ca, usa).
endothelial cell morphology. to assess the effects of compounds on
the morphology of endothelial cells, exponentially growing
ea.hy 926 cells in dmem containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 % fetal
bovine serum, 100 u/ml penicillin, and 100 mg ml 1 streptomycin
were plated onto 96-well plates at 5  103 cells/100 ml per well.
24 h after plating, the medium was aspirated, and 100 ml of
medium containing the test compound was added to the wells
containing the cells (in triplicate) in 10-fold dilutions, and incubated for 2 h at 37 8c and 5 % co2 atmosphere. after the 2 h incubation period, representative central areas of each well were photographed at 360  magnification.  xxxd1744xxx  a-4 was included
in the experiments as a positive internal standard.
huvec tube disruption and reorganization assay. huvec (lonza,
verviers, belgium) was cultured in egm-2 supplemented with hegf,
hydrocortisone, gentamicin,  xxxd164xxx , vegf, hfgf-b, r3- xxxg1144xxx ,  xxxd228xxx , heparin (egm-2 bulletkit), and fetal bovine serum.
huvecs were used from the second to the fifth passages for the
experiments and the medium was changed every two days.

huvecs in 100 ml egm-2 (2  104 cells well 1) were plated in 96-well
plates on a thick layer of matrigel (becton dickinson; 75 ml well 1)
and incubated for 16 h at 37 8c in a 5 % co2 atmosphere to allow
the cells to form tube-like structures. test compounds were dissolved in dmso (less than 0.1 % in each preparation; 100 ml well 1)
at various concentrations and were added to the formed cords
and incubated for a 3 h period. each well was then carefully
washed with medium and incubated for an additional 3 h. the effects of compounds on capillary tube disruption and eventual reorganization was evaluated by light microscopy (40  magnification)
at three indicated times (0 h, 3 h after addition of compound, and
3 h after washout). experiments were done in triplicate.
dose–effect responses of ca-4 and four new azapodophyllotoxins
(5, 9, 10, and 11) on endothelial tube-like disruption/reorganization
are provided in the supporting information.
