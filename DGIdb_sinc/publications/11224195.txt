effect of serotonergic drugs on footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalization in adult male rats.  modulation of ultrasonic vocalization (20-30khz) emitted by adult rats under stressful conditions such as unavoidable foot-shock has been evaluated as a model of anxiety. the effects of 5-ht(1a) receptor agonists with different intrinsic activities and the role of other 5-ht(1) receptor subtypes, and of 5-ht(2) and 5-ht(3) receptors, in mediation of ultrasonic vocalization were studied, as were the effects of increasing serotonergic activity by administration of the 5-ht releaser fenfluramine or the 5-ht precursor 1-5 htp. the time spent vocalizing 1-6min after four increascapable (1.0ma) footshocks was recorded. drugs with affinity for 5-ht(1a) receptors (i.e. 8-ohdpat, flesinoxan, ipsapirone, buspirone, gepirone, nan-190) abolished the vocalization irrespective of their efficacy. the mixed 5-ht(1) receptor and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (-)- xxxd123xxx  and  xxxd2957xxx  inhibited foot-shock-induced ultrasonic vocalization, whereas (-)  xxxd2869xxx  was ineffective. the beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist metoprolol and the beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ici 118.551 were without effect. this suggests that (-)- xxxd123xxx  and  xxxd2957xxx  act as partial 5-ht(1) agonists in the test model. the non-selective 5-ht(1) receptor agonists eltoprazine, m-cpp and 5-meodmt and the 5-ht(2) receptor agonists do1 and  xxxd2527xxx  also abolished the vocalization, whereas the 5-ht(2) receptor antagonist ritanserin and the 5-ht(3) receptor antagonists ondansetron, ics 205-930 and zacopride were without effect. (-)- xxxd2869xxx  reversed 8-ohdpat-induced inhibition. ritanserin reversed doi-induced inhibition of ultrasonic vocalization, but not 8-ohdpat-induced inhibition. this suggests that there is no functional interaction between 5-ht(1a) and 5-ht(2) receptors in this model. fenfluramine and 1-5-htp dose-dependently inhibited footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalization. these findings indicate that the effect most likely is mediated by postsynaptic 5-ht receptors, although contribution by presynaptic 5-ht receptors cannot be excluded. in conclusion, this study indicates that 5-ht(1a) receptors and 5-ht(2) receptors are involved in mediation of ultrasonic vocalization.
