we have identified a gene encoding a  xxxg828xxx , the
human  xxxg828xxx , located on chromosome 9q22.1, that is
distinct from the recently reported rat  xxxg827xxx .  xxxg828xxx 
structurally resembles  xxxg827xxx  (35% identity), having
seven transmembrane domains and a large extracellular
region, but differs in having a longer carboxy-terminal tail.
 xxxg828xxx  is localized to the cell surface in transfected
cos cells, and negatively couples to adenylyl cyclase in
response to gaba, baclofen, and 3-aminopropyl(methyl)phosphinic acid in cho cells lacking  xxxg827xxx . baclofen action is inhibited by the gababr antagonist,
2-hydroxysaclofen. the human  xxxg828xxx  and  xxxg827xxx 
genes are differentially expressed in the nervous system,
with the greatest difference being detected in the striatum
in which  xxxg827xxx  but not  xxxg828xxx  mrna transcripts
are detected.  xxxg828xxx  and  xxxg827xxx  mrnas are also
coexpressed in various brain regions such as the purkinje
cell layer of the cerebellum. identification of a functional
homomeric  xxxg828xxx  coupled to adenylyl cyclase suggests that the complexity of gabab pharmacological data
is at least in part due to the presence of more than one
receptor and opens avenues for future research leading to
an understanding of metabotropic gaba receptor signal
transduction mechanisms.

introduction
the type a and b ␥- xxxd2177xxx  (gaba) receptors mediate most synaptic inhibition in the central
nervous system (rabow et al., 1995; bowery, 1989; 1993).
whereas gaba action at ionotropic type a receptors
initiates fast inhibition through an increase in the chloride ion conductance, metabotropic type b receptors

mediate slow inhibition by interacting with guaninenucleotide-binding (g) proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity, activate potassium channels, and inactivate voltage-dependent calcium channels. a wide range
of actions have been attributed to  xxxg828xxx 
stimulation such as: analgesia, catatonia, modulation of
gastric motility, reduction of memory consolidation and
retention, and suppression of panic attacks (bowery,
1989).
kaupmann et al. (1997) described the expression
cloning of  xxxg827xxx  with rat cortex and cerebellum
cdna libraries, using detection by binding of the
radiolabeled gabab antagonist, cgp64213.  xxxg827xxx 
is a seven transmembrane domain receptor with homology to the metabotropic glutamate receptors and couples
to adenylyl cyclase in transfected hek293 cells. two
variants differing only in their n-terminal extracellular
region were found, gababr1a and b. pharmacological
studies have suggested a heterogeneity in the gababr,
which could be due to more than one receptor (bowery,
1993; cunningham and enna, 1996). further support for
this notion comes from the incomplete correlation between the binding affinities of native gababr and
recombinant  xxxg827xxx  (kaupmann et al., 1997). a further level of functional complexity has been revealed by
the demonstration that  xxxg827xxx  does not localize to
the plasma membrane in some transfected cells (couve
et al., 1998). this suggests that  xxxg827xxx  requires
additional information, perhaps in the form of a trafficking factor or binding partner, to reach the cell surface.
a bioinfomatics-based approach was used to search
for homologs of the rat  xxxg827xxx . in addition to
identifying the human  xxxg827xxx , we have discovered
an additional gene that encodes the human  xxxg828xxx , a
seven  xxxg1608xxx  that negatively couples

results
identification of human  xxxg828xxx 
est sequences
to identify  xxxg828xxx  cdna sequences, we
performed a blast search of the genbank expressed
sequence tag (est) database. a human est cdna
encoding a polypeptide with 96% amino acid identity to
rat  xxxg827xxx  (kaupmann et al., 1997) was retrieved,
thereby establishing the existence of the human ortholog of the  xxxg827xxx  gene (genbank accession no.
x90542, fig. 1a). a second human est was identified
which encodes a polypeptide with 38% amino acid
identity to rat  xxxg827xxx , encoding part of a new
 xxxg828xxx ,  xxxg828xxx  (t07621, fig. 1a). an alignment of the predicted amino acids of human  xxxg828xxx 
with human and rat  xxxg827xxx  and the human metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglur) indicates that
 xxxg828xxx  is more closely related to the human and rat
 xxxg827xxx  than the mglur 1–8 (fig. 1a).

isolation of a cdna encoding the human  xxxg828xxx 
primers were designed to screen fetal and adult
human brain cdna libraries, based on the partial
sequence of  xxxg828xxx  represented by the est cdna.
sixty-four positive cdna clones were isolated and a
subset sequenced. the complete amino acid sequence of
the  xxxg828xxx  (941 amino acids) was deduced from an
adult human brain cdna clone, d3. alignment of the
amino acid sequences of human  xxxg828xxx  and rat
gababr1b (kaupmann et al., 1997) indicates that these
polypeptides have 45% sequence similarity and 35%
identity (fig. 1b). gababr1a and gababr1b differ in
the n-terminal region and are otherwise identical (kaupmann et al., 1997).  xxxg828xxx  has a short n-terminal, like
gababr1b and not like the 147 residues unique to
gababr1a. hydropathy analysis of  xxxg828xxx  reveals a
hydrophobic n-terminus that is consistent with a signal
sequence and seven hydrophobic regions that are presumed to be transmembrane domains (tm1–tm7;
figs. 1b and 1c). the large n-terminal extracellular
region of  xxxg828xxx  resembles  xxxg827xxx  and the
mglurs but is unlike other g protein coupled receptors
(kaupmann et al., 1997).  xxxg828xxx  has an additional 80

181
amino acids in the carboxy terminal tail when compared
with  xxxg827xxx . this large c-terminal region may be
important for signaling or localization functions of
 xxxg828xxx .

cell surface localization of  xxxg828xxx  in cos cells
the mature  xxxg828xxx  protein has a calculated relative molecular mass of 102,000 (mr 102k) and five
potential extracellular n-glycosylation sites. when expressed in cos cells an epitope-tagged  xxxg828xxx  polypeptide has an apparent mr of 130k that is likely to be
glycosylated  xxxg828xxx  (fig. 2a, lane 2). gababr1a has
been reported to be retained intracellularly and fails to
reach the plasma membrane in heterologously expressing cells such as cos cells (couve et al., 1998). using two
approaches, we have demonstrated that the flagtagged  xxxg828xxx  is localized to the plasma membrane
in transfected cos cells. first, we demonstrated cell
surface biotin-labeling of  xxxg828xxx . intact cells were
labeled with biotin, and after termination of the reaction, solublized extracts were prepared for precipitation
with anti-flag agarose. by western blotting with
peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, we demonstrated
that the 130k mr  xxxg828xxx  was biotin-labeled consistent with its presence on the cell surface (fig. 2b, lane 2).
analysis of duplicate samples without reduction by
2- xxxd26xxx  revealed an approximately 260k mr
species (fig. 2b, lane 4). this may represent a homodimer of  xxxg828xxx . second, we performed immunocytochemical staining. the  xxxg828xxx  expressing cells
show a pattern of cell surface staining (fig. 2c). this
conclusion is reinforced by comparison with the cell
surface staining of membrane-bound kit ligand (steel
factor) (fig. 2d) and the intracellular staining of a
soluble form of kit ligand (fig. 2e) detected by a kit–fc
fusion protein (langer-safer et al., 1997).

we examined the  xxxg828xxx -transfected cho cell line
for possible expression of  xxxg827xxx  to determine
whether the selection process induced expression of
hamster  xxxg827xxx . using a polyclonal antiserum raised
against a c-terminal peptide of rat  xxxg827xxx , protein of
the expected mr (kaupmann et al., 1997) is immunoprecipitated from adult rat cerebellum, adult hamster
cerebellum, and embryonic rat cortical cultures, but
not from cho cell cultures stably transfected with
 xxxg828xxx  (fig. 3b). therefore  xxxg827xxx  protein is
undetectable in the cho cell line stably transfected with
 xxxg828xxx . these results support the conclusion that

 xxxg828xxx  can couple to adenylyl cyclase in the absence
of  xxxg827xxx .

expression of human  xxxg827xxx  and  xxxg828xxx 
the expression of the human  xxxg827xxx  and  xxxg828xxx 
transcripts in normal human tissues was examined by
northern blot hybridization analysis of poly(a)⫹ rna.
the probes used to detect  xxxg828xxx  and  xxxg827xxx 
transcripts in the hybridization correspond to the region
encoding the c-terminus. a specific hybridizing species
of 6.1 kb was found in human brain for the human
 xxxg828xxx  and a 4.4-kb species was detected for the
human  xxxg827xxx  (fig. 4a, lane 2).  xxxg828xxx  and
 xxxg827xxx  transcripts were detected in the human cerebral cortex, frontal lobe, occipital pole, temporal lobe,
cerebellum, medulla, amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and thalamus (fig. 4).  xxxg828xxx  transcripts
appear more prevalent than  xxxg827xxx  in the amygdala,
whereas the  xxxg827xxx  transcripts are more abundant in
the putamen and caudate nucleus (fig. 4b, lane 8, and

in situ hybridization of  xxxg828xxx  transcripts in the
adult rat brain and retina
we used in situ hybridization to examine the regions
of the rat brain in which both  xxxg827xxx  and  xxxg828xxx 
transcripts were detected by northern analysis. a rat
 xxxg828xxx  probe was used which was generated by
degenerate pcr with  xxxg828xxx  primers, as described
under experimental methods. in the cerebellum,
 xxxg828xxx  transcripts were detected in purkinje cells

(fig. 5a).  xxxg827xxx  has also been reported to be
expressed in this cell type (kaupmann et al., 1997),
suggesting that both gabab receptors may be coexpressed.  xxxg828xxx  expression was detected in the
ganglion cell layer in the retina (figs. 5b and 5c) in
agreement with previous studies that detected gabab
receptor function in the retina (slaughter and pan, 1992).

chromosomal localization of the human  xxxg828xxx

sequences. one of the pac clones was used to determine the chromosomal localization of the  xxxg828xxx 
gene using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish).
the  xxxg828xxx  probe specifically labeled 9q22.1 (fig. 6).
the genetic disorder hereditary sensory neuropathy
type 1 is located at 9q22.1–9q22.3 (nicholson et al., 1997),
indicating that  xxxg828xxx  is a candidate gene for this
neurological disease. the  xxxg827xxx  gene was isolated
in a transcription map of the hla class i region on a
yac clone that places the human  xxxg827xxx  gene at
chromosome 6p21.3 (grifa et al., 1998). the human
gababr genes are located on different chromosomes,
which is of interest from an evolutionary perspective.

the metabotropic  xxxg828xxx  is known to subserve a number of important neurophysiological functions in the nervous system such as mediating postsynaptic inhibition by an increase in potassium conductance
and presynaptic inhibition by decreasing calcium influx
(misgeld et al., 1995). pharmacological evidence suggests the presence of at least four different subtypes of
gabab receptors that are differentially distributed in
the nervous system (bonanno and raiteri, 1993a). moreover, the  xxxg828xxx  is believed to couple to
multiple effector systems in vivo.  xxxg827xxx  was recently
isolated (kaupmann et al., 1997), but closely related
receptors could not be found (malitschek et al., 1998).
here we report the identification of a seven transmembrane metabotropic receptor that shows homology to
 xxxg827xxx , is expressed on the cell surface, and couples
negatively to adenylyl cyclase in the absence of
 xxxg827xxx , indicating the existence of a novel gabab
receptor. the isolation and functional characterization
of  xxxg828xxx  demonstrates that the diversity of gabab
receptor function reflects, at least in part, multiple
gabab receptors rather than a single receptor that is
coupled to multiple types of g proteins.
the  xxxg827xxx  receptor was cloned by virtue of its
binding to the new high affinity antagonists, cgp64213
and cgp71872 (kaupmann et al., 1997), but no closely
related subtypes of gabab receptors were detected
using the high affinity antagonist cgp71872, in a developmental study of the rat brain (malitschek et al., 1998).
the authors conclude that presumptive subtypes are of
low abundance, restricted distribution, or may not bind
cgp71872. our results indicate that  xxxg828xxx  mrna is
of comparable abundance and distribution as  xxxg827xxx .
there are two likely explanations for this apparent

discrepancy. cgp71872 may not bind to  xxxg828xxx  and
may be selective for  xxxg827xxx . alternatively, the level
of  xxxg828xxx  protein may be limited by translational
regulation. we favor the former hypothesis as a novel
pharmacological profile for  xxxg828xxx  is consistent with
the data suggesting multiple subtypes of gabab receptors (bonanno and raiteri, 1993a).

 xxxg828xxx  has structural features, a pattern of expression and plasma membrane targeting that distinguish it
from  xxxg827xxx , suggesting a different role for gabab
receptor subtypes in the nervous system. in situ hybridization and northern analysis show overlapping but
distinct expression patterns of  xxxg828xxx  and  xxxg827xxx 
in the nervous system. in particular,  xxxg828xxx  tran-

scripts are undetectable in the human striatum, whereas
 xxxg827xxx  transcripts are detected in both the human
caudate nucleus and putamen.  xxxg828xxx  mrna is
detected in the retina ganglion cell layer and, therefore,
 xxxg828xxx  may represent one of the two types of gabab
receptors that have been detected in retinal ganglion
cells (zhang et al., 1997).
a large body of data on the pharmacology of gabab
receptors generated over the last two decades suggests
that multiple gabab receptors exist with different
agonist and antagonist properties. for example, pharmacological evidence suggests that multiple gabab receptors sensitive to baclofen exist in nervous tissue (bowery, 1993; cunningham and enna, 1996; bowery and
brown, 1997). additionally, a baclofen insensitive gabab
response has been described in the spinal cord (bonanno
and raiteri, 1993b). we have shown that baclofen acts as
an agonist at the human  xxxg828xxx , which, in this
respect, resembles the rat  xxxg827xxx  a and b (kaupmann
et al., 1997). it is therefore assumed that neither  xxxg828xxx 
nor  xxxg827xxx  is the baclofen insensitive autoreceptor of
the spinal cord (bonanno and raiteri, 1993b), suggesting
that one or more gababr genes remain to be discovered.
the surface localization of  xxxg828xxx  is evidenced by
surface biotin labeling, immunocytochemical staining
with transiently transfected cos cells, and the demonstration of  xxxg828xxx  signaling in intact stably transfected cho cells in response to agonists. in contrast,
gababr1a fails to reach the cell surface in cos cells
(couve et al., 1998). this difference could be explained
by a requirement of  xxxg827xxx  and not  xxxg828xxx  for a
trafficking factor, such as has been described for two
other seven transmembrane receptors (mclatchie et al.,
1998; dwyer et al., 1998). the c-terminal tail of  xxxg828xxx 
is 80 amino acids longer than that of the  xxxg827xxx , and
this variation between the receptors may underlie the
observed differences in cellular localization. it is tempting to speculate that differential targeting between the
gababrs may regulate  xxxg828xxx  signaling, and
this hypothesis merits further study, particularly with
regard to preferential localization in presynaptic, postsynaptic, or extrasynaptic membranes.
whereas  xxxg827xxx  can be immunoprecipitated from
adult rat cerebellum, adult hamster cerebellum, and
cultured embryonic rat cortical neurons, it is absent
from the stably transfected hamster cell line (cho cells)
that contains the  xxxg828xxx  protein used in our functional studies. this demonstrates that  xxxg828xxx  can
form a functional adenylyl cyclase coupled receptor
without the need for  xxxg827xxx .
while our manuscript was under review, kuner et al.

martin, russek, and farb

(1999) also reported that  xxxg828xxx  alone negatively
couples to adenylyl cyclase in transiently transfected
hek293 cells, whereas white et al. (1998) reported that
 xxxg828xxx  does not couple to adenylyl cyclase in transiently transfected hek293t cells. it remains unclear
why our results are in agreement with those of kuner et
al., but not those of white et al. nevertheless, there are
several likely possibilities. first, we selected for a stably
transfected cell line expressing a high level of  xxxg828xxx 
by using methotrexate to co-amplify  xxxg631xxx  on a dicistronic transcriptional unit with  xxxg828xxx .
this presumably yields a cell population with more
uniform levels of  xxxg828xxx  expression, making it easier
to measure an effect of baclofen on total cellular adenylyl cyclase activity than when using transiently
transfected cell lines. another potential explanation is
that the cell lines used for transfection may not contain
the necessary level of the appropriate g protein required
for negative coupling to adenylyl cyclase in vivo. moreover, differences in the levels of g protein expression
between different cell lines could result in differences in
coupling.
we conclude that  xxxg828xxx  has the potential to
function without  xxxg827xxx  in coupling to adenylyl
cyclase. our result that agonist-induced inhibition of
adenylyl cyclase activity is antagonized by 2-hydroxysaclofen when taken together with the result that
 xxxg828xxx  is resistant to inhibition by cgp54626a (kaupmann et al., 1998) suggests that  xxxg828xxx  may be
distinguished pharmacologically. inwardly rectifying
potassium channels (kir3) display larger aggregate currents when coexpressed with  xxxg827xxx  and  xxxg828xxx ,
indicating that heteromeric assembly of gabab receptors is required for maximal activity (jones et al., 1998;
white et al., 1998; kaupmann et al., 1998; kuner et al.,
1999). the existence of multiple gabab receptors with
different agonist and antagonist properties is consistent
with a model in which either homomeric or heteromeric
gabab receptors may couple to different cellular signal
transduction systems through different effectors.

experimental methods
isolation of the  xxxg828xxx  cdna
the primers h02 (58 caagaaccggaatcagaagc
38) and a11 (58 tgccagcagatcaggataca 38) were
used to screen human superscript cdna libraries (life
technologies, md) by pcr for the presence of  xxxg828xxx 

189

human gabab receptors

cdna clones. two of the positive human superscript
cdna libraries, fetal and adult brain, were screened
using the genetrapper cdna-positive selection system
(life technologies, md). the cdna clones isolated from
the adult and fetal brain library are in the vectors
pcmv · sport and pcmv · sport2, respectively. the
dna sequence of the human adult brain cdna clone
d3 was determined on both strands using an applied
biosystems 3773a dna sequencer (foster city, ca).
the sequence was compiled using the program sequencher (gene codes corporation, mi). other computer programs for sequence analysis were from the
wisconsin package, version 9.1, genetics computer
group (http://www. xxxg873xxx .com; madison, wi).

heterologous expression of  xxxg828xxx 
the human  xxxg828xxx  cdna (clone d3) was inserted
on a sali/xbai fragment into the sali and xbai sites of
the ped expression vector (kaufman et al., 1991), to
generate ped-d3. this construct places the expression
of the cdna under the control of the adenovirus major
late promoter and sv40 enhancer and in a transcription
unit that includes a wild-type  xxxg631xxx 
(dhfr) selectable marker gene. after digestion with
clai that linearizes the plasmid, the dna construct was
transfected into dhfr⫺ chinese hamster ovary (cho)
cells, and selected for dhfr expression in ␣ medium
with 10% (w/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 2 mm
l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin (kaufmann,
1990a). after three passages of the stably transfected
cells, they were further selected in the same medium
supplemented with 5 nm methotrexate. the resulting
cho cells were used for functional studies of the
 xxxg828xxx .
to construct a flag-epitope tagged form of
 xxxg828xxx , the sense primer (58 tac agc atg gag
ccg gac cc 38) and antisense primer (58  xxxg873xxx  aat
tct tac ttg tca tcg tcg tcc ttg tag tcc agg
ccc gag acc atg act c 38) were used to amplify by
pcr the c-terminal region of  xxxg828xxx  from the d3
cdna, which introduces the eight amino acid residue
flag peptide, dykddddk before the stop codon. the
resulting pcr fragment was digested with ecorv, which
cuts internally in the pcr fragment, and ecori, which
cuts at the 38 end, and used to replace the ecorv and
ecori fragment of ped-d3. the amplified region in the
resulting ped-d3-flag construct was sequenced to
ensure that no pcr errors had been introduced. cos
cells were transfected with deae-dextran, as described
(kaufman, 1990b).

immunocytochemistry and cell surface
biotin labeling
for immunocytochemical analysis, monolayers of
transfected cos cells were washed in pbs and permeabilized by treatment with methanol. the  xxxg828xxx -flag
was detected with anti-flag-biotin followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase. as controls, the wildtype, transmembrane form of kit ligand (steel factor)
was used for surface staining, and an engineered soluble
form of kit ligand (steel factor) that does not localize on
the cell surface, but is secreted into the medium and can
be detected in the secretory pathway, was used for
intracellular staining. kit ligand was detected with the
extracellular region of the kit receptor fused to human
fc, followed by anti-fc-alkaline phosphatase, as described (langer-safer et al., 1997). the kit materials were
kindly provided by dr. c. r. wood (genetics institute).
alkaline phosphatase was detected with nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-1-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate.
for cell surface labeling, cos cells were washed twice
in ice-cold 40 mm sodium bicarbonate, ph 8.6, 150 mm
 xxxd3213xxx  (bn buffer), followed by incubation
with the biotinylation reagent from the amersham
biotinylation kit (amersham, arlington heights, il) in
bn buffer. after 30 min at 4°c, the reaction was
quenched by addition of tris–hcl, ph 8.0, to a final
concentration of 25 mm. cell extracts were prepared in
ice-cold 1% (v/v) nonidet p-40, 0.1% (w/v) sds, 10%
(v/v) glycerol, 50 mm tris–hcl, ph 8.0, 150 mm
 xxxd3213xxx  with protease inhibitors, and precipitated with anti-flag agarose. after western blotting
with anti-flag biom2, labeled polypeptides were detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and
enhanced chemiluminescence (amersham).
 xxxg827xxx  was immunoprecipitated using a guinea
pig polyclonal antisera raised against the synthetic peptide pseppdrlscdgsrvhllyk from rat
 xxxg827xxx  (ab1531, chemicon, temecula, ca) and protein a–sepharose (zymed, south san francisco, ca).
 xxxg827xxx  was detected by western blotting with the
guinea pig polyclonal  xxxg827xxx  antisera. the polypeptides were detected with protein a–horseradish peroxidase (zymed, south san francisco, ca) and enhanced
chemiluminescence (amersham).

ligands and camp assay
 xxxd210xxx , 3-aminopropyl(methyl)phosphinic acid
(skf 97541, cgp35024), and 2-oh-saclofen were purchased from tocris (ballwin, mo). ␥- xxxd2177xxx 
(gaba) was purchased from rbi (natick, ma). monolayers of cho cells in 10-cm plates were washed twice

190
in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and a single cell
suspension was prepared by treatment with 20 mm
ethylene glycol-bis (2-aminoethylether) n, n, n8, n8tetracetic acid (egta) in pbs. the cells were washed
twice in krebs– xxxd3449xxx  (20 mm tris–hcl, ph 7.4, 118
mm  xxxd3213xxx , 5.6 mm glucose, 1.2 mm potassium phosphate, 1.2 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 4.7 mm
 xxxd2988xxx , 1.8 mm calcium chloride), containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-xanthine ( xxxd2388xxx ), and
then incubated at 37°c for 20 min. the suspended cells
were incubated at 37°c with 20 µm  xxxd1742xxx  and test
agents for 20 min. the cells were collected by centrifugation, lysed, and assayed for camp using the biotrak
enzyme immunoassay system purchased from amersham (arlington heights, il).

martin, russek, and farb

mm edta, 1 mg/ml denatured salmon testes dna, at
65°c. the blots were washed in 2⫻ ssc, 0.1% (w/v) sds
at 23°c for 30 min, followed by 0.2⫻ ssc, 0.1% (w/v)
sds at 60°c for 30 min, and exposed to kodak biomax
mr film (rochester, ny) with two intensifying screens
at ⫺80°c. in situ hybridization was carried out essentially as described by martin et al. (1995) with a 35slabeled rat  xxxg828xxx  antisense probe. the rat  xxxg828xxx 
probe was generated using degenerate pcr based on
the human  xxxg828xxx  sequence. the resulting rat 459-bp
sequence is 88.7% identical to human  xxxg828xxx , encoding an identical predicted amino acid sequence
(af112975).

acknowledgments
isolation of  xxxg828xxx  human p1 artificial
chromosome (pac) clones and chromosomal
mapping by fluorescence in situ hybridization
two human pac clones, pac 16946 and pac 16947,
were isolated in a pcr screen of a human genomic
library constructed in the pad10sacbii pac vector
using the primers 2803 (58 gcagccagagccgacagtgt 38) and 2818 (58 agaacacatccagcgtcgg 38) (ioannou et al., 1994). the identity of the
 xxxg828xxx  genomic clones was confirmed by nucleotide
sequencing using primers specific for the d3 cdna.
dna from pac 16946 was labeled with digoxigenin
dutp (boehringer-mannheim, il) by nick translation.
the probe was hybridized to human metaphase chromosomes from phytohemagglutin-stimulated peripheral
blood lymphocytes as described by russek and farb
(1995). hybridization was detected by incubation with
fluorescein-conjugated anti-digoxigenin fab fragments
(boehringer-mannheim, il) and counter stained with 48,
6- xxxd2875xxx -28-phenylindole dihydrochloride (dapi).
a total of 80 metaphase cells was analyzed with 64
exhibiting specific labeling. the location of the  xxxg828xxx 
gene was determined from the measurement of 10
specifically labeled chromosomes.

northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization
of rat tissue sections
the northern blots were purchased from clontech
(palo alto, ca) and were hybridized sequentially to
probes for human  xxxg828xxx , human  xxxg827xxx , and
human ␤-actin (clontech, palo alto, ca). the dna was
labeled using the random primed dna labeling kit
(boehringer-mannheim, il). hybridizations were carried out in 6⫻ ssc, 5⫻ denhardt’s, 0.5% (w/v) sds, 10
