reduced satiating effect of d-fenfluramine in serotonin
 xxxg1115xxx  mutant mice

received: 28 september 1998 / final version: 17 november 1998

abstract rationale: d-fenfluramine stimulates the release of serotonin (5-ht) and is a potent inhibitor of the
re-uptake of 5-ht into nerve terminals. administration
of d-fenfluramine suppresses food intake in both animals
and humans. objective: we have investigated the role of
the  xxxg1115xxx  in mediating the effect of d-fenfluramine on mouse food intake and the behavioural satiety
sequence. methods: mutant mice lacking serotonin 5ht2c receptors and wild-type animals were habituated to
a daily presentation of wet mash. animals were non-deprived and received d-fenfluramine (3–30 mg/kg) 30 min
prior to being assessed for the presence of stereotypy and
presented with wet mash. the behaviour of animals was
observed for the subsequent 40 min and food intake was
recorded. results: d-fenfluramine dose-dependently inhibited the consumption of a palatable wet mash by the
mice. d-fenfluramine (3 mg/kg) significantly reduced
the amount of wet mash consumed by wild-type mice
and induced a temporal advance in the behavioural satiety sequence consistent with an enhancement of satiety.
mutant mice were less sensitive to the satiating effects of
3 mg/kg d-fenfluramine. hence, this dose of d-fenfluramine had a reduced effect on both food consumption
and the behavioural satiety sequence in the 5-ht2c mutant mice. in contrast, mutant mice showed an increased
sensitivity to the stereotypy induced by high doses of dfenfluramine (10, 30 mg/kg) compared to that of wildtype littermates. conclusion: these data demonstrate a
role for the  xxxg1115xxx  in mediating d-fenfluramine-induced satiety.

introduction
the serotonergic system has been extensively implicated
in the control of feeding behaviour (for reviews see
blundell 1977; dourish 1995); indeed, the recently withdrawn appetite suppressant d-fenfluramine stimulates the
release of 5-ht and is a potent inhibitor of the re-uptake
of 5-ht into nerve terminals (garattini et al. 1986). at
least 14 serotonin receptor subtypes have been described
(boess and martin 1994; martin and humphrey 1994)
and studies using non-selective antagonists at these receptors have suggested that the 5-ht1b and  xxxg1115xxx  subtypes are of particular importance in mediating
d-fenfluramine-induced hypophagia (neill and cooper
1989; grignaschi and samanin 1992; vickers et al.
1996). however, due to the absence of selective ligands,
the precise role of serotonin receptor subtypes in mediating d-fenfluramine-induced hypophagia has remained
uncertain.
recently, the development of mice lacking functional
5-ht2c receptors has provided a complementary approach (tecott et al. 1995). it has been reported previously that 5-ht2c mutant mice are overweight compared
to wild-type animals and that this increase in body
weight is likely to be due to enhanced food intake
(tecott et al. 1995). in addition, despite there being no
obvious evidence of anatomical or functional abnormalities in the cns of these animals, the mutants display an
enhanced seizure susceptibility (tecott et al. 1995;
brennan et al. 1997). we have now used the 5-ht2c
knockout mouse to examine the importance of the 5-ht2c
receptor in mediating d-fenfluramine-induced hypophagia.
when allowed to feed to satiety, rats exhibit a characteristic sequence of behaviours. thus, the cessation of
feeding is superseded by a brief period of active behaviours including locomotion, rearing and grooming which
is in turn followed by a longer period of rest and/or sleep

310

(antin et al. 1975). this behavioural sequence is sensitive to manipulations that affect ingestive behaviour and
has been used to discriminate between satiety-like factors and non-specific reductions in feeding. for example,
pre-feeding or administration of compounds such as dfenfluramine lead to a temporal advance in the progression of the sequence whilst leaving it behaviourally intact (kitchener and dourish 1994; vickers et al. 1996).
the present study investigates the specific role of the
 xxxg1115xxx  in mediating d-fenfluramine-induced
hypophagia by examining the effect of the compound on
food intake and postprandial feeding behaviour in mice
lacking functional 5-ht2c receptors.
preliminary accounts of these data have been presented to the society for the study of ingestive behaviour
(vickers et al. 1997) and the society for neuroscience
(dourish et al. 1997).

materials and methods
animals
the mutants were originally generated from a 129-derived es cell
line bearing a targeted disruption of the x-linked  xxxg1115xxx 
gene (brennan et al. 1997). animals were subsequently backcrossed for seven to eight generations to a c57bl/6 background.
heterozygous females were mated with wild-type males; the resulting males were hemizygous mutants hemizygous wild-types.
genotyping was performed by pcr analysis. the mutant allele
was detected using primers complimentary to neomycin resistance
gene (neo) sequences: neod (5′-caccttgctcctgccgag
aaa-3′) and neoh (5′-agaaggcgatagaaggcgatg-3′).
the wild-type allele was detected using primers derived from
 xxxg1115xxx  gene sequences flanking the neo insertion: 5n2
(5′-caacttggttgttacacacgg-3′) and 3n2 (5′-tctacc
cttctcatac tagtt-3′). for the behavioural experiments,
mice were transferred from the university of california at san
francisco to cerebrus and subsequently to the university of sussex at the age of 6 weeks.
twenty-four mice were used in the study. two mutant animals
died during the course of the study and the data presented are for
11 mutant and 11 wild-type mice. animals used in the experiments were individually housed under a 12-h light/dark cycle
(lights on: 0530 hours) with ad libitum access to standard mouse
diet and tap water. ambient temperature was 21–22°c. a red light
was the sole source of illumination during the dark period. experimenters were blind to the genotype of individual animals until
completion of the study. the work reported in this manuscript was
performed in accordance with home office regulations as outlined
in the animals (scientific procedures) act 1986.
procedures

2, clear evidence of stereotyped head movements and flat body
posture; 3, pronounced stereotyped head movements and flat body
posture.
behavioural satiety sequence
immediately after assessment for the presence of stereotypy, animals were individually observed at 30-s intervals for a period of
40 min. animals were assessed in cohorts of 12. an identical technique to that described in detail for rats (clifton et al. 1989;
vickers et al. 1996) was used. briefly, a microprocessor was programmed to illuminate individually a small led adjacent to each
cage every 2.5 s. as an led lit up, the observer struck the key on
the keyboard corresponding to the behaviour exhibited by the indicated animal. the key press turned the led off and 2.5 s later the
next led was lit. this process was repeated for the 40-min test
period. accordingly, each animal was observed every 30 s and 80
times in total. behaviour was subdivided into four mutually exclusive categories for scoring: feeding (the acquisition and eating of
the food substrate and the rare occasions where animals took a
drink); active (included locomotion, rearing and sniffing and was
used when no other category was deemed appropriate); grooming
(face and body washing and also including episodes of scratching); resting (with or without eyes closed).
the wet mash meal was presented 30 min after d-fenfluramine
(or vehicle) administration. each animal acted as its own control
and a period of at least 72 h was left between successive drug administrations. in total, each animal received three d-fenfluramine
administrations.
drugs
d-fenfluramine hydrochloride was dissolved in 0.9% saline and
administered via the intraperitoneal route. all drug administrations were in the volume 10 ml/kg and the appropriate volumes of
vehicle were used as controls.
data analysis
food intake data were analysed by two-factor anova with genotype (between-subjects) and dose (within-subjects) as factors. a
significant interaction was succeeded by performance of one-factor anova and comparisons made using bonferroni t-test. comparisons at each level of dose were made using tukey’s test. stereotypy data were analysed by two-factor anova in an identical
manner to the food consumption data.
behavioural data were organised into 5-min bins and analysed
using three-factor anova (time was an additional within-subjects factor) supplemented by the performance of planned comparisons. the four behavioural categories were analysed separately.
data analysis was performed using the genstat statistical package.

results

test diet

food intake

animals were habituated to a daily presentation of wet mash
(1 part powdered diet:1 part water). wet mash was presented on clear
plastic petri dish lids and spillage was collected at the end of each
session such that consumption was recorded to the nearest 0.1 g.

as in previous studies, mutant mice (37.5 g; n=11) were
significantly heavier than their wild-type littermates
(33.7 g; n=11) [f(1,20)=5.01, p<0.05]. furthermore, two
mutant animals died during the course of the experiment;
one death was observed to be due to a spontaneous seizure.
treatment with d-fenfluramine led to a dose-dependent decrease in food intake in both mutant and wildtype mice [main effect of dose: f(3,60)=100.3, p<0.01;

assessment of drug-induced stereotypy
mice were individually assessed for the presence of drug-induced
stereotypy 25 min after drug administration. stereotypy was rated
as 0, no stereotypy apparent; 1, equivocal stereotyped movements;

311

behavioural stereotypy
as an initial assessment of the behavioural specificity of
d-fenfluramine-induced hypophagia, the presence of behavioural stereotypy was quantified. increasing doses of
d-fenfluramine led to an increasing incidence and severity of behavioural stereotypy characterised by the presence of a flat body posture and slow stereotyped head
shakes [main effect of dose: f(3,60)=66.9, p<0.01; fig.
1b]. there was no evidence of stereotypy in either genotype after treatment with 3 mg/kg d-fenfluramine.
marked stereotypy was evident at the 10 mg/kg and
30 mg/kg doses of the drug (fig. 1b). the stereotypy observed in mutant mice in response to a challenge of
10 mg/kg d-fenfluramine was significantly greater than
that seen in wild-type animals (fig. 1b). accordingly, the
anova revealed a significant dose×genotype interaction [f(3,57)=3.77, p<0.05]. at the 10 mg/kg dose, four
wild-type and two mutant animals failed to show any
signs of stereotypy whereas administration of 30 mg/kg
d-fenfluramine led to the development of stereotypy in
all animals.

fig. 1a]. in wild-type mice, treatment with 3 mg/kg
d-fenfluramine led to a 70% reduction in the amount of
food ingested. in contrast, the same dose led to a 33%
reduction in intake by mutant animals. this difference
led to a significant dose×genotype interaction
[f(3,57)=3.47, p<0.05] and demonstrates that the hypophagic effect of d-fenfluramine is substantially reduced in mice lacking 5-ht2c receptors (fig. 1a). higher
doses of d-fenfluramine led to a greater reduction in
feeding that was similar in both genotypes. thus, in
comparison to vehicle, food consumption by mutant and
wild-type mice was reduced by 86% and 88%, respectively, after administration of 10 mg/kg d-fenfluramine
(fig. 1a).

ingestion of wet mash during the observation period led
to the development of a typical satiety sequence in control animals (fig. 2a, d). thus, with time, the incidence
of feeding declined and an increased incidence of active
behaviours and grooming, leading ultimately to the development of resting behaviour, was clearly evident. interestingly, after vehicle administration mutant animals
tended to exhibit a delayed behavioural satiety sequence
perhaps indicative of impaired satiety mechanisms.
thus, with the exception of the initial time bin there was
a higher incidence of feeding in mutant animals throughout the test period and a postponed onset of resting behaviour. such a trend is consistent with the mild obesity
observed in these mice.
in wild-type animals, treatment with 3 mg/kg d-fenfluramine led to a temporal advance in the offset of feeding [drug×time interaction: f(21,420)=16.9, p<0.01]
and onset of resting [drug×time interaction: f(21,420)
=3.47, p<0.01] whilst preserving the qualitative pattern
of behaviour characteristic of the behavioural satiety sequence (fig. 2b). hence, this drug treatment led to a significant reduction in the incidence of feeding behaviour
throughout the initial 25-min period (p<0.01) and this
was coupled with a significant increase in the incidence
of resting behaviour (p<0.05). these effects were unlikely to be attributable to the sedative properties of the
drug, since active behaviours were significantly increased in the initial time bin (p<0.01).
in contrast to the effect on the behavioural satiety sequence of wild type mice, 3 mg/kg d-fenfluramine had a
markedly reduced impact in mutant animals (fig. 2e).
although this drug dose had a modest effect on the initial incidence of feeding behaviour (p<0.05) it had no

significant effect on the incidence of resting, grooming,
or active behaviours. due to the presence of stereotypy,
higher doses of d-fenfluramine (fig. 2c, f; 30 mg/kg data
not shown) led to a pronounced reduction in the frequency of feeding (p<0.01) and a marked increase in the incidence of resting that was present even in initial time bins
(p<0.01).

discussion
the present data demonstrate for the first time that the
behavioural satiety sequence is observed in mice and that
d-fenfluramine inhibits mouse feeding behaviour by enhancing satiety. the data also indicate that this hypophagia is mediated in large part by stimulation of the 5-ht2c
receptor subtype, since mice lacking these receptors exhibit a reduced response to a satiating dose of d-fenfluramine; indeed, at such a dose d-fenfluramine had a
markedly reduced impact on the behavioural satiety sequence.

these results are compatible with reports in rats that
d-fenfluramine reduces food consumption in a manner
compatible with the enhancement of satiety (blundell
and mcarthur 1978; vickers et al. 1996). however, the
data contrast with the observation that post-prandial resting is reduced after fenfluramine treatment in food-deprived rats (montgomery and willner 1988; willner et
al. 1990). the present data are also in good agreement
with studies that have reported either a complete or partial blockade of d-fenfluramine-induced hypophagia by
the 5-ht2a/2c antagonist ritanserin (neill and cooper
1989; goodall et al. 1993), the 5-ht2b/2c antagonist sb200646 (hartley et al. 1995) and the selective 5-ht2c
antagonist sb-242084 (trail et al. 1998). the findings
are also consistent with reports that  xxxg1115xxx  agonists decrease food consumption in rats (kennett and
curzon 1998a,b).
since the hypophagic effect of d-fenfluramine was
not completely abolished in  xxxg1115xxx  knockout
mice, it is possible that other 5-ht receptor subtypes
mediate this residual hypophagia. indeed, one likely
candidate is the  xxxg1109xxx  as the effects of d-fenfluramine have been reported to be blocked in rats by
pre-treatment with the 5-ht1a/1b antagonist (±)-cyanopindolol (neill and cooper 1989) and the hypophagic
effect of racemic fenfluramine was absent in food-deprived 5-ht1b knockout mice (lucas et al. 1998). surprisingly, however, the selective 5-ht1b antagonist gr-

313

127935 had no effect on the reduction of food intake induced by fenfluramine (hartley et al. 1995; trail et al.
1998).
hypothalamic 5-ht2c receptors may prove to be a
crucial neural substrate for mediating, at least in part, the
hypophagic effects of d-fenfluramine, since in vitro evidence suggests that d-fenfluramine is ineffective in stimulating hypothalamic  xxxd1752xxx -releasing factor release from the hypothalami of 5-ht2c knockout mice
(j. raber and l. tecott, personal communication). furthermore, administration of the 5-ht2c agonist tfmpp
into the paraventricular nucleus (pvn) of the hypothalamus dose-dependently decreased food intake in rats
(hutson et al. 1988). however, such a role for hypothalamic 5-ht2c receptors remains speculative, since d-fenfluramine inhibits food intake in rats with lesions of the
pvn (fletcher et al. 1993).
the behavioural stereotypy observed in the mice after
d-fenfluramine administration was similar to the serotonin syndrome which has been extensively described in
rats (jacobs 1976). the stereotypy induced by high doses
of d-fenfluramine was significantly enhanced in mutant
animals and the mechanism mediating this effect is unclear at present. the syndrome resembled that seen after
administration of 5-ht agonists and one potential explanation is that developmental or neuroadaptive changes
may lead to alterations in serotonergic neurotransmission
in the mutant mice. alternatively,  xxxg1115xxx  stimulation may oppose d-fenfluramine-induced stereotypy
in addition to inducing a hypophagic response.
it is unlikely that the differences observed in mutant
and wild-type animals after treatment with d-fenfluramine are due to differences in the pharmacokinetics of
d-fenfluramine in these animals. thus, no simple pharmacokinetic explanation could account for d-fenfluramine having a blunted effect on feeding-related behaviours in mutants yet an enhanced effect on the incidence
of stereotypy in the same animals.
the observation that the hypophagic effect of 3
mg/kg d-fenfluramine is greatly reduced in mutant mice
lacking 5-ht2c receptors suggests that a selective agonist at this receptor subtype may prove to be a novel and
useful therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity.
however, there is evidence that anorectic doses of the
non-selective 5-ht1b/2c agonist mcpp elicit hypolocomotion and anxiogenesis in a social interaction test
(kennett et al. 1994). indeed, the selective  xxxg1115xxx  antagonist sb-242084 has anxiolytic-like effects
in several animal models of anxiety (kennett et al.
1997). interestingly, a recent study demonstrated weight
loss in moderately obese subjects given mcpp at a dose
which did not affect ratings of nausea or light-headedness (sargent et al. 1997). finally, the use of a selective
5-ht2c agonist could avoid the recently reported cardiac
valvular dysfunction observed after fenfluramine administration (connolly et al. 1997) as 5-ht2c receptors are
present in high density in the brain but are present in low
density or are absent in peripheral tissues (hoyer et al.
1994).
