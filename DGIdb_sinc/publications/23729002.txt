abstract the recombinant analogue of human glucagonlike peptide-2 (glp-2)  xxxd3300xxx  (gattexò, revestiveò)
is a novel therapy for short bowel syndrome (sbs). glp-2
is a naturally occurring hormone that regulates the growth,
proliferation and maintenance of cells lining the gastrointestinal tract. subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  is the first longterm medical therapy approved for the treatment of adult
patients with sbs who are dependent on parenteral support
(parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluids). in a pivotal,
double-blind, multicentre, phase iii study in adult patients
with sbs who were dependent on parenteral support, a
significantly higher proportion of  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/
day recipients than placebo recipients achieved at least a
20 % reduction from baseline in weekly parenteral support
volume at week 20 and maintained at week 24 (primary
endpoint). the overall mean reduction in weekly parenteral
support volume from baseline was greater in patients who
received  xxxd3300xxx  compared with those who received
placebo. additionally, more  xxxd3300xxx -treated patients

achieved at least a one-day reduction in parenteral support
than those receiving placebo. subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx 
had an acceptable tolerability profile; the most frequently
reported adverse events were of gastrointestinal origin,
consistent with the underlying disease condition and the
known mechanism of action of  xxxd3300xxx .

1 introduction
short bowel syndrome (sbs), a serious and highly disabling condition, results from either loss of portions of
intestine or loss of critical intestinal function, whereby the
amount of remaining functional gut is too short to allow for
adequate absorption of nutrients and fluids [1–3]. sbs can
be a consequence of surgical resection, congenital defects,
trauma or disease-associated loss of absorption [1–3]. in

936

adults, the most common cause of sbs is extensive surgical resection (e.g. for vascular disease, crohn’s disease,
trauma or cancer) [1]. although the symptom complex
varies among patients, sbs is characterised by diarrhoea,
steatorrhoea, abdominal pain, electrolyte disturbances,
dehydration and malnutrition [2, 3]. these symptoms are
due to loss of absorptive surface, site-specific transport
processes, site-specific endocrine cells and gastrointestinal
(gi) hormones, and/or ileocecal valve [1–3].
during the first couple of years following surgery, the
remnant intestine has the ability to adapt in order to compensate for the reduction of absorptive surface area [1, 2, 4].
structural adaptation involves increases in villus height,
crypt cell depth and enterocyte proliferation, while functional adaptation refers primarily to a slowing of the transit
time of the bowel, thus allowing for an increased time for
absorption to occur [1, 2, 4]. the process of adaptation has
been linked to a host of trophic hormones and peptides [1, 2,
4]. glucagon-like peptide-2 (glp-2), a hormone that regulates the growth, proliferation and maintenance of cells
lining the gi tract, may play a major role in modulating
bowel adaptation and nutrient absorption in humans [5].
the adaptive process is a highly variable process, yielding
different levels of symptom control in each patient [1, 2].
the effective management of patients with sbs requires
a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach [2, 3, 6].
furthermore, treatment should be individualized because of
the considerable differences in remnant bowel anatomy and
function, psychosocial traits and personal lifestyles
between patients [2, 3, 6]. the overall treatment goal is
intestinal rehabilitation, a process of maximizing the
digestive and absorptive capacity of the remnant gi tract
[7]. medical management of sbs may be accomplished
pharmacologically (antidiarrheal agents [e.g. loperamide,
codeine], antisecretory agents [e.g. h2-receptor antagonists, proton-pump inhibitors,  xxxg890xxx 
antagonists] and supplementation of vitamins, minerals and
intravenous fluids), through dietary manipulations, parenteral nutrition or intestinal transplantation [6–8].
in the absence of sufficient intestinal adaptation, many
patients remain dependent on long-term parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluids (parenteral support) to
maintain fluid, electrolyte, trace element, vitamin and
nutrient balances [6]. in 1992, it was estimated there were
&10,000 patients with sbs in north america who were
dependent on home parenteral nutrition [9]. moreover,
long-term parenteral support is invasive, associated with
numerous complications (e.g. catheter-related infections,
biliary complications, venous occlusions and hepatic dysfunction) and deleterious effects on health-related quality
of life [1, 7].
growth factors and other trophic hormones have been
used to enhance intestinal adaptation [10]. recombinant

c. b. burness, p. l. mccormack

human growth hormone was the first medication approved
by the us fda specifically for use in patients with sbs in
conjunction with specialized nutritional support [1].
however, the use of growth hormone has been limited,
largely owing to concerns with regard to efficacy and the
fact that only short-term use was approved, with  xxxd3223xxx  and l-glutamine approved for use up to 4 and
16 weeks, respectively, in the usa [8, 11, 12].
until recently, there were no targeted long-term medical
treatments aimed at intestinal rehabilitation to promote
absorption of fluid and nutrients [6, 8, 11].  xxxd3300xxx 
(gattexò, revestiveò) is a novel intestinotrophic agent [13,
14]. it is a recombinant human glp-2 analogue with a
single amino acid substitution that substantially extends its
half-life compared with native glp-2, allowing it to be
administered once daily by subcutaneous injection [13–16].
it is the first long-term medical therapy to be approved as a
treatment for adults with sbs who are dependent on parenteral support in the usa [13] and eu [14].
data sources: medical literature (including published
and unpublished data) on  xxxd3300xxx  in patients with
short bowel syndrome was identified by searching
databases including medline (from 1946) and embase (from 1996) [searches last updated 6 may 2013],
bibliographies from published literature, clinical trial
registries/databases and websites (including those of
regional regulatory agencies and the manufacturer).
additional information (including contributory unpublished data) was also requested from the company
developing the drug.
search terms:  xxxd3300xxx , short bowel syndrome.
study selection: studies in patients with short bowel
syndrome who received  xxxd3300xxx . inclusion of studies was based mainly on the methods section of the
trials. when available, large, well-designed, comparative trials with appropriate statistical methodology were
preferred. relevant pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data are also included.

2 pharmacodynamic properties
data on the pharmacodynamic properties of subcutaneous
 xxxd3300xxx  are derived from studies in healthy subjects
[17–19] or patients with sbs [20–22]. additional data were
obtained from the eu summary of product characteristics
(spc) [14] and the us prescribing information [13].

 xxxd3300xxx : a review

937

2.1 mechanism of action
 xxxd3300xxx  is an analogue of naturally occurring human
glp-2 (a peptide secreted by l cells of the distal intestine
in response to luminal nutrients) that is manufactured in
escherichia coli using recombinant technology [13, 14].
 xxxd3300xxx  has been shown to preserve mucosal integrity
by promoting repair and normal growth of the intestine
through an increase of villus height and crypt depth [13,
14]. glp-2 is known to increase intestinal and portal blood
flow, inhibit gastric acid secretion and decrease intestinal
motility [23].  xxxd3300xxx  binds to the glp-2 receptors
located in intestinal subpopulations of enteroendocrine
cells, subepithelial myofibroblasts, and enteric neurons of
the submucosal and myenteric plexus [23]. activation of
these receptors results in the local release of multiple
mediators, including insulin-like growth factor-1, nitric
oxide and keratinocyte growth factor [23].
2.2 effects on gastrointestinal absorption
results of a 21-day, open-label, multicentre, pharmacodynamic study (n = 17) suggested that subcutaneous
 xxxd3300xxx  0.03, 0.10 or 0.15 mg/kg/day could benefit
parenteral support-dependent patients with sbs in several
ways (see table 1) [20].
compared with baseline, 21 days of  xxxd3300xxx  treatment increased intestinal wet weight absorption and
reduced faecal wet weight, as measured by 72-h metabolic
balance studies (see table 1) [20]. in addition to the
decrease in ostomy output, urine output increased by
approximately 500 ml/day from baseline levels, demonstrating increased intestinal absorption of fluids and

nutrients while parenteral support volume and oral intake
were maintained at stable levels throughout the 21-day
study [20]. subgroup analyses revealed similar improvements in patients with end jejunostomy and in patients with
c50 % colon continuity [20].
 xxxd3300xxx  was associated with some improvements in
energy and macronutrient absorption [20]. a significant
decrease in faecal energy excretion was observed (table 1)
[20]. however, this reduction in energy excretion did not
translate into an overall significant effect with respect to
absolute or relative energy absorption, possibly because of
variability in dietary energy intake [20]. no significant
effect on intestinal fat or nitrogen absorption was demonstrated [20]. consistent effects on energy balance were
observed following 24 weeks of  xxxd3300xxx  treatment in a
72-h metabolic balance sub-study as part of a placebocontrolled, phase iii trial in patients with sbs (study 004;
see sect. 4.1 for trial details) [21].
absorption of some electrolytes improved during  xxxd3300xxx  treatment, with corresponding decreases in excretion of faecal and stomal fluid in the same study [20]. for
example, faecal potassium levels were reduced by
12 mmol/day after 21 days of treatment (p \ 0.05 vs.
baseline), while faecal sodium levels were reduced by
25 mmol/day. urinary sodium excretion was increased by
53 mmol/day (p \ 0.001 vs. baseline) [20].
in sbs patients with distal bowel resections, malabsorption is not only caused by a reduction in absorptive
area, but also by the disruption of the ileal brake feedback
mechanism regulated by hormones such as glp-1 and -2
and  xxxd1348xxx  [6, 24]. the lack of this meal-stimulated
hormonal feedback leads to gastric hypersecretion, rapid
gastric and intestinal transit, and poor intestinal adaptation

ten patients with an end jejunostomy received subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  0.03 (n = 2), 0.10 (n = 5) or 0.15 (n = 3) mg/kg/day, 5 patients with
c50 % colon continuity received 0.10 mg/kg/day, and the patient with\50 % colon continuity received 0.03 mg/kg/day. no dose-related effects
were observed; therefore, data were pooled

938

[24]. the physiological feedback associated with the ileal
brake mechanism appears to be restored during treatment
with  xxxd3300xxx  in patients with an end jejunostomy [20].
in addition to 72-h metabolic balance studies, the phase
ii trial examined the histological changes in bowel biopsies
obtained from eight patients with end-jejunostomy [20].
significant structural adaptations in the intestinal mucosa
of the jejunum were seen in seven of the eight  xxxd3300xxx 
recipients [20]. for instance, significant increases from
baseline in villus height (38 %; p = 0.030), crypt depth
(22 %; p = 0.010) and mitotic index (115 %; p = 0.010)
were observed after 21 days of  xxxd3300xxx  treatment [20].
these findings were confirmed after 24 weeks of treatment
with  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day in study 004 [21, 25].
of note, the improvements in intestinal absorption,
decreases in faecal excretion and histological changes
observed after treatment with  xxxd3300xxx  had reversed at
follow up on days 39–42 after study completion (i.e.
18–21 days drug-free) [20].
2.3 effects on body composition
lean body mass, measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, was increased by 0.82 kg in  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/
kg/day recipients and decreased by 0.52 kg in placebo
recipients after 24 weeks of treatment in study 004, suggesting that intestinal energy and/or fluid absorption was
improved with  xxxd3300xxx  [21]. fat mass was reduced by
1.6 and 3.8 % in  xxxd3300xxx  and placebo recipients,
respectively. a numerical increase in total body bone
mineral content was observed in  xxxd3300xxx  recipients
versus placebo recipients (?0.009 vs. -0.016 kg) [21].
the effect of  xxxd3300xxx  on bodyweight is discussed in
sect. 4.
2.4 effects on plasma citrulline
plasma citrulline, an amino acid produced by enterocytes
of the intestinal mucosa, is regarded as a biomarker of the
functional enterocyte mass (i.e. a decrease in citrulline
levels reflects a decrease in enterocyte mass) [26]. in
general, plasma levels of citrulline were increased from
baseline following  xxxd3300xxx  administration in patients
with sbs [21, 22]. in two placebo-controlled phase iii
studies (004 and 020; see sect. 4 for study details), plasma
citrulline levels at week 24 were significantly (p b 0.0001)
higher than baseline levels in patients receiving  xxxd3300xxx 
0.05 mg/kg/day, whereas plasma citrulline levels were not
significantly changed in placebo recipients [21, 22].
according to additional data from the extension phase of
study 004, plasma citrulline was significantly (p = 0.0001)
increased by 68 % after a total of 52 weeks of  xxxd3300xxx 
treatment [27]. four weeks after treatment withdrawal,

c. b. burness, p. l. mccormack

plasma citrulline levels decreased by 20 %; however, levels did remain higher than baseline levels (i.e. at the start of
the placebo-controlled trial) [27].
2.5 other effects
subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  4 mg once daily for 10 days had
no significant effect on gastric emptying, as measured by
paracetamol (acetaminophen) pharmacokinetics in a placebo-controlled trial in 36 healthy volunteers [18, 19].
there were no significant differences in the area under the
serum concentration-time curve (auc) from time zero to
the last measurable concentration, auc from time zero to
infinity (auc?) or peak serum concentrations (cmax) of
paracetamol between  xxxd3300xxx  and placebo recipients on
day 0 or day 10 [18, 19].
subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  4 mg/day had no clinically
significant effect on serum insulin, glucagon or glucose
levels in healthy volunteers [18].
therapeutic and supratherapeutic dosages of  xxxd3300xxx 
did not have a significant effect on cardiac repolarization,
according to results of a ‘thorough corrected qt (qtc)
interval study’ in 72 volunteers [17]. furthermore,  xxxd3300xxx  had no relevant effect on other ecg parameters
(e.g. qrs interval), t or u wave morphology, or heart rate
[17].
as  xxxd3300xxx  is a recombinant therapeutic protein,
there is potential for formation of antibodies to  xxxd3300xxx 
and to e. coli protein (residual host cell protein from the
manufacture) [13, 14]. in clinical trials, non-neutralizing
antibodies to  xxxd3300xxx , as well as antibodies to e. coli
protein were detected in  xxxd3300xxx  recipients (see sect. 5)
[13, 14, 22]. the development of anti- xxxd3300xxx  antibodies has not been associated with any clinically relevant
effects on the efficacy or tolerability or pharmacokinetics
of  xxxd3300xxx  during up to 1.5 years of treatment [13, 14].
based upon the pharmacodynamic effect of  xxxd3300xxx ,
there is a potential for increased absorption of concomitant
oral medications such as benzodiazepines and psychotropic
agents [13]. in clinical trials, altered mental status during
concomitant treatment with  xxxd3300xxx  and benzodiazepines has been observed (see sect. 5.3) [13]. therefore, it is
recommended that patients receiving concurrent therapy
with oral drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines, phenothiazines)
requiring titration or with a narrow therapeutic index may
require dose adjustment of their concurrent therapy while
receiving  xxxd3300xxx  [13].

3 pharmacokinetic properties
the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  have
been investigated in healthy volunteers [15, 16], patients

additional data are available from the us prescribing
information [13]. dosages and patient populations are
specified where available.

similar to the glomerular filtration rate, suggesting that
 xxxd3300xxx  is primarily eliminated via the kidneys [13].

3.1 absorption and distribution

age and gender had no clinically relevant effect on the
pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3300xxx  [13]. bodyweight was
identified as a covariate; in general, an increase in bodyweight was associated with increases in the volume of
distribution and the elimination half-life of  xxxd3300xxx 
[16].
decreasing renal function was found to be associated
with increased  xxxd3300xxx  exposure [13]. relative to
individuals with normal renal function, the auc? and
cmax values of  xxxd3300xxx  were greater (up to 2.6- and 2.1fold, respectively) in individuals with progressive renal
impairment up to and including end-stage renal disease
(see sect. 6 for dosing recommendations) [13].
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3300xxx  were not altered to
any clinically significant extent in individuals with moderate hepatic impairment [13]. the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd3300xxx  have not been assessed in severe hepatic
impairment [11].
no formal drug-drug interaction studies have been
conducted in patients with sbs receiving  xxxd3300xxx  [13].
in vitro studies revealed no significant inhibition or
induction of tested cyp isozymes at a  xxxd3300xxx  concentration of 2 lg/ml [11]. furthermore,  xxxd3300xxx  was
neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of p-glycoprotein at a
concentrations above 2 lg/ml [11]. thus, it is considered
that the potential for cyp or p-glycoprotein-related pharmacokinetic drug interactions with  xxxd3300xxx  is low.

the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  (across
the dosage range of 2.5–80 mg once daily) were best
described by a one-compartment model with a site-specific
first-order constant of absorption in the abdomen, arm and
thigh, as assessed in a population pharmacokinetic modelling study using data from several trials in healthy volunteers and patients with sbs [16].  xxxd3300xxx  displays
linear pharmacokinetics, with exposure to the drug
increasing in proportion to the dose over the dose range of
10 to 80 mg [15]. there was minimal accumulation of
 xxxd3300xxx  following repeated subcutaneous administration in healthy volunteers [15].
 xxxd3300xxx  was rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration, with the cmax of  xxxd3300xxx  attained
approximately 3–5 h after single and multiple doses in
healthy volunteers [13]. in patients with sbs, the median
cmax of  xxxd3300xxx  was 36 ng/ml and the median auc?
was 0.15 lgh/ml following a 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous
dose of  xxxd3300xxx  [13].
following a single dose of  xxxd3300xxx  0.12 mg/kg
administered subcutaneously into the abdomen, the mean
absolute bioavailability of  xxxd3300xxx  was approximately
87 % in healthy volunteers [15]. the relative bioavailabilities of  xxxd3300xxx  when administered into the thigh and
arm, compared with abdominal administration, were 86.5
and 89.2 %, respectively [15].
the volume of distribution of  xxxd3300xxx  is 103 ml/kg
in healthy volunteers, which is similar to blood volume [11,
13], suggesting that  xxxd3300xxx  was not widely distributed
throughout the body and was primarily retained in the
intravascular compartment.
3.2 metabolism and excretion
the metabolic pathway of  xxxd3300xxx  has not been
investigated in humans [13]. since  xxxd3300xxx  is a peptide,
it is not likely to be metabolized by common drug
metabolizing enzymes (e.g. cytochrome p450 [cyp] isozymes,  xxxd3476xxx  glucuronyltransferase, glutathione-s-transferase) [13]. it is likely that  xxxd3300xxx  is
metabolized via hydrolytic degradation, like native glp-2,
to form small peptides and amino acids [13].
the terminal elimination half-life of  xxxd3300xxx  was
&2 h in healthy subjects and &1.3 h in patients with sbs
[13]. following intravenous administration, the plasma
clearance of  xxxd3300xxx  was &123 ml/h/kg, which is

3.3 special patient populations and drug interactions

4 therapeutic efficacy
the clinical efficacy of  xxxd3300xxx  in the treatment of adult
patients with sbs was evaluated in two 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre,
phase iii studies: study 004 (n = 83) [21] and study 020
(steps [study of  xxxd3300xxx  effectiveness in parenteral
nutrition-dependent sbs subjects]; n = 86) [22]. longterm efficacy and safety of  xxxd3300xxx  has also been
demonstrated in two extension studies: study 005 (n = 52)
[27] and 021 (n = 88; available as a poster) [29].
key trial details and patient characteristics at baseline
are shown in table 2. briefly, adults (aged c18 years) with
sbs secondary to intestinal surgery and at least 12 continuous months of parenteral support dependency were
eligible [21, 22]. parenteral support dependency was
defined as requiring parenteral nutrition and/or iv fluids at
least three times per week to meet caloric, fluid or electrolyte needs [21, 22].

both studies consisted of two stages [21, 22]. the first
stage included a screening visit and optimization (up to
8 weeks) and stabilization (4 to 8 weeks) periods [21, 22].
during the optimization period, the goal was to establish a
urine output of 1.0–2.0 l/day [21, 22]. during the stabilization period, parenteral support usage was to match
prescribed parenteral support, and oral fluid intake and
urine volume could not deviate more than 25 % from the
optimized levels [21, 22]. although the osmolality and oral
intake were not strictly controlled, patients were asked to
try to keep the timing, quantity and quality of beverages as
constant as possible during the 48 h collection periods so
that increased intestinal fluid absorption would be reflected
in increased urinary output [21, 22]. for the second stage,
patients underwent randomization and a 24-week treatment
period [21, 22].
4.1 study 004
eligible patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous
 xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day (n = 35),  xxxd3300xxx  0.10
mg/kg/day (n = 32) or placebo (n = 16) once daily in study
004 [21]. a strict parenteral support weaning algorithm

was followed during treatment that allowed for no more
than a 10 % reduction in parenteral support volume at
4-week intervals [21].
the primary efficacy endpoint was initially a dichotomous responder criterion (percentage of patients who
demonstrated a c20 % reduction from baseline in weekly
parenteral support volume at weeks 20 and 24); however,
an expanded primary endpoint was later introduced to
compare  xxxd3300xxx  with placebo in terms of a graded
response score criterion assessed in the intent-to-treat (itt)
population. the graded response score criterion accounted
for intensity and duration of response at the end of the
24-week period (from 20–100 % reduction in weekly
parenteral volume and the responses from weeks 16 to 20
and weeks 20 and 24) [21]. the statistical analysis plan for
the primary endpoint specified a step-down procedure that
required  xxxd3300xxx  0.10 mg/kg/day to be statistically
significantly greater than placebo before evaluation of the
0.05 mg/kg/day dosage [21].
 xxxd3300xxx  0.10 mg/kg/day was no more effective than
placebo for reducing parenteral support requirements in
adults with sbs who were dependent on parenteral support
as indicated by the primary efficacy endpoint analysis (a

 xxxd3300xxx : a review

graded categorical score) which revealed no statistically
significant differences between the  xxxd3300xxx  0.10 mg/kg/
day and placebo groups at 24 weeks [21]. the authors
suggest that limitations in the study design, the parenteral
support weaning algorithm and an imbalance between the
treatment groups at baseline in the parenteral support
requirements (parenteral volume and parenteral energy
requirements at baseline were 1816 ml/day and 5296
kj/day, respectively, in the  xxxd3300xxx  0.10 mg/kg/day group
compared with 1531 ml/day and 3385 kj/day, respectively,
in the placebo group) may account for the lack of a significant
difference between the  xxxd3300xxx  0.10 mg/kg/day group and
the placebo group for the primary endpoint [21]. therefore,
further efficacy findings for this dosage are not, presented
here; this section focuses instead on exploratory findings
for the 0.05 mg/kg/day dosage, which is the recommended
dosage subsequently approved by the regulatory authorities in
the eu [14] and usa [13] (see sect. 6).
analysis of the primary endpoint revealed that  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day was associated with significantly
(p = 0.007) improvements in the graded response score
compared with placebo [21]. however, these results are
considered hypothesis generating only, because the prespecified statistical analysis plan for the primary endpoint
stated that no further statistical testing was to be done if the
 xxxd3300xxx  0.10 mg/kg/day dosage was not found to be
significant [21].
the proportion of patients who were responders was
also significantly higher in the  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day
arm compared with the placebo arm (46 vs. 6 %;
p = 0.005) [21].
at week 24, parenteral support volume was reduced from
baseline by 2.5 l/week in patients receiving  xxxd3300xxx  (at
both dose levels) compared with a reduction of 0.9 l/week in
placebo recipients [21]. furthermore, two patients receiving
 xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day were completely weaned off
parenteral support at 24 weeks [21]. at baseline, one patient
had been receiving 5.4 l of parenteral support per week for
25 years and the other patient had been receiving 3.5 l of
parenteral support per week for 6.5 years [21].
 xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day significantly (p \ 0.05)
increased bodyweight, compared with placebo, at weeks 4,
8 and 16 in patients with sbs who were dependent on
parenteral support [21]. non-significant increases were
observed at the other time points [21]. after 24 weeks,
mean increases in bodyweight were 1.2 kg in  xxxd3300xxx 
recipients and 0.2 kg in placebo recipients, these changes
were driven by improvements in lean body mass [21].
4.2 study 020
the results of study 004 [21] supported the rationale for the
use of the 0.05 mg/kg/day dosage of  xxxd3300xxx  in the 020

941

study, which is the pivotal clinical trial of  xxxd3300xxx  [22].
eligible patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous
 xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day (n = 43) or placebo (n = 43)
once daily [22]. a strict parenteral support weaning algorithm was followed during treatment that allowed for parenteral support volume reduction of 10–30 % [22].
the primary endpoint was the responder rate, defined as
the percentage of patients who attained a 20–100 %
reduction from baseline in weekly parenteral support volume at week 20 with this response maintained at week 24
[22].
in adult patients with sbs who were dependent on
parenteral support, subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/
day was effective in reducing parenteral support fluid
requirements, as indicated by a significantly higher
responder rates (primary endpoint) in the  xxxd3300xxx  group
than in the placebo group (63 vs. 30 %; p = 0.002) [22].
analyses of the secondary efficacy measures and
exploratory endpoints generally supported the benefit of
 xxxd3300xxx  [22]. for example, patients receiving  xxxd3300xxx  achieved a greater absolute reduction from baseline in
parenteral support volume compared with patients receiving placebo at all visits, beginning at week 4 (1.1 vs. 0.5
l/week) through to week 24 (4.4 vs. 2.3 l/week secondary
endpoint), with statistically significant (p b 0.05) differences observed from week 8 until study end at week 24
[22].
in terms of exploratory analyses, the proportion of
patients who achieved a reduction from baseline of
20–100 % in prescribed weekly parenteral support was also
significantly higher with  xxxd3300xxx  than placebo at week
24 (77 vs. 46 %; p = 0.01) [22]. furthermore, 54 % of
 xxxd3300xxx -treated subjects experienced at least one additional day off parenteral support at 24 weeks, compared
with 23 % of placebo recipients (p = 0.005) [22]. corresponding proportions of patients who gained more than two
additional days off parenteral support were 21 and 8 % at
24 weeks [22]. however, no patients were completely
weaned from parenteral support at week 24 during study
020 [22].
 xxxd3300xxx  was also associated with significantly
greater reductions in the fluid composite effect, a putative
measure of intestinal fluid absorption (defined as defined
as summation of the increase in urine production, reduction in parenteral nutrition and/or intravenous fluid volume and reduction in oral fluid intake [l/week]) than
placebo [22]. at week 24, the fluid composite effect was
reduced from baseline by 5.4 l/week in  xxxd3300xxx 
recipients, compared with a reduction of 1.1 l/week in
placebo recipients (p \ 0.0006) [22]. of note, oral fluid
intake was significantly higher in placebo recipients than
 xxxd3300xxx  recipients at weeks 12, 20 and 24 (all
p \ 0.05) [22].

942

over the 24-week treatment period,  xxxd3300xxx  recipients experienced a mean increase in bodyweight of 1.0 kg,
while placebo recipients had a mean decrease in bodyweight of 0.6 kg [22].
4.2.1 health-related quality of life
health-related quality of life (qol) was an exploratory
outcome measure of study 020, which was investigated a
subset of the per-protocol population (n = 35  xxxd3300xxx 
and 35 placebo recipients) [30]. in this analysis, the short
bowel syndrome-quality of life scale (sbs-qol), a newly
validated scale comprising of 17 items (divided into two
subscales comprising 11 and 6 items), was used to assess
the burden of sbs on patients’ health-related qol [30].
the total score ranged from 0 (perfect) to 170 (worst), with
individual items rated on a 100 mm visual analogue scale
[30].
according to the primary hr-qol analysis, three factors significantly influenced on the change in qol from
baseline to week 24 in patients with sbs who were
dependent on parenteral support [30]. these three factors
were parenteral support volume reduction (p = 0.0194),
baseline sbs-qol score (p = 0.0009) and the interaction
between treatment and parenteral support volume reduction
(p = 0.0290); in contrast, the factor ‘treatment’ was found
to have no significant influence [30].
 xxxd3300xxx  significantly improved sbs-qol total
(69.0 vs. 79.7 points at baseline; p = 0.0038), subscale one
(48.4 vs. 53.1 points; p = 0.0109) and subscale two (24.2
vs. 26.7 points; p = 0.0225) scores from baseline to week
24 [30]. no significant changes were observed in the placebo group. however, the changes in sbs-qol observed
in the  xxxd3300xxx  group were not significant compared
with placebo [30].
 xxxd3300xxx  significantly (p \ 0.05) reduced the scores
of 9 of the 17 individual items (including diarrhoea/stomal
output, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep and everyday
activities) of the sbs-qol scale from baseline at week 24
[30]. only diarrhoea/stomal output was significantly
reduced in the placebo group (p = 0.001) [30].

discusses results for the 0.05 mg/kg/day dosage from these
trials; some data available as abstracts [29, 31].
4.3.1 study 005
study 005 enrolled 65 of 71 eligible patients, i.e., those
who had completed study 004. patients who had originally
received  xxxd3300xxx  continued receiving  xxxd3300xxx  0.05
(n = 25) or 0.10 mg/kg/day (n = 27) in study 005, while
those who had previously received placebo were randomized to receive 0.05 (n = 6) or 0.10 mg/kg/day (n = 7) for
28 weeks [31]. data are reported for the 52 patients
( xxxd3300xxx  0.05 [n = 25] or 0.10 mg/kg/day [n = 27])
who received a total of 52 weeks of  xxxd3300xxx  therapy
during the combined treatment period of the placebo-controlled and the extension studies [27].
improvements in parenteral support requirements were
generally maintained during long-term treatment (i.e.
52 weeks) with  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day in patients
with sbs who were dependent on parenteral support [27].
at the end of the combined 52 week treatment period,
68 % of patients in the  xxxd3300xxx  group were responders
(reductions of c20 % of baseline parenteral support volume [i.e. start of study 004]) [27].
following 52 weeks of  xxxd3300xxx  treatment, parenteral
support volume was reduced from baseline (in initial placebo-controlled trial) by 4.9 l/week (52 %), intravenous
energy intake was reduced by 3511.09 kcal/week and 68 %
of patients had experienced at least one additional day off
parenteral support [27]. moreover, 75 % of patients who
were responders in study 004 (i.e. at 24 weeks), while
receiving  xxxd3300xxx , remained responders at 52 weeks
[27]. two  xxxd3300xxx  recipients who were weaned off
parenteral support during study 004 (see sect. 4.1)
remained completely weaned off parenteral support at the
end of the 28-week extension [27, 31]. furthermore, one
additional patient was weaned off parenteral support during
the extension study [27].
four weeks after treatment withdrawal, mean parenteral
support volume was increased from 4.0 l/week at the end
of the 52-week treatment period to 5.5 l/week in  xxxd3300xxx  recipients [27].

4.3 long-term extension studies
4.3.2 study 021
because sbs is a chronic disease, it is important to
understand whether patients experience continued benefit
with  xxxd3300xxx  therapy during long-term use. patients
from the two placebo-controlled trials could enrol in
extension trials. study 005 was a 28-week, randomized,
double-blind, multicentre extension of study 004 [27],
while study 021 (steps-2) is a 2-year open-label extension of the pivotal 020 trial [29]. this section briefly

the extension study (steps-2) included 88 patients, of
whom 37 patients had previously received  xxxd3300xxx , 39
patients had received placebo and 12 patients had been
optimized and stabilized during study 020 but not treated or
included in that trial [29]. there were no significant differences between groups for the mean parenteral support
volume required or mean number of days per week of

 xxxd3300xxx : a review

support volume required at baseline [29]. all patients
received subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day [29].
according to interim results of study 021, treatment
with  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day was associated with a
durable response, as reflected by continued improvements
in and the maintenance of reductions in parenteral support
needs in patients with sbs who were dependent on parenteral support [29].
at last follow-up (31 may 2012), 74 of the 88
patients enrolled in the extension trial had received
12 months of  xxxd3300xxx  therapy in the extension study
[29]. of these patients, 68 % achieved a 20–100 %
reduction in parenteral support volume from baseline (i.e.
start of initial placebo-controlled phase [study 020]) [29].
of the 37 patients originally randomised to  xxxd3300xxx 
in study 020, 88 % achieved clinically meaningful
reductions from baseline in parenteral support volume
after a total of 18 months (6 months of treatment in
study 020 and 12 months in study 021) of  xxxd3300xxx 
treatment [29].
during the extension study, additional clinically meaningful reductions in parenteral support volumes were
observed over those seen in study 020 [29]. in patients who
had received  xxxd3300xxx  throughout (total 18 months’
treatment), parenteral support volumes reduced from 7.6
l/week at the start of the extension study to 5.8 l/week at
18 months (baseline at the start of study 020 was 12.9
l/week) [29]. a reduction in parenteral support volume
was also observed in patients who switched from placebo
to  xxxd3300xxx  therapy in the extension study, with support
volumes reducing from 10.5 l/week at the start of the
extension study to 8.4 l/week at 18 months (baseline
13.2 l/week) [29]. similar improvements were also seen in
patients who had not been included in study 020 and who
had started  xxxd3300xxx  therapy during the extension study
[29]. furthermore, following 12 months of  xxxd3300xxx 
treatment in the extension study, 38 of 74 patients (51 %)
experienced at least one additional day off parenteral
support [29].
in addition, some patients achieved complete independence from parenteral support during the first year of
the extension study [29]. as of 16 october 2012, complete independence from parenteral support was achieved
in 12 (14 %) of 88 patients after 28–114 weeks of
treatment with  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day [29]. at
baseline, parenteral support requirement in these patients
ranged between 3.5 and 13.4 l/week and they had been
receiving parenteral support for 2–19 years. although
demographics and disease characteristics varied widely
among the completely weaned patients, more of them had
colon-in-continuity (&67 % of patients) and lower
baseline parenteral support requirements (i.e. \7 l/week;
&67 %) [29].

5 tolerability
discussion in this section focuses on tolerability data from
the two phase iii trials (study 004 [safety population
n = 83] and 020 [safety population n = 85]; see sect. 4 for
study details) [21, 22]. these data are supplemented with
information from the us prescribing information [13] and
the spc [14]. while study 004 included a  xxxd3300xxx 
0.10 mg/kg/day arm, discussion in this section focuses on
the recommended  xxxd3300xxx  dosage of 0.05 mg/kg/day,
unless stated otherwise.
5.1 short-term tolerability
subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  was generally well tolerated in
adult patients with sbs who were dependent on parenteral
support [21, 22]. the most frequently reported adverse
events were usually gi-related (e.g. abdominal pain, nausea), consistent with the underlying disease condition and
the known mechanism of action of  xxxd3300xxx  (fig. 1)
[13].
treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 94 % of
 xxxd3300xxx  and 94 % of placebo recipients in study 004
[21] and in 83 and 79 % of patients, respectively, in study
020 [22]. the majority (&80 %) of treatment-emergent
adverse events were considered not to be related to treatment, and were of mild to moderate severity [14].
serious adverse events occurred in 37 % of  xxxd3300xxx 
and in 31 % of placebo recipients in study 004 [21] and in
36 and 28 % of patients, respectively, in study 020 [22]. in
study 004, haemorrhoidal bleeding (n = 1), coma (n = 1),
dysgeusia (n = 1) and hypersomnia (n = 1) were reported
as serious adverse events in  xxxd3300xxx  group, while
catheter sepsis (n = 1) was reported in the placebo group
[21]. in study 020, two serious adverse events (acute
cholecystitis and small intestinal stenosis) in the  xxxd3300xxx  group were deemed to be treatment-related [22].
withdrawal rates because of treatment-related adverse
events in  xxxd3300xxx  and placebo recipients were 17 and
6 %, respectively, in study 004; one event in a was judged
as serious the placebo recipient [21]. in study 020, the
respective rates of treatment withdrawal were 5 and 7 %;
no events were deemed as serious [22].
no deaths were reported during study 004 or 020 [21,
22]. however, one patient died from a bleeding ulcer
during the screening phase of study 004 [21].
non-neutralizing anti- xxxd3300xxx  antibodies were
detected in six patients who received  xxxd3300xxx  during
study 020 [22]. additionally, the anti- xxxd3300xxx  antibodies were cross-reactive to native glp-2 in five of the six
(83 %) patients who developed anti- xxxd3300xxx  antibodies
[13]. according to the spc, 30 % of patients developed
anti- xxxd3300xxx  antibodies and 40 % of patients developed

antibodies against e. coli protein during treatment with
 xxxd3300xxx  for up to 1 year [14]. there was no correlation
between presence of antibodies with short-term (up to
1.5 years) efficacy, tolerability or pharmacokinetic
parameters [13].
5.2 long-term tolerability
according to preliminary results of pooled data from the
placebo-controlled trials and their respective extension
studies (total n = 173), long-term treatment with  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day was generally well tolerated in
patients with sbs who were dependent on parenteral
support [32]. treatment-emergent adverse events were
reported in 95 % of patients in the  xxxd3300xxx  (0.05 or
0.10 mg/kg/day) groups [32]. serious adverse events and
adverse events leading to discontinuation were reported in
56 and 17 % of patients who had received  xxxd3300xxx  0.05
or 0.10 mg/kg/day, respectively [32]. abdominal pain
followed by gi stoma complications and nausea were the
most common adverse events leading to discontinuation
[32]. two deaths were reported during long-term therapy
with  xxxd3300xxx  [32].
the most commonly reported adverse events in  xxxd3300xxx  (0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day) recipients were gi-related
(abdominal pain, nausea) [32]. generally, adverse events
occurred early during therapy (e.g. during the first 6 months
of treatment) and their incidence decreased over time [32].
in study 021, the immunogenicity incidence rate
increased over time, with anti- xxxd3300xxx  antibodies being

detected in 27 % of  xxxd3300xxx  recipients at 12 months
and in 38 % of  xxxd3300xxx  recipients at 18 months [13].
5.3 adverse events of special interest
based on the pharmacologic activity and findings in animals,  xxxd3300xxx  has the potential to cause hyperplastic
changes, including small intestinal and/or colonic neoplasia
(see sect. 6 for recommendations) [13]. where reported
[21, 25], no dysplastic transformation was observed during
histopathological evaluation of the intestinal tissue samples
from patients participating in study 004. however, three
patients were diagnosed with malignancy during study 021
(steps-2), all of whom were male and had received
 xxxd3300xxx  in study 020 [29, 32]. one subject had a history
of abdominal radiation for hodgkin’s disease two decades
prior to receiving  xxxd3300xxx  and prior liver lesion on
computed tomography scan, and was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma of unconfirmed origin after
11 months of exposure to  xxxd3300xxx  [32]. two subjects
had extensive smoking histories, and were diagnosed with
lung cancers (non-small cell and squamous) after 3 and
12 months of  xxxd3300xxx  exposure, respectively [32].
overall, six patients were diagnosed with intestinal
polyps during the clinical trials [32]. of these patients, one
placebo recipient and one  xxxd3300xxx  recipient was diagnosed during the placebo-controlled trials (inflammatory
stomal and hyperplastic sigmoidal polyp after 3 and
5 months, respectively) [32]. four polyp cases were
reported in  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 or 0.10 mg/kg/day recipients

 xxxd3300xxx : a review

in the extension studies (two villous adenomas, one
hyperplastic polyp and one small duodenal polyp) [13, 32].
six  xxxd3300xxx  (0.05 or 10 mg/kg/day)-treated patients
during the placebo-controlled trials and six teduglutidetreated patients during the extension studies reported one or
more episodes of intestinal obstruction/stenosis [13, 32]. a
recurrence of obstruction was reported in two of the six
patients during the extension studies [32].
three patients who had received  xxxd3300xxx  during the
placebo-controlled trials were diagnosed with cholecystitis,
all of whom had a prior history of gallbladder disease [32].
no cases of cholecystitis were reported in the placebo
group [13]. there were reports of acute cholecystitis
(n = 3), new-onset cholelithiasis (n = 2) and cholestasis
secondary to an obstructed biliary stent (n = 1) with
 xxxd3300xxx  in the extension studies [32]. in  xxxd3300xxx 
recipients, one case of pancreatic pseudocyst was reported
during the placebo-controlled trials and one case each of
chronic pancreatitis and acute pancreatitis was reported
during the extension studies [32].
fluid overload occurred in 9 of 77  xxxd3300xxx -treated
patients (12 %) during the placebo-controlled trials. of
these, two cases were in patients with congestive heart
failure (one serious) [32].
during the placebo-controlled trials, one patient, who
was also receiving the benzodiazepine  xxxd2999xxx , experienced dramatic deterioration in mental status progressing
to coma during her first week of  xxxd3300xxx  treatment [32].
her benzodiazepine level was found to be [300 lg/l. she
recovered following withdrawal of  xxxd3300xxx  and  xxxd2999xxx  [32]. see sect. 2.5 for details of potential drug interactions and recommendations.

6 dosage and administration
in adult patients with sbs who are dependent on parenteral
support, the recommended dosage of  xxxd3300xxx  is
0.05 mg per kg of bodyweight, administered once daily via
subcutaneous injection [13, 14].  xxxd3300xxx  injection site
should be alternated between one of the four abdominal
quadrants, and in some cases the thigh can also be used
(e.g. when use of the abdomen is hampered by pain,
scarring or hardening of the tissue) [13, 14].
in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment
and in those with end-stage renal disease, it is recommended that the  xxxd3300xxx  dosage be reduced by 50 %
(see sect. 3) [13, 14]. no dosage adjustment is necessary
for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment
[13, 14].
due to the risk of neoplastic growth associated with
 xxxd3300xxx  (see also sect. 5.3), a colonoscopy of the entire
colon with removal of polyps should be conducted prior to

945

initiating therapy and also recommended after one year of
treatment [13, 14]. subsequent colonoscopies should be
conducted as needed, but no less frequently than every five
years. in patients at increased risk for malignancy, the
clinical decision to use  xxxd3300xxx  should be considered
only if the benefits outweigh the risks.  xxxd3300xxx  therapy
should be discontinued in patients with active gastrointestinal malignancy (gi tract, hepatobiliary, pancreatic). in
patients with active non-gastrointestinal malignancy, the
clinical decision to continue  xxxd3300xxx  should be made
based on benefit:risk considerations [13, 14].
local manufacturer’s prescribing information should be
consulted for further information on treatment regimens,
warnings, precautions, and contraindications, as well as the
use of  xxxd3300xxx  in special patient populations.

7 current status of  xxxd3300xxx  in short bowel
syndrome
 xxxd3300xxx  is approved in the usa [13] and eu [14] for
the treatment of adult patients with sbs who are dependent
on parenteral support.
in the pivotal phase iii, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 020 (steps), subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg given once daily was effective in the
treatment of patients with sbs who required parenteral
support as assessed by responder rates (primary endpoint)
(sect. 4.2). a benefit of therapy (as assessed by a graded
response score) was also observed with the 0.05 mg/kg/day
dosage of  xxxd3300xxx  in the similarly designed study 004
(sect 4.1). however, no statistically significant difference
was observed between  xxxd3300xxx  0.10 mg/kg/day recipients and placebo recipients in this study.
subcutaneous  xxxd3300xxx  0.05 mg/kg/day had an
acceptable tolerability profile (sect. 5); the most frequently
reported adverse events were generally of gi origin (e.g.
abdominal pain, nausea), consistent with the underlying
disease condition and the known mechanism of action of
 xxxd3300xxx . adverse events of special interest were
malignancy; colorectal polyps; gi stenosis/obstruction;
gallbladder, biliary, and pancreatic disease; fluid overload;
and increased risk of absorption of concomitant oral
medications.
the long-term efficacy and tolerability of  xxxd3300xxx  in
patients with sbs is currently being investigated in study
021 (steps-2) an 2-year open-label extension of study
020, with preliminary interim results suggesting that
 xxxd3300xxx  recipients experience additional clinically
meaningful reductions in parenteral support during longterm treatment (sect. 4.3.2). furthermore, complete independence from parenteral support was achieved in 12
patients, between 28 and 114 weeks after starting

946

 xxxd3300xxx , in the extension study. the tolerability profile
of  xxxd3300xxx  during long-term treatment was similar to
what was similar to that observed during short-term treatment. generally, adverse events occurred early (i.e. during
the first 6 months of treatment) and the incidence
decreased over time. an extension trial of study 021 [33]
and a planned sbs registry (follow-up of 10 years) [34]
will provide further information on the long-term efficacy
and tolerability of  xxxd3300xxx . additionally, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (rems) is in place to ensure
that the benefits of  xxxd3300xxx  outweigh the risk [35].
there are no published guidelines regarding the recommended approach for weaning a patient off parental
support. however, an article by seidner et al. [7] discusses
the clinical considerations and best practice recommendations for intestinal rehabilitation, focusing on: optimization
of fluids, electrolytes and nutrients; integration of  xxxd3300xxx  therapy; and approaches to parenteral nutrition and
fluid weaning.
although demographics and disease characteristics
varied widely among the completely weaned patients in
study 021, most patients had lower baseline parenteral
support requirements (i.e.\7 l/week).  xxxd3300xxx  may be
of most benefit in patients who are borderline between
being dependent or independent of parenteral support and it
appears likely that these patients will be the ones who are
able to completely discontinue parenteral support during
 xxxd3300xxx  therapy [36]. however, it has been suggested
that even one night free from parenteral support has the
potential to improve qol for many patients [36].
further clinical trials investigating the optimal timing of
 xxxd3300xxx  treatment following onset of sbs and the
effects on patients after the discontinuation of  xxxd3300xxx 
would be beneficial. in the meantime, the acceptable benefit: risk ratio of  xxxd3300xxx  in study 020 combined with
the limited treatment options and seriousness of the condition make  xxxd3300xxx  a welcome addition for the management of sbs.
