the nonsteroidal antiandrogen  xxxd2725xxx  (anandronr) weakly interacts with the prostatic
cytosolic  xxxg183xxx  and shows a fast dissociation rate. when administered to
immature castrated rats up to the daily dose of 100 mg/kg, it is devoid of any androgenic
activity but efficiently blocks the growth-promoting activity of androgens on ventral prostate
and seminal vesicle weight, thus showing the characteristics of a pure antiandrogen. in
intact animals, on the other hand, the antiandrogen administered alone exerts only a partial
inhibition of prostate and seminal vesicle weight. this is due to the property of the pure
antiandrogen to neutralize the inhibitory feedback effect of androgens at the pituitary level
on the lh responsiveness to  xxxg930xxx , as illustrated in vitro in rat anterior pituitary cells in
culture as well as in vivo in intact and castrated animals. in intact animals, neutralization of
the inhibitory feedback action of endogenous androgens leads to an increased lh and
testosterone secretion, which partly overcomes the direct action of the antiandrogen at the
level of the prostate and seminal vesicles. in fact, the plasma testosterone concentration is
more than doubled 6 hr after the administration of 10 rng of  xxxd2725xxx  while plasma lh
and testosterone levels are increased by 7- and 17-fold, respectively, after 14 days of similar
daily treatment. efficient neutralization of the androgenic action at the prostatic level in
intact animals thus requires prevention of this escape phenomenon through inhibition of lh
secretion. although inhibition of lh release can be achieved by estrogen and progestins,
an optimal inhibitory effect on the prostate is obtained by the combined administration of
the antiandrogen with an  xxxg930xxx  agonist that causes a specific blockage of testicular
androgen biosynthesis as well as an inhibition of the lh responsiveness to  xxxg930xxx .

introduction

for more than two decades, the chemists of roussel uclaf have synthesized
a large number of steroids [ 1,2] as well as nonsteroidal compounds with the aim of
developing more active and specific hormones and antihormones. the extensive use
of in vitro binding screening tests coupled with in vivo biological assays has permitted
the selection of promising compounds and the achievement of rapid development in
this area [3,4]. binding measurements after different times and temperatures of

ventral prostate from adult male rats (sprague-dawley, 200 gm castrated for 24 hr) and was incubated
for different time intervals either with 5 nm 13h] xxxd2631xxx  at 15°c or with 2.5 nm 13h] xxxd2631xxx  at 0°c
in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of radioinert  xxxd2631xxx , testosterone, or ru
23908. the rba of  xxxd2725xxx  was determined by a dextran-coated charcoal adsorption technique as
previously described [4].the rbas of  xxxd2631xxx  at 15°c and testosterone at 0°c were taken as 100.

incubation have enabled assessment of the stability of the receptor-ligand complex
[5,6] and of the structural requirements necessary for an optimal fit between the
ligand and the receptor sites of several classes of steroid hormones [7,8].
as part of this screening program, new tags for the various receptors have been
selected and have provided useful tools for the detection and specific measurement of
hormone receptors in normal or pathological tissues [9]. as an example, the availability of tritiated  xxxd2631xxx  [lo] has largely contributed to a better understanding of
the molecular basis of androgen action, thus, leading to new concepts for the treatment
of androgen-dependent pathologies.
antiandrogens have been available for many years, but so far their usefulness
in the management of prostatic cancer has not been clearly demonstrated. following

the original observations of huggins and hodges [ill, surgical castration and high
doses of estrogens have been the therapies of choice in this disease. estrogens and
some progestins (essentially androstane derivatives) block lh secretion and thus
inhibit androgen production by the testis, but do not prevent the action of androgens
of adrenal origin on the prostate cancer. in addition, treatment with high doses of
estrogens is accompanied by serious cardiovascular complications [121.
in castrated animals, antiandrogens acting at the receptor level have proved to
be very effective in neutralizing the action of exogenous androgens [13-151. our
initial approach [16] was to assess the activity of analogues of cyproterone and of

2956 because of inherent anohogenicity [17], and focused on the nonsteroidal antiandrogens. a large series of such derivatives were synthesized [18] and assayed in
various tests. the criteria for selection were: high antiandrogenic potency, complete
lack of androgenicity, inability to induce methemoglobinemia in animal models and
lack of interference with other hormonal receptor sites. the final choice was ru
23908 (anandronr), a “pure” antiandrogen (fig. 1) [18,19]. this compound offers
the possibility of studying the effect of complete androgen neutralization and is a
component of a new combined hormonal approach for the treatment of prostate cancer

testosterone up to 15 min of incubation at 15°c (fig. 2). during longer times of
incubation, the rba of  xxxd2725xxx  decreases to even lower values. these data indicate
that  xxxd2725xxx  interacts transiently and/or incompletely with the  xxxg183xxx ,
thus forming a short-lived complex, which, as shown later, is unable to induce an
androgenic response. in addition, the compound can block the access of active
androgens to the cytosolic receptor site.

up to a relatively high daily dose (100 mg/kg),  xxxd2725xxx  is devoid of any

the increase in prostate and seminal vesicle weight induced by a 7-day treatment with
 xxxd3327xxx , whether administered subcutaneously (fig. 4)or orally (data

fig. 13. effect of a 5-month combined treatment ( xxxd2725xxx  and  xxxd387xxx ) on prostate and seminal
vesicle weights in intact adult male rats. adult male rats (sprague-dawley, 230-250 grn) were injected
sc daily for 5 months with solvent (1 % gelatin in saline) (control rats), 5 mgiratlday of  xxxd2725xxx , 250
ng/rat/day of  xxxd387xxx , or the combination of both drugs. ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weights
were determined 24 hr after the last injection (means k sem) 1271.

in the intact adult male rat, on the other hand,  xxxd2725xxx  alone only partially
inhibits the trophic effect of endogenous androgens on prostate and seminal vesicle
weight (fig. 5 ) . up to the daily dose of 10 mg per rat, the weight of the prostate and
seminal vesicles is never decreased by more than 50% when the antiandrogen is
administered alone.
suppression by  xxxd2725xxx  of the negative feedback action of androgens at
the pituitary level
as shown in anterior pituitary cells in primary culture (fig. 6),  xxxd2725xxx 
reverses the inhibitory effect of androgens on  xxxg930xxx -induced lh release [191.
m  xxxd2725xxx  causes a 70% reversal of the effect of 0.3 nm dihydrotestosterone. in
vivo, repeated administration of  xxxd2725xxx  partially reverses the decreased plasma
lh response to  xxxg930xxx  injection induced by dihydrotestosterone administration in the
castrated rat (fig. 7a) or by endogenous androgens in the intact adult male animal
(fig. 7b). the plasma lh concentration achieved after  xxxg930xxx  administration in intact
animals treated with the antiandrogen is up to four times above that observed in intact
controls [ 191.
as a result of its action at the hypothalamo-pituitary level, the plasma concentration of testosterone is rapidly increased in intact male rats after administration of
 xxxd2725xxx . thus, after a single injection of 10 mg of  xxxd2725xxx  per rat, the plasma
testosterone level is more than doubled, as early as 6 hr after treatment, and remains
nearly constant up to 24 hr (fig. 8). after a 14-day administration of different doses
of  xxxd2725xxx , the plasma lh and testosterone concentrations are increased in a dose-

308

raynaud et a1

dependent manner. thus, at a daily dose of 10 mg/rat, a 17-fold increase in testosterone levels is observed (fig. 9) [19].
blockage of the escape phenomenon by pituitary inhibition of lh secretion

to prevent the rise in testosterone secretion observed in intact animals treated
with  xxxd2725xxx , which almost completely neutralizes the antiandrogenic effect of ru
23908 at the prostatic level, we have analyzed the activity of two types of pituitary
inhibitors that can be administered concomitantly with the antiandrogen, namely,
steroids and  xxxg930xxx  agonists.
the association of  xxxd2725xxx  (10 mg/rat/day for 4 days) with ru 16117, a
partial estrogen agonist with antagonistic activity [22], is able to suppress the plasma
lh response to  xxxg930xxx  in the rat (data not shown) and leads to a 67% inhibition in
prostatic weight (as compared to 50% with  xxxd2725xxx  alone) (fig. 9). this effect on
prostatic weight is obtained at a dose (33 pg/rat/day) that suppresses the increase in
plasma lh and testosterone concentrations induced by  xxxd2725xxx  alone by approximately 90% (fig. 10).
similarly, the association of  xxxd2725xxx  with a potent progestin, r 5020 [23], at
a dose (100 pg/rat/day) that suppresses the  xxxd2725xxx -induced increase in plasma
testosterone (fig. lo), leads to a more complete antiandrogenic response on
the prostate (82% decrease as compared to 50% decrease with  xxxd2725xxx  alone)
(fig. 9).
a discovery of major importance in the field of hormone-dependent diseases is
the somewhat unexpected finding that treatment of adult male rats with  xxxg930xxx 
agonists desensitizes the lh response in leydig cells and causes a marked inhibition
of testosterone formation with parallel inhibitory effects on secondary sex organ
weight (fig. 11) 124,251. the concomitant treatment of adult male rats with ru
23908 (5 mg/rat/day) and a potent  xxxg930xxx  agonist,  xxxd387xxx  (250 ng/rat/day),
considerably increases the antiandrogenic effect of  xxxd2725xxx  on the weights of the
prostate and seminal vesicles. thus, after a 14-day (fig. 12) [26] and also after a 5month (fig. 13) [27] combined treatment, the prostate and seminal vesicle weights
are reduced to values comparable to those achieved by castration.
discussion

the present data clearly indicate that complete neutralization of the trophic
effect of endogenous androgens on the prostate cannot be achieved by the use of a
pure antiandrogen alone, which competes for androgen binding at the receptor sites
in all target tissues. since the testicular secretion of androgens is mainly under the
control of luteinizing hormone, which, in turn, is regulated by the concentration of
circulating androgens, the general blockage of androgen action by the antiandrogen
prevents the action of androgens not only in the prostate, but also in the anterior
pituitary gland and hypothalamus where androgens inhibit lh and  xxxg930xxx  release.
prevention by the antiandrogen of the negative feedback action of endogenous androgens causes a progressive increase in lh and testosterone secretion, which can
ultimately completely neutralize the effect of the antiandrogen at the prostatic level.
this is well illustrated by the absence or minimal effect on prostate and seminal
vesicle weight, respectively, of daily treatment for 5 months of adult male rats with 5
mg of  xxxd2725xxx  alone [27] (fig. 13).

combination of antiandrogen and  xxxg930xxx  agonist

309

as mentioned earlier, in addition to surgical castration, various means of
reducing testosterone secretion are available. traditionally, estrogens and progestins
having no or some androgenic activity have been used as pituitary inhibitors, but the
recent observation of the potent and specific down-regulation achieved by  xxxg930xxx 
agonists opened a new way to achieve chemical and reversible castration [24,25].
fortunately, man is the most sensitive among all species studied so far to the inhibitory
effect of  xxxg930xxx  agonists on testicular androgen formation and medical castration can
thus be easily achieved with no side effects other than those related to low androgen
levels [20,28]. however, the use of  xxxg930xxx  agonists does not eliminate the need for
antiandrogens due to the presence of other sources of androgens, particularly the
adrenals, that secrete androgen precursors at significant concentration after inhibition
of testicular androgen biosynthesis [29].
the choice of the antiandrogen is not easily achieved. weak agonists can exert
a trophic action on the prostate, which makes difficult the choice of the optimal
balance between doses having agonistic and antagonistic activities. this disadvantage
is eliminated by the use of a pure antiandrogen such as  xxxd2725xxx . in addition, it is
of great interest that the antiandrogen exerts synergistic effects with the  xxxg930xxx 
agonist, thus increasing the individual efficiency of each compound and decreasing
the doses required for both drugs.
the requirement for the antiandrogen is also supported by the need to neutralize
the increased plasma testosterone levels, which are always observed during the first
5 to 15 days of treatment with  xxxg930xxx  agonists [20,28,30]. it, thus, seems reasonable
to suggest that  xxxg930xxx  agonists, which are wonderful chemical tools to induce a
reversible castration, should always be administered in combination with an antiandrogen in order to neutralize the effect of the initial rise in androgen secretion on
androgen-sensitive tumor cells. following this initial period of approximately 2
weeks, the antiandrogen will neutralize the influence of androgens of adrenal origin.
since it is most likely that these antiandrogens will have to be given for long
periods of time for the treatment of prostatic cancer, they should be well tolerated.
following the considerations mentioned above, the desirable antiandrogenic molecule
must be devoid of any agonistic hormonal effect and should not induce methemoglobinemia, and its structure should be stable enough to remain in its active
form in the circulation for long periods of time. this last point is important in order
to achieve a constant supply of the competitor at the receptor site in the prostatic
tumor. as confirmed by preliminary pharmacokinetic studies,  xxxd2725xxx  possesses
these favorable features.
