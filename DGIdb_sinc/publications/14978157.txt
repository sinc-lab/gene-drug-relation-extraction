abstract. adrenalectomy in rats is associated with urinary
concentrating and diluting defects. this study tested the effect
of adrenal steroids on the ut-a1 urea transporter because it is
involved in the urine-concentrating mechanism. rats were
adrenalectomized and given normal saline for 14 d, after which
they received (1) vehicle, (2) aldosterone, or (3) spironolactone
plus aldosterone. adrenalectomy alone significantly increased
ut-a1 protein in the inner medullary tip after 7 d, whereas
aldosterone repletion reversed the effect. spironolactone
blocked the aldosterone-induced decrease in ut-a1, indicating
that aldosterone was working via the  xxxg1602xxx . for verifying that glucocorticoids downregulate ut-a1
protein through a different receptor, three groups of adrenalec-

tomized rats were prepared: (1) vehicle, (2) adrenalectomy plus
dexamethasone, and (3) adrenalectomy plus dexamethasone
and spironolactone. dexamethasone significantly reversed
ut-a1 protein abundance increase in the inner medullary tip
of adrenalectomized rats. when spironolactone was given with
dexamethasone, it did not affect the dexamethasone-induced
decrease in ut-a1. there was no significant change in serum
vasopressin level, aquaporin 2, or na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺ co-transporter  xxxg2078xxx / xxxg2078xxx  protein abundances or ut-a1 mrna
abundance in any of the groups. in conclusion, either mineralocorticoids or glucocorticoids can downregulate ut-a1 protein. the decrease in ut-a1 does not require both steroid
hormones, and each works through a different receptor.

adrenalectomy reduces urine-concentrating ability (1–3) but
also inhibits acute water diuresis (4). both glucocorticoids and
mineralocorticoids must be administered to reverse the inhibition of acute water diuresis (4). valtin and colleagues (4)
showed that giving aldosterone to adrenalectomized rats after
an acute water load corrected their diluting ability, whereas
prednisolone corrected urine flow. these findings suggest that
both adrenal steroids are involved in the regulation of urinary
concentration and dilution.
urea plays an important role in the urine-concentrating
mechanism (reviewed in (5)). we previously studied the effect
of glucocorticoids (dexamethasone) on ut-a1 protein abundance in adrenalectomized rats. we showed that glucocorticoids decrease the protein abundance of the ut-a1 urea transporter in the inner medullary tip of adrenalectomized rats (6)
and in conditions associated with excess glucocorticoid, such
as uncontrolled diabetes (7, 8). presumably, in catabolic states
in which glucocorticoid levels are increased, ut-a1 is downregulated to permit more nitrogenous waste to be excreted into
the urine and to prevent excessive reabsorption of urea across
the terminal inner medullary collecting duct (imcd).

the effect of mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) on ut-a1
protein abundance in adrenalectomized rats has not been studied. ohara et al. (9) studied mineralocorticoid deficiency,
induced by adrenalectomy with glucocorticoid replacement,
and showed that it had no effect on ut-a1 protein abundance,
regardless of whether the rats were given normal saline or plain
water to drink. however, the presence of glucocorticoids may
have altered any effect that would have resulted from mineralocorticoids alone. we showed that ut-a1 mrna levels do
not differ between adrenalectomized rats, sham-operated rats,
or adrenalectomized rats given glucocorticoids (6). therefore,
the goal of this study was to determine whether mineralocorticoids alone have an effect on ut-a1 protein or mrna
abundance by administering aldosterone to adrenalectomized
rats.

materials and methods
animal preparation
all animal protocols were approved by the emory university
institutional animal care and use committee. pathogen-free male
sprague-dawley rats (100 to 150 g; charles river labs, wilmington,
ma) were kept in cages with autoclaved bedding and received free
access to water and a standard diet (diet 5001; purina). rats were
adrenalectomized as described previously (6), then allowed to recover
for 14 d. all adrenalectomized rats were given 0.9% normal saline to
drink. after 14 d, osmotic minipumps (alzet, palo alto, ca) were
implanted with aldosterone at varying concentrations and for different
durations (see the results section). aldosterone (2 mg) was dissolved
in 100 fl of dmso and diluted with 1.9 ml of normal saline. a total
of 200 fl was loaded into each minipump. control animals received
minipumps that contained vehicle (dmso) only. the dmso level did

j am soc nephrol 15: 558–565, 2004

not exceed 10%, and, when possible, 1% dmso was used. spironolactone (100 mg) was suspended in 1 ml of olive oil. rats received a
subcutaneous injection of 200 ␮l of spironolactone per day for 8 d.
another group of rats underwent adrenalectomy and received subcutaneous dexamethasone for 7 d at a dose (20 ␮g/d) designed to
approximate a high physiologic glucocorticoid level (10). some of
these rats also received spironolactone as described above.
rats were killed, at which time blood and urine were collected for
plasma aldosterone, corticosterone, vasopressin, and urine osmolality
(model 5500 vapor pressure osmometer; wescor, logan, ut). plasma
aldosterone and corticosterone levels were determined by ria (coata-count aldosterone; dpc, los angeles, ca). plasma vasopressin
levels were determined by eia (assay designs, inc., ann arbor, mi).

sample preparation
renal medulla was dissected into outer medulla, inner medullary
base, and inner medullary tip as described previously (6). these
tissues were placed into an ice-cold isolation buffer (triethanolamine
10 mm, sucrose 250 mm [ph 7.6], leupeptin 1 ␮g/ml, and pmsf 2
mg/ml), homogenized, and sheared with a 25-g needle, and sds was
added to a final concentration of 1%. total protein in each sample was
measured by a modified lowry assay (dc protein assay kit; biorad, richmond, ca).

western blot analysis
proteins (10 ␮g/lane) were size separated by sds-page using 10
or 15% polyacrylamide gels. proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes (gelman scientific, ann arbor, mi). next,
blots were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with blocking
buffer: 5% nonfat dry milk suspended in tris-buffered saline (tbs;
20 mm tris hcl, 0.5 m nacl [ph 7.5]), then with primary antibody
overnight at 4°c (6). primary antibodies included our polyclonal
antibodies to ut-a1, aquaporin 2 (aqp2), and the na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺
co-transporter  xxxg2078xxx / xxxg2078xxx  and a commercial antibody to 11-␤
hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type ii (11-␤  xxxg1085xxx ; chemicon, temecula, ca). blots were washed three times in tbs with 0.5%
tween-20 (tbs/tween), then incubated with either horseradish peroxidase–linked goat anti-rabbit igg (amersham, arlington heights,
il) or goat anti-rabbit igg linked to alexa 680 fluorescent dye
(molecular probes, eugene, or) for 2 h at room temperature. blots
were washed twice with tbs/tween, then the bound secondary antibody was visualized using either chemiluminescence (horseradish
peroxidase–linked secondary antibody, ecl kit; amersham) or infrared laser detection (alexa-linked secondary antibody; licor odyssey gel scanning system, lincoln, ne). laser densitometry was used
to quantify the intensity of the resulting bands. results are expressed
as arbitrary units/␮g protein loaded. in all cases, parallel gels were
stained with coomassie blue and showed uniformity of loading (data
not shown).

northern blot analysis
tissue samples were homogenized in 500 ␮l of trizol reagent
(invitrogen life technologies, carlsbad, ca). rna was isolated
using 200 ␮l of chloroform/1 ml trizol. the samples were centrifuged, and the pellet was dissolved with diethyl pyrocarbonate water.
the rna concentration was measured with genequant spectrophotometry (pharmacia biotech, cambridge, england). one percent agarose gels were prepared by adding 1.5 g of agarose to 150 ml of
northern running buffer (ambion, austin, tx). the gels were poured
into a horizontal gel electrophoresis system (life technologies, grand
island, ny) and immersed in running buffer (ambion). rna was

prepared by placing 5 ␮g of sample in a tube with the corresponding
amount of glyoxal load dye (ambion). samples were incubated for 30
min in a 50°c water bath and loaded onto the gel. the gel was run at
90 volts for approximately 3 h, then transferred to a blot transfer
system (life technologies, gaithersburg, md) and allowed to soak
overnight to allow transfer of the mrna to a nylon transfer membrane. ultrahyb solution (ambion) was preheated to 65°c, and the
blotted membranes were soaked in water in a hybridization tube. tris
chloride (20 nm) was added to the bottles that contained the membrane. the membrane was rotated in a hybridization oven for 10 min.
ten milliliters of ultrahyb and 200 ␮g of fish dna were added to the
tubes. the tubes were prehybridized for 2 h in a preheated roller oven.
a 32p-labeled cdna probe to ut-a1 (11) was created using a
megaprime dna labeling protocol from amersham (buckinghamshire, uk). the cdna probe was denatured at 100°c for 5 min, then
25 ␮l of probe was added to the membrane and it was hybridized
overnight in a 65°c roller. the membranes were washed two times
with ssc and 0.1% sds and two times with 0.1 ssc and 0.1% sds.
the membranes were exposed at ⫺80°c for 24 h.

statistical analyses
all data are presented as mean ⫾ sem, and n ⫽ number of rats. to
test for statistical significance, an anova was used, followed by
tukey protected t test (12) to determine which groups were significantly different. the criterion for statistical significance was p ⬍

results
effect of adrenalectomy on ut-a1
to ensure that any residual effect of adrenal steroid hormones had worn off, we determined the time course of response for ut-a1 after adrenalectomy. in the inner medullary
tip, ut-a1 protein is typically detected as 97- and 117-kd
bands; both bands represent glycosylated forms of ut-a1 (13).
there was no significant change in ut-a1 protein abundance
in the inner medullary tip at 3 or 5 d after adrenalectomy
(figure 1). however, ut-a1 protein abundance was significantly increased  xxxd2274xxx  and 14 d after adrenalectomy. in contrast,
both plasma mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) and glucocorticoids (corticosterone) are reduced to background level within
3 d of adrenalectomy (figure 2). all subsequent experiments
used rats at 14 d after adrenalectomy.

mineralocorticoid effects on ut-a1
aldosterone administration to adrenalectomized rats significantly reduced ut-a1 protein abundance in the inner medullary tip at 3 to 5 d but not at 2 d (figure 3). in contrast, ut-a1
protein abundance in the inner medullary base was not affected
by aldosterone (figure 3).
spironolactone was used to test whether the decrease in
ut-a1 protein by aldosterone was through interaction with the
 xxxg1602xxx . urine osmolality was significantly
higher in the adrenalectomy plus aldosterone rats than in the
adrenalectomy alone or adrenalectomy plus aldosterone plus
spironolactone rats (figure 4a). the plasma aldosterone levels
in the two groups of rats that received aldosterone were significantly higher than in the adrenalectomy alone rats but were
not significantly different from each other (figure 4b). there

aldosterone-induced decrease in ut-a1 protein. there were no

significant differences in aqp2 (figure 5) or  xxxg2078xxx / xxxg2078xxx 
(figure 6) protein abundances between any of the groups.
administering aldosterone to adrenalectomized rats significantly decreased ut-a1 protein abundance by 78%, compared
with adrenalectomy alone (figure 7). ut-a1 protein abundance was significantly increased in the adrenalectomized rats

in the absence of 11-␤  xxxg1085xxx , glucocorticoids can act
through the  xxxg1602xxx . our previous study
showed that ut-a1 protein abundance is reduced by glucocorticoids (6). therefore, we measured 11-␤  xxxg1085xxx  protein levels
in rats that underwent sham operation, adrenalectomy alone,
and adrenalectomy plus aldosterone. the 11-␤  xxxg1085xxx  protein
was present in all regions of the kidney but in varying abundance. however, adrenalectomy did not alter 11-␤  xxxg1085xxx  protein abundance in any region of the kidney (figure 9).
to verify that glucocorticoids were not decreasing ut-a1
protein abundance through the  xxxg1602xxx , we
determined the effect of administering dexamethasone to adrenalectomized rats, in both the presence and absence of spironolactone. administering dexamethasone to adrenalectomized
rats significantly decreased ut-a1 protein abundance, compared with adrenalectomy alone, consistent with our previous
study (6). however, spironolactone did not block the dexamethasone-induced decrease in ut-a1 protein (figure 10).
there were no significant differences in ut-a1 mrna abundance between any of the groups (figure 8c).

discussion
the major finding in this study is that aldosterone decreases
ut-a1 protein abundance in the inner medullary tip of adrenalectomized rats. aldosterone exerts its effect through the
 xxxg1602xxx . glucocorticoids also decrease
ut-a1 protein abundance in the inner medullary tip of adrenalectomized rats ((6) and the present study) but not by interacting with the  xxxg1602xxx . presumably, glucocorticoids exert their effect through the glucocorticoid
receptor. neither aldosterone nor glucocorticoids alter ut-a1
protein abundance in the inner medullary base of adrenalectomized rats ((6) and the present study). the terminal imcd,
located in the inner medullary tip, contains a unique cell type,

the imcd cell, which is not present in other portions of the
collecting duct (14, 15). this suggests that the imcd may be
unique in its response to adrenal steroids, at least in terms of
their effect on ut-a1 protein abundance.
although plasma aldosterone and corticosterone levels were
depleted at 2 to 3 d after adrenalectomy, ut-a1 abundance did
not change until 7 d after adrenalectomy. this finding suggests
that the half-life of ut-a1 protein is days and/or that the
biologic half-life of adrenal steroids is considerably longer than
their half-life in plasma. regardless of the mechanism, the
present finding emphasizes the need to allow sufficient time
after adrenalectomy for the pre-adrenalectomy level of ut-a1 to
reach its new value before making experimental manipulations.
we found no change in ut-a1 mrna abundance between
adrenalectomy and either mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid
replacement. the lack of change with glucocorticoids is consistent with our previous study (6). these findings suggest that
the change in ut-a1 protein abundance occurs by a posttranscriptional mechanism.

lular concentrations of glucocorticoids are high enough to act
at the  xxxg1602xxx . fenton et al. (16) recently
showed that dahl salt–sensitive rats have a marked increase in
ut-a1 protein abundance and 11-␤  xxxg1085xxx  activity compared
with control rats. because glucocorticoids decrease ut-a1
transcription (17) and the increase in 11-␤  xxxg1085xxx  activity will
decrease the intracellular glucocorticoid level, the increase in
ut-a1 protein in the dahl salt–sensitive rat may result from a
decrease in glucocorticoid-mediated repression of ut-a1 transcription (16). wang et al. (18) showed that aldosteroneinduced extracellular volume expansion results in a decrease in
ut-a1 protein abundance. in the present study, if adrenalectomy had resulted in a reduction of 11-␤  xxxg1085xxx  protein, then
glucocorticoid administration could have reduced ut-a1 protein through the  xxxg1602xxx . however, we
found no change in 11-␤  xxxg1085xxx  protein after adrenalectomy.
more important, we found no change in ut-a1 protein abundance when rats were given both glucocorticoids and spironolactone, compared with glucocorticoids alone. thus, glucocorticoids are acting through a distinct mechanism that is
unrelated to the  xxxg1602xxx , most likely
through the  xxxg1601xxx .

the present study cannot distinguish between a direct effect
of aldosterone on ut-a1 versus a response to some other
change that occurs after adrenalectomy and/or aldosterone
administration. one mechanism to consider is a change in
serum vasopressin levels, because administering vasopressin to
brattleboro rats for 5 d decreases ut-a1 protein abundance
(19). however, we found no significant difference in vasopressin levels. measuring vasopressin levels in rats can be problematic because any factor that causes the rat to become
anxious can result in a large and rapid release of vasopressin
from the posterior pituitary. therefore, we also measured the
protein abundance of aqp2 and  xxxg2078xxx / xxxg2078xxx , two proteins
whose abundances are increased by vasopressin (20, 21), but
we found no significant difference in either aqp2 or  xxxg2078xxx /
 xxxg2078xxx  protein abundance. therefore, it seems that changes in
vasopressin levels did not contribute to the aldosterone-induced decrease in ut-a1 protein abundance.
in the present study, all adrenalectomized rats drank normal
saline to maintain effective circulating volume in the absence
of any adrenal steroids. ohara et al. (9) compared glucocorticoid-replaced adrenalectomized rats that were given normal
saline versus water to vary their volume status but found no
change in ut-a1 protein between rats that were given saline
versus water. ohara et al. also showed that the mineralocorticoid-deficient rats that were given water had a significant
increase in  xxxg2078xxx / xxxg2078xxx , but when the same rats were given
normal saline in an effort to preserve intravascular volume,
there was no change in  xxxg2078xxx / xxxg2078xxx  abundance (9). in the

possible physiologic role of aldosterone’s effect
on ut-a1
ut-a1 protein is upregulated in several conditions in which
rats cannot maximally concentrate their urine (reviewed in
(22)). in the present study, adrenalectomy decreased urine
osmolality, and aldosterone administration increased it. ut-a1
protein abundance in the inner medullary tip increased when
the concentrating defect was present and decreased when the
defect was corrected with aldosterone. administering either
dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid, or aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid, corrected the adrenalectomy-induced concentrating
defect and decreased ut-a1 protein abundance. these results
indicate that both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids participate in the regulation of ut-a1 and that replacing either
adrenal steroid is sufficient to reduce ut-a1 protein abundance to the level found in sham-operated rats.
mineralocorticoid levels are typically elevated in situations
in which an animal or a person would be required to preserve
intravascular volume. in the present experiment, however,
mineralocorticoids decreased the abundance of ut-a1, which
would not facilitate the preservation of vascular volume. thus,
the decrease in ut-a1 may seem to be opposite to what one
would have predicted. however, in the present study, we
created a urine-concentrating defect without hypovolemia by
adrenalectomy and giving the rats normal saline to drink, and
this increased ut-a1, consistent with previous studies in

564

journal of the american society of nephrology

which a urine-concentrating defect was created (reviewed in
(22)); mineralocorticoid repletion reversed the urine-concentrating defect and the increase in ut-a1.
both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids play an important role in maintaining vascular stability in patients. indeed,
patients with adrenal insufficiency are frequently hypotensive,
and aldosterone is an important contributor to the maintenance
of effective circulating volume. upregulation of ut-a1 in
adrenal insufficiency would tend to blunt the tendency for
hemodynamic instability by creating a hypertonic inner medullary interstitium that promotes water reabsorption. we recently showed that ut-a1 protein is upregulated in rats with
uncontrolled diabetes  xxxd1891xxx  to 20 d after  xxxd3249xxx  injection (8). we suggested that this upregulation is part of a
compensatory response to limit the loss of solute and water
despite the ongoing osmotic diuresis (8). during the opposite
physiologic condition, aldosterone-induced volume expansion,
wang et al. (18) showed that ut-a1 protein abundance is
decreased. thus, ut-a1 may be upregulated during adrenal
insufficiency as part of a compensatory response to limit the
loss of solute and water.
our experiments may provide some insight into the findings
that valtin and colleagues made ⬎3 decades ago (4). they
concluded that aldosterone corrected the diluting ability of
adrenalectomized rats (4). downregulation of ut-a1 would
tend to decrease the urea concentration in the inner medulla,
thereby decreasing the ability to reabsorb water. in turn, this
would contribute to the production of dilute urine.

conclusion
adrenalectomy reduces urine-concentrating ability (1–3)
and also inhibits acute water diuresis (4). in part, adrenalectomized rats adapt by increasing ut-a1 protein abundance in the
inner medullary tip. this adaptation is fairly specific, because
neither aqp2 nor  xxxg2078xxx / xxxg2078xxx  protein abundances are altered. in addition, the regulation occurs via a posttranscriptional mechanism because ut-a1 mrna levels did not
change. when adrenalectomized rats are given back either
aldosterone or dexamethasone, ut-a1 protein returns to the
level found in sham-operated control rats. the effect of aldosterone on ut-a1 protein is blocked by a mineralocorticoid
antagonist. however, the effect of dexamethasone on ut-a1
protein is not blocked by a mineralocorticoid antagonist. we
conclude that either aldosterone or dexamethasone alone is
sufficient to reverse the changes in urine osmolality and
ut-a1 protein abundance caused by adrenalectomy, but mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids act through distinct
receptors.
