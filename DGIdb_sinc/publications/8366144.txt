abstract
 xxxd2175xxx  (gn) i s an inhibitor of bone resorption and thereby may result in a change in coupled
bone formation. in the present investigation the effects of gn on bone formation were studied in the rat osteosarcoma
(ros) 1 7 / 2 3 cell line and normal diploid rat osteoblasts (rob) in vitro and the femur of rats treated in vivo, measuring
mrna levels for two osteoblast parameters, type i collagen, a marker of matrix formation, and osteocalcin, a bone
specific protein and also histone hq, a marker of cell proliferation. gn, at 50 kmfor 3 h, increased type i collagen mrna
levels by 132% in ros 17/2.8 cells and by 122% in proliferating rob cells. osteocalcin (oc) mrna levels were
decreased by 61% in ros 1 7 / 2 3 cells and by 97% in differentiated rob cells. these changes occurred in the absence of
any effects on cell proliferation. seventy-day-oldfemale rats were then treated with gn, 0.5 mgikgiday, for 3 weeks. as
previously reported, gn decreased serum calcium levels, but had no effect on lumbar or femoral bone density. in
contrast to the in vitro effects, gn had no effect on type i collagen steady-state mrna levels in the femur; however, it
decreased oc steady-statemrna levels in the femur by 58%.these results suggest that gn has similar in vitro effects in
transformed and normal osteoblasts, while the collagen-stimulatory effects observed in vitro cannot be extrapolated to
in vivo models. the consistent inhibition of osteocalcin in vitro and in vivo suggests a more specific target for gn that
may relate to its effects in inhibiting bone resorption in normal rats. o 1993 wiiey-liss, inc.

 xxxd2175xxx  (gn) is effective in the treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy [warrell
et al., 1984,19871and high bone turnover states
such as paget’s disease [warrell, 19901. studies
suggest that gn is incorporated into bone after
short term administration and inhibits osteoclast function [donnelly, 1991; hall and choimbeus, 19901. in addition, in vitro studies suggest
that gn has effects on osteoblasts [bockman et
al., 1987; guidon and bockman, 1990; lakatos
et al., 19911. this combination of osteoclastic
and osteoblastic activity suggests that gn may
be a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of low bone density states such as osteoporosis.
the purpose of this study was to investigate
the effects of gn on osteoblast activity initially
in vitro in normal rat osteoblast cultures which
produce a bone-like mineralized matrix and in
the osteoblast-like rat osteosarcoma cell line
(ros) 1 7 / 2 3 and to compare these in vitro

activities to the effects of gn in vivo in normal
female rats. we measured cellular levels of osteoblast related mrnas, type i collagen, a gene
expressed early for bone formation, and osteocalcin, a gene expressed later reflecting active matrix mineralization [owen, 19901. additionally,
in vivo, bone density measurements were carried out. the results demonstrate that gn increases collagen mrna in normal and transformed rat osteoblasts in vitro but does not
appear to exert similar effects in vivo. in contrast, gn decreased osteocalcin mrna levels
both in vitro and in vivo. bone density after 3
weeks of therapy was not changed in the normal
rats, suggesting that the collagen-stimulatory
effects of gn in vitro cannot be extrapolated to
in vivo models. the consistent inhibition of osteocalcin in vitro and in vivo suggests a specific
target for gn that may relate to its effects in
inhibiting bone resorption.

rat osteosarcoma cell (ros 17/23] cultures
were grown and maintained at the cell culture
facility at the university of massachusetts med-

comparison of effects of  xxxd2175xxx  on bone

ical center (worcester, ma). cells were grown
in culture medium consisting of dulbecco minimum essential medium (dmem) and f12 (50:
50) and 5% fetal calf serum. normal diploid rat
osteoblasts (rob) were isolated from fetal rat
calvariae of 20 days gestation. calvariae were
subjected to sequential digestions of 20, 20, and
90 min at 37°c in 1mg/ml collagenase p (boehringer-mannheim, indianapolis, in) /0.25% trypsin (gibco, grand island, ny).the cells of the
first two digests were discarded, and those of the
third digestion were plated in mem and 10%
fetal calf serum as previously described [owen,
19901.
ros 1 7 / 2 3 and normal rat proliferating (day
3) and differentiated osteoblasts (day 28)
(1.0 x lo7 cellsiml) were treated at 37°c for 3 h
in hepes- xxxd2988xxx  (hepes-bss)

conclusion of the treatment the cells were
washed with hepes-bss without albumin, pelleted, and collected.
total cellular rna was isolated by the commercial rnazol method (cinnaibiotex labs,
friendswood, tx). the rna was resuspended
in diethylpyrocarbonate-treatedwater and quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm. the intactness
of the rna was determined by electrophoresis
on a 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide
staining. 4 pg of each rna sample was immobilized onto zetaprobe membranes (biorad) and
cross-linked by exposure to ultraviolet light for
1min.
animals

twenty female rats (70-day-old, 200 g, charles
river lab, wilmington, ma) were randomly divided into two groups. the animals were housed
four to a cage and fed standard lab chow and had
free access to water. rats in group one were
treated with (gn) (fujisawa, deerfield, il), 0.5
mgikglday, subcutaneously for 21 days. rats in
group two received a n equivalent dose of normal
saline subcutaneously for 21 days. after 21 days
of gn treatment, the animals were sacrificed
and serum obtained for osteocalcin, trap, albumin, creatinine, phosphorus, and calcium. each
femur consisting of the diaphysis and proximal
and distal metaphyses were immediately removed, stripped of soft tissue and periosteal

331

attachments, and immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at - 70°c until further analysis was performed. total cellular rna was
isolated as previously described [baran et al.,
1991; shalhoub et al., 19911 from each bone by a
modification of the chirgwin procedure [chirgwin et al., 19791. briefly, each frozen bone was
pulverized into a powder with a bessman tissue
pulverizer (fisher) precooled in liquid nitrogen,
placed in guanidium isothiocyanate, and rna
collected after centrifugation in a 5.7 m cesium
chloride gradient (36k revimin for 18 h at 20°c).
after ethanol precipitation, the rna was treated
with dnaase and an ethidium bromide gel
showed sharp 28s and 18s bands reflecting absence of dna. rna was quantitated by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and the 2601280
nm ratio was measured to ensure the absence of
protein contamination. rna was handled similarly to that obtained from in vitro samples from
this point on. ten micrograms of each sample
was immobilized onto zetaprobe membranes
(biorad) using northern and slot blot analysis.
probes were labeled by the random primer
method [feinberg and vogelstein, 19831 using
c l ( ~dctp
~ p ) and included overnight hybridizations of mrna to osteocalcin (poc 3.4) [lian et
al., 19891, type i collagen (alr1) [genovese et
al., 19841,  xxxg1052xxx  (pps2) [grimes et al.,

 xxxg45xxx  (trap)
[kotcham et al., 19891, and ribosomal rna (28s)
(ls6) [wilson et al., 19761. the resultant autoradiographs were quantitated by scanning laser
densitometry (lkb 2400 gelscan x 1)and mrna
values normalized to ribosomal rna.
bone mineral densities were measured of the
left femur and l4-l5 vertebral body segments
using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (hologic qdr looo/w, waltham, ma). the animals
were anesthetized with 0.3 cc ip injection of
ketamine (70%) and rompum (30%). measurements were made at baseline and every week
until the completion of the study. bone mineral
densities were measured on one rat five times
over a 2 day period. the coefficient of variation
for the spine and femur were 3.39% and 0.92%,
respectively.
serum creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, and
albumin were measured using a beckman cx-4.
osteocalcin was measured using a commercial
radioimmunoassay kit for rat osteocalcin (biomedical technologies inc., stoughton, ma). tar-

man et al., 19891and greater than the concentration used our in vitro investigations (50 pm).
therefore, one would expect to detect increased
or stimulated bone formation parameters at the
conclusion of the treatment if they were to occur. indeed, since osteocalcin mrna was decreased in vivo, at least this parameter of osteoblast activity is affected. the dosage used in the
present study is 10%of the effective dose used to
treat hypercalcemia of malignancy [bockman et
al., 19891 and it is unlikely that higher dosages
would be well tolerated in normocalcemic humans or rats with the intent of increasing bone
formation.
preliminary reports have described the effects
of gn in vitro and in vivo. gn, in concentrations
varying from 0 to 200 fm for 48 h, caused a
dose-dependent increase in procollagen mrna
levels in ros 17/2.8 and normal osteoblast cell
lines [bockman et al., 1987; guidon and bockman, 19901. our results at 50 km, demonstrating an increase after 3 hours of gn exposure,
are consistent with these reports [bockman et
al., 1987; guidon and bockman, 19901 but further identify a possible role for gn in bone
formation through its rapid increase in gene
expression of collagen. another study under different conditions does not show increases in
collagen. in mouse calvarial organ cultures, preincubation for 24 h with 7.2 pm gn followed by
pth or la,25(oh)zd3 was demonstrated not
only t o be a powerful inhibitor of bone resorption, but also to decrease collagen synthesis
[lakatos et al., 19911. there are several possible
explanations for the differing effects seen in
each study, including the present investigation,
which include different concentrations of gn
and different systems utilized, along with varying lengths of treatment. a biphasic effect on
type i collagen synthesis by gn has been proposed by several authors [lakatos et al., 19911.
it has been reported that gn causes mild
hypocalcemia in two thirds of patients that receive it for hypercalcemia of malignancy [warre11 et al., 19841. recently, it has also been
shown to significantly reduce serum calcium
levels in rats [wakley et al., 19921. our results
agree with these findings. we found a significantly lower serum calcium level in the gntreated rats than in the rats treated with normal
saline. this difference could not be explained by
a difference in the  xxxg124xxx  levels in the

335

saline-treated animals. similarly, gn, 0.9 mgi
kgld, for 21 days has been shown to inhibit
endosteal formation and apposition rate in rats
[wakley et al., 19921. this histomorphometric
study supports our findings of unaltered expression of type i collagen mrna in the femur of
rats treated with gn for 21 days. thus, although gn appears to increase collagen production in vitro [bockman et al., 1987; guidon and
bockman, 19901 [table 11, at doses that could be
tolerated by normocalcemic subjects, it has no
effect on type i collagen mrna levels in vivo
(table vii) and inhibits bone formation [wakley
et al., 19921.
in summary, we have shown that gn increases basal type i collagen mrna levels, reduces basal osteocalcin mrna levels, and modifies the effects of la,25(oh)2d3in transformed
and normal rat osteoblasts in vitro. we have also
shown that gn reduces osteocalcin steady-state
mrna levels, while having no effect on type i
collagen mrna levels or bone mineral density in
vivo. this lack of effect in vivo suggests that the
activity of gn in vitro may not be extrapolated
to in vivo treatments. thus, the in vitro effects
of gn and other agents must be analyzed cautiously with respect to in vivo investigation.
however, the consistent inhibition of osteocalcin both in vivo and in vitro suggests a more
specific target for gn that may relate to its
effects in inhibiting bone resorption. osteocalcin function has been implicated in mediating
bone resorption by promoting recruitment and
differentiation of osteoclast progenitors [glowacki and lian, 1987; glowacki et al., 19891. thus,
gn may have therapeutic potential specifically
in a high hone turnover osteoporotic state similar to its usefulness in hypercalcemia of malignancy and paget’s disease [warrell et al., 1984,
1987; warrell, 19901. further in vivo investigations in different model systems relevant to osteoporosis will be necessary for clinical decisions
to be made regarding the use of  xxxd2175xxx .
