hand eczema is a common skin disorder, and is
characterized by scaling, fissures, erythema, vesicles, papules, hyperkeratosis, itching and
pain.[1] additionally, it has a remitting and relapsing course, with disease returning even after
sporadic remission.[1] the 1-year prevalence of
hand eczema is thought to be Â»10%; chronic severe hand eczema patients make up 5â€“7% of these
patients, and those with topical treatmentrefractory disease make up 2â€“4%.[1] an estimate
of the annual incidence of hand eczema placed it
at 5 per 1000 people per year.[1]
the disease is multifactorial; several predisposing endogenous and exogenous factors can
affect the chances of developing hand eczema,
including being atopic, certain genetic factors and
contact with irritants or contact allergens.[1,2] in
many countries, work-related hand eczema is the
top-ranked occupational disease with regard to
incidence.[1]
hand eczema is associated with a significant
negative impact on quality of life and, as the
disease is highly visible, anxiety, low self-esteem,
social phobia and other psychosocial problems
may occur.[1] increased severity of hand eczema
has been shown to be significantly correlated to
decreased quality of life.[3] additionally, hand
eczema has been linked to huge economic loss; it
is a major cause of lost earnings, as well as morbidity.[1] a recent study investigating the societal
costs of severe, refractory, chronic hand eczema
in germany showed that total annual costs (in
the base case scenario) came to h860 million (year
of cost not reported).[4]
most hand eczema can be managed with skin
protection measures (non-medical), either with or
without topical treatments, such as corticosteroids.[1] however, some (those with chronic,
topical treatment-refractory disease) require systemic treatment, as recurrent or prolonged use of
potent topical corticosteroids is associated with
potential skin atrophy and other cutaneous adverse events.[1,5,6] various systemic treatments
can be used, such as oral immunosuppressants
(e.g. ciclosporin [used off label in hand eczema]),
short treatment courses of oral corticosteroids and oral  xxxd114xxx  (9-cis-retinoic
acid;  xxxd114xxx ), the only drug specifically apÂª 2009 adis data information bv. all rights reserved.

proved for use in severe chronic hand eczema.
however, systemic treatments are not without
their limitations; ciclosporin has been associated
with relapse occurring soon after the end of treatment as well as being a potent immunosuppressant,[5] and oral corticosteroids are associated with
long-term adverse events such as osteoporosis,
glaucoma, cataracts, hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis suppression, hyperglycaemia, hypertension and immunosuppression.[5]
oral  xxxd114xxx , administered once daily, is
an endogenous retinoid indicated for the treatment of adults with severe chronic hand eczema
unresponsive to potent topical corticosteroids.[7]
this article provides an overview of the pharmacological properties of  xxxd114xxx  and reviews
the clinical trial data available on the efficacy
and tolerability of the drug in adults with severe
refractory chronic hand eczema. topical  xxxd114xxx  for the treatment of kaposiâ€™s sarcoma is
also available, which is reviewed elsewhere.[8]
medical literature on the use of  xxxd114xxx 
in chronic hand eczema was identified using
medline and embase, supplemented by adisbase (a proprietary database of wolters kluwer
health | adis). additional references were identified from the reference lists of published articles.
1. pharmacodynamic profile
this section includes data from two clinical trials
in patients with chronic hand eczema,[9,10] the manufacturerâ€™s prescribing information,[7] several in vitro
studies[11-15] and one study in healthy volunteers,[4]
supplemented by data from reviews.[8,16,17]
mechanism of action

although the exact mechanism of action of  xxxd114xxx  in severe chronic hand eczema is not yet
understood, retinoids are known to affect numerous
processes at a cellular level, including cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. the efficacy of
these drugs in the treatment of this disease may also
be explained by effects on immunomodulation, inflammation, angiogenesis, keratinisation and sebum
secretion.[7,16,17] unlike isotretinoin,  xxxd114xxx  has
drugs 2009; 69 (12)

 xxxd114xxx : adis drug profile

only a minimal effect on sebum secretion in
humans.[7,18]
there are two nuclear receptor families for
which retinoids are specific agonists:  xxxd3417xxx 
receptors (rars) and retinoid x receptors
(rxrs), each consisting of three subtypes (a, b
and g).[16,17] these receptors form heterodimers
with other receptors; while rars can only bind
to rxrs,[17] rxrs bind to many different
nuclear receptors, including both rars and
rxrs.[16] once dimerized, the receptors function
as ligand-inducible transcription factors.[16,17]
 the most common retinoid receptors in human skin are rar-g and rxr-a.[8] no link
between receptor binding patterns and therapeutic efficacy (section 3) of  xxxd114xxx  in chronic
hand eczema has been shown,[9] and other
retinoids that bind to rar are not effective in
patients with chronic hand eczema.[10]
  xxxd114xxx  is a pan-agonist, binding to and
activating rar and rxr receptors in vitro with
high affinity and in a saturable manner, while
other retinoids bind to subgroups of either
rar or rxr.[11]  xxxd114xxx  binds with higher
affinity to rars than to rxrs. the dissociation constants (kd) for rar-a, -b and -g were
0.31, 0.20 and 0.78 nmol/l, respectively; the
kd for rxr-a, -b and -g were 1.62, 2.36
and 2.29 nmol/l, respectively. no binding of
 xxxd3417xxx  to rxrs was detectable at 100 nmol/l, and  xxxd3417xxx 
demonstrated similar kd to  xxxd114xxx  for
rar-a, -b and -g (0.37, 0.37 and 0.22 nmol/l,
respectively).
  xxxd114xxx  was as potent as all-trans-retinoic
acid and more potent than 11- xxxd2404xxx 
and 13- xxxd2404xxx  (isotretinoin) as an rar-a
activator in an in vitro study.[12]
  xxxd114xxx  showed high affinity for the rxr
receptor and was Â»40-fold more potent at rxr-a
activation than  xxxd3417xxx , 11-cisretinoic acid and 13- xxxd2404xxx .[12]
 as is well established for rxr ligands,[16]  xxxd114xxx  can activate rxr when in homodimers or in
heterodimers with certain other receptors (permissive
partners;[16] e.g. the liver x receptor), but not when
rxr is in heterodimers with another group of

1627

receptors (nonpermissive partners[16]), which includes
rar.[13] thus, an rxr-rar heterodimer can only
be activated via rar.[13] it has been shown that
 xxxd114xxx  induces the homodimerization of rxr
receptors.[14]
immunomodulatory and
anti-inflammatory effects

  xxxd114xxx  has shown both immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects.[7,15] in
lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse microglia,  xxxd114xxx  inhibited the production of  xxxd2738xxx 
(no),  xxxg2296xxx  (tnf)-a, interleukin (il)-1b and il-12 p40, but was associated
with an increase in monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 production.[15] in lipopolysaccharidestimulated mouse astrocytes,  xxxd114xxx  was
associated with decreased no and  xxxg2296xxx  production.[15]  xxxd114xxx  is also associated with
downregulation of chemokine (cxc motif)
receptor 3 ligands and chemokine (c-c motif)
ligand 20 in cytokine-stimulated keratinocytes
and dermal endothelial cells,[7] as well as suppression of the expansion of cytokine-activated
leukocyte subsets and antigen-presenting cells.[7]
2. pharmacokinetic profile
this section focuses on data from the uk
summary of product characteristics,[7] supplemented by data from a randomized, doubleblind, multiple-dose (10 or 30 mg/day) study in
adult patients (n = 32) with moderate or severe
treatment-refractory chronic hand eczema (reported in a poster),[19] as well as other, more
specific, studies in healthy volunteers (also available as posters).[20-22] the pharmacokinetics of
 xxxd114xxx  have not been investigated in patients
with hepatic or severe renal insufficiency or in
patients aged <18 years.
absorption and distribution

 patients with chronic hand eczema demonstrate
dose-proportional absorption of  xxxd114xxx 
10â€“30 mg after oral administration.[7]  xxxd114xxx 
absolute bioavailability has not been determined.[7]

 after a single 10 or 30 mg dose in patients
with chronic hand eczema, area under the
plasma concentration-time curve (auc) values
were 113.3 and 300.9 ng h/ml and maximum
plasma concentration (cmax) values were 50.7
and 104.7 ng/ml.[19] time to cmax (tmax) [estimated from a graph] was Â»3â€“4 hours for both
doses.[19]
 following multiple doses of  xxxd114xxx  10 or
30 mg once daily, auc values were 123.4 and
362.8 ng h/ml, and cmax values were 56.7 and
150.5 ng/ml on day 28;[19] tmax values (estimated
from a graph) remained at Â»3â€“4 hours. no
accumulation was observed after up to 24 weeks
of treatment and there were no time-dependent
changes in  xxxd114xxx  disposition.[7]
 systemic exposure to  xxxd114xxx  is increased
by a factor of 4 and exposure variability is
decreased when it is taken with food.[7,21] thirty
healthy volunteers received  xxxd114xxx  40 mg
with or without food. respective mean auc
and cmax values were 220.2 versus 55.7 ng h/ml
and 82.8 versus 25.4 ng/ml (both p < 0.001).
systemic
exposure
variability
decreased
from 72% without food to 40% with food.
 xxxd114xxx  should thus be taken with a meal
(section 5).[7]
 while the volume of distribution of  xxxd114xxx  has not been determined in humans, animal
studies have demonstrated that it is likely to be
greater than the extracellular volume.[7]  xxxd114xxx  is strongly bound to plasma proteins.[7]
 low concentrations of  xxxd114xxx  in seminal
fluid were detected after multiple doses of the
drug in 12 healthy men receiving  xxxd114xxx 
40 mg once daily for 14 days.[22] seminal fluid
samples taken 4 hours after the second dose
revealed a maximum  xxxd114xxx  concentration
of 7.921 ng/ml. assuming complete absorption,
this would correspond to a calculated increase in
the  xxxd114xxx  plasma levels in the female
partner of 0.016 ng/ml; this increase is negligible
when compared with endogenous plasma levels.
related retinoids were also at negligible levels in
the semen.  xxxd114xxx  administration in male
patients is unlikely to affect  xxxd114xxx  levels in
female partners via seminal transmission of the
drug.[22]

  xxxd114xxx  is highly lipophilic and, as it is
probably distributed in breastmilk, is contraindicated in breast-feeding women.[7]
metabolism and elimination

  xxxd114xxx  undergoes oxidation by cytochrome p450 (cyp) 3a4 in the liver;[7] its major
metabolite is 4-oxo- xxxd114xxx .[7,20] both  xxxd114xxx  and 4-oxo- xxxd114xxx  are isomerized
into  xxxd3417xxx  and 4-oxo-all-transretinoic acid.[7] in the plasma, 4-oxo- xxxd114xxx 
accounts for 35â€“80% of the systemic exposure of
 xxxd114xxx , it is then glucuronidated and eliminated in the urine.[7]  xxxd114xxx  is also degraded
to retinol by cleavage of the carbon side chain.[7]
  xxxd114xxx  is mainly excreted in the urine,
with a smaller fraction eliminated in the
faeces.[7,20] the manufacturerâ€™s prescribing information states that approximately 94% of a
dose of radio-labelled  xxxd114xxx  was recovered,
making the excretion complete.[7] after administration of a single dose of  xxxd114xxx  40 mg and
a single dose of [11-14c]-labelled  xxxd114xxx 
0.47 mg in six healthy volunteers, 63.2% of the
total radioactivity was excreted in the urine and
30.3% in the faeces.[20] most radioactively
labelled compounds (mean 93.5%) were eliminated within 5 days.[20]
 the most common identifiable radioactive
product in the urine was the glucuronidated form
of 4-oxo- xxxd114xxx  (6.5% of the total); unchanged  xxxd114xxx  and 4-oxo- xxxd114xxx  in
the faeces made up 1% and 3% of the total
dose.[20] a total of 54% and 14% of the
administered dose was excreted as unidentified
cleavage products in the urine and faeces,
respectively.
 in patients receiving  xxxd114xxx  10 or
30 mg/day for 24 weeks, plasma concentrations of
both  xxxd114xxx  and its metabolites returned to
normal ranges after 2â€“7 days following treatment
discontinuation.[19] the half-lives were 6.5 and 4.9
hours for the 10 and 30 mg/day dosages on day 28.
the corresponding 4-oxo- xxxd114xxx  half-lives
were 6.6 and 7.4 hours.[19] the manufacturerâ€™s
prescribing information states that the elimination
half-life of  xxxd114xxx  is 2â€“10 hours.[7]

drug interactions

  xxxd114xxx  30 mg pharmacokinetics were
not significantly altered by concomitant simvastatin 40 mg or ciclosporin 300 mg (both cyp3a4
substrates) administration in an open-label
study in 54 healthy volunteers (available as a
poster presentation).[23] however, ketoconazole
200 mg (a strong cyp3a4 inhibitor) administration was associated with significantly (p < 0.05)
increased  xxxd114xxx  auc from time zero to
infinity (aucÂ¥) and cmax values after both
single and multiple  xxxd114xxx  doses, potentially
a result of inhibition of cyp3a4-mediated
metabolism.[23]
 ciclosporin and ketoconazole pharmacokinetics were not significantly altered during concomitant  xxxd114xxx  administration; however,
simvastatin systemic exposure was decreased.[23]
a single  xxxd114xxx  dose significantly (p = 0.037)
decreased the simvastatin cmax value and multiple doses decreased both cmax and aucÂ¥ values
(both p < 0.05).
 no clinically relevant changes in either  xxxd114xxx  or  xxxd2054xxx / xxxd2753xxx  pharmacokinetics occurred following coadministration
of these drugs in an open-label study (published
as a poster), indicating that there are no drugdrug interactions between  xxxd114xxx  and oral
contraceptives.[24]
3. therapeutic efficacy
the efficacy of oral  xxxd114xxx  in adult patients with severe chronic hand eczema refractory
to conventional therapy has been investigated
in a large (n = 1032), randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multicentre study (the benefit of  xxxd114xxx  in chronic hand eczema
[bach] study),[9] a pilot study (n = 38)[10] and
a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
dose-finding, multicentre study (n = 319).[25] this
section focuses on the largest study.[9] preliminary data from two re-treatment studies
in responders to the original treatment who
relapsed (reported in a poster)[26] and nonresponders to the original treatment (reported in
an oral presentation)[27] are also reviewed.

 in the pilot study,[10] 55% of patients receiving
 xxxd114xxx  20 or 40 mg once daily achieved a
â€˜very goodâ€™ (81â€“100% reduction of total lesion
symptom score) response; however, as most
patients received a dosage higher than that
currently recommended, these data are not
discussed further.[10] results from the dosefinding study[25] confirmed these findings, showing a significant (p < 0.001) dose-dependent effect
in the primary endpoint, with 27% of placebo,
39% of  xxxd114xxx  10 mg/day, 41% of  xxxd114xxx 
20 mg/day and 53% of  xxxd114xxx  40 mg/day
recipients showing a â€˜clearâ€™ or â€˜almost clearâ€™
rating on the physician global assessment
(pga; ratings of â€˜severeâ€™, â€˜moderateâ€™, â€˜mildâ€™,
â€˜almost clearâ€™ or â€˜clearâ€™).[25]
the bach study

the bach study included  xxxd114xxx -naive
adult patients (aged 18â€“75 years) with severe
chronic hand eczema (any type) refractory to
standard therapy, of â€¡6 monthsâ€™ duration.[9] severity was defined using the pga. to achieve
refractory status, patients had demonstrated no
or transient response to â€¡8 weeksâ€™ topical corticosteroid treatment (including 4 weeksâ€™ treatment
with a potent corticosteroid) in the 6 months before enrolment, received standard skin care, and
avoided irritants and allergens. other potential
chronic hand eczema mimicking conditions had
been ruled out. women of child-bearing potential
had to be using at least two forms of contraception for â€¡1 month before treatment, during
treatment and â€¡1 month following treatment
completion. monthly pregnancy tests were also
required in these patients.
exclusion criteria included abnormal laboratory test results; a centre for epidemiological
studies depression scale score â€¡20; a history of
major psychotic disorders; or recent or current
treatment with investigational drugs, other eczema therapies (including retinoids) or drugs with
the potential for drug-drug interactions.[9]
patients were randomized to treatment with
 xxxd114xxx  10 (n = 418) or 30 (n = 409) mg/day or
placebo (n = 205), taken after breakfast, for up to
24 weeks.[9] patients who responded to treatment

(rating of â€˜clearâ€™ or â€˜almost clearâ€™ on the pga)
after 12 weeks stopped treatment; other patients
continued for the full 24 weeks.
the primary endpoint of this study was the
response (rating of â€˜clearâ€™ or â€˜almost clearâ€™ on the
pga) rate. assessments using the pga were
based on the area of skin involved and the severity of signs and symptoms (erythema, scaling,
pruritis/pain, oedema, fissures, hyperkeratosis/
lichenification, vesiculation).[9] secondary endpoints included modified total lesion symptom
score (mtlss; rating of 0â€“3 for the severity
of each of seven chronic hand eczema parameters), partial response rate (rating of
â€˜clearâ€™, â€˜almost clearâ€™ or â€˜mild diseaseâ€™ on the
pga), patient global assessment (paga;
ratings of â€˜worseningâ€™, â€˜no changeâ€™, â€˜mild improvementâ€™, â€˜moderate improvementâ€™, â€˜marked
improvementâ€™ or â€˜clear or almost clearâ€™), time
to response and time to relapse.[9] relapse was
defined as an mtlss score â€¡75% of baseline.
evaluations of treatment efficacy were conducted
every 4 weeks.
at baseline, all patients had chronic hand eczema rated as â€˜severeâ€™, except for one with â€˜moderateâ€™
disease.[9] slightly more males (56%) than females
(44%) were included and the mean age was 48
years.[9] some patients had more than one type of
chronic hand eczema; types included hyperkeratotic (85% of patients), pompholyx (27%), fingertip
(46%) and other (14%). forty-four percent of
patients had shown no response to previous
corticosteroid therapy, 53% had shown a transient
response and 2% had not tolerated corticosteroids.[9] the mean mtlss was 15.0 at baseline.[9]
assessments were based on the intent-to-treat
population
using
last-observation-carriedforward imputation.[9] baseline characteristics
did not significantly differ between groups.
  xxxd114xxx  10 and 30 mg/day were significantly more effective than placebo with
regard to the primary endpoint of response rate
in adults with severe chronic hand eczema
refractory to potent topical corticosteroid therapy.[9] a total of 47.7% (195 of 409 patients;

with 27.5% (115 of 418) of recipients responding
(9.3% â€˜clearâ€™ and 18.2% â€˜almost clearâ€™).[9]

of responding patients who had not relapsed by the
end of the 24-week post-treatment follow-up
period were 70.4% (81 of 115 patients), 62.6%
(122 of 195) and 55.9% (19 of 34).[7]
 efficacy remained dose dependent for all
disease types.[9] patients with hyperkeratotic
disease had response rates of 28% (102 of 362)
and 49% (170 of 349) versus 12% (21 of 170
patients) with  xxxd114xxx  10 and 30 mg/day
versus placebo treatment, respectively. corresponding figures for patients with pompholyx
and those with fingertip disease were 23% (25 of

and 29% (53 of 180) and 44% (87 of 196) versus
18% (18 of 101). these disease types were not
mutually exclusive. no statistical data were
reported for these subgroups.[9]

 xxxd114xxx : adis drug profile

bach extension studies

responders to the initial treatment in the
bach study who had relapsed within 24 weeks
(no active drug treatment for chronic hand eczema
was allowed during this time) were re-randomized
to treatment with placebo or the original dosage of
 xxxd114xxx  (10 or 30 mg/day) for 12 or 24 weeks;
responders to placebo received placebo again.[26]
a total of 117 patients were randomized (2  1).
of previous  xxxd114xxx  10 mg/day responders, 10
received placebo and 21 received  xxxd114xxx 
10 mg/day, and of previous  xxxd114xxx  30 mg/day
responders, 24 received placebo and 49 received
 xxxd114xxx  30 mg/day; 13 responders to previous
placebo treatment were included.
the primary endpoint was, as in the main
bach study, pga response rate.[26] additional
secondary endpoints included the mtlss and
the paga.
in an additional extension study, 243 patients
from the bach study who did not respond or had
an incomplete response to initial treatment were
enrolled in an open-label extension study and treated with 30 mg/day  xxxd114xxx  for 12â€“24 weeks.[27]
 repeated treatment with  xxxd114xxx  was
effective in patients who had relapsed following
initial treatment with the drug.[7,26] previous
responders to  xxxd114xxx  30 mg/day responded
to re-treatment with the same dosage at a
significantly higher rate than previous responders
receiving placebo (80% vs 8%; p < 0.001).[7,26] of
those who had responded to initial treatment
with  xxxd114xxx  10 mg/day, 48% of  xxxd114xxx 
10 mg/day and 10% of placebo recipients responded during the extension phase (p = 0.10).[7,26]
previous placebo responders again had a high
response rate (70%).[26]
 the proportions of  xxxd114xxx  10 and 30 mg/day
recipients who rated their disease as â€˜clear or almost
clearâ€™ on the paga (a secondary endpoint) were
numerically higher than the proportion of placebo
recipients (38.1% and 75.5% vs 21.3%), as was the
median percentage reduction from baseline in
mtlss (70.8% and 92.3% vs 42.9%).[26]
  xxxd114xxx  30 mg/day may be effective in patients who did not respond or had a partial response
to initial  xxxd114xxx  treatment.[27] upon treatment

with  xxxd114xxx  30 mg/day, 50% of previous  xxxd114xxx  10 mg/day non/partial responders, 39% of
previous  xxxd114xxx  30 mg/day non/partial responders and 51% of previous placebo non/partial
responders responded to treatment, with pga
ratings of â€˜clearâ€™ or â€˜almost clearâ€™.[27]
4. tolerability
tolerability data for oral  xxxd114xxx  are available from the clinical trials discussed in section 3.
this section focuses mainly on data from the
bach study[9] and its extension study in patients
who responded to treatment,[26] supplemented by
data from the dose-finding study[25] and the manufacturerâ€™s prescribing information.[7]
 in the dose-finding study,[25]  xxxd114xxx  10
and 20 mg/day was generally well tolerated, with
dose-dependent effects. a total of 35% of both
 xxxd114xxx  10 and 20 mg/day recipients reported
at least one adverse event, 35% of placebo
recipients also had at least one adverse event.
the most common adverse event was headache
in both groups. no particular adverse event led
to more than one patient withdrawing from
sthe study in the 10 or 20 mg/day groups.[25]
 in the bach study,  xxxd114xxx  treatment for
Â£24 weeks was generally well tolerated in adults
with severe chronic hand eczema refractory to
standard topical corticosteroid therapy.[9] the most
common treatment-emergent adverse events and
abnormal laboratory test results (figure 1) appear
to be dose dependent and were consistent with
those observed with other oral retinoids and rxr
agonists (such as headache and mucocutaneous
effects). treatment-related adverse events occurred
in 34.5%, 37.1% and 49.5% of placebo (n = 203),
 xxxd114xxx  10 mg/day (n = 410) and  xxxd114xxx 
30 mg/day (n = 418) groups, respectively.[29]
 the only adverse event that led to withdrawal in two or more patients in any treatment
group in the bach study was headache (1%, 4% and 1% of patients withdrew
from the  xxxd114xxx  10 mg/day, 30 mg/day
and placebo groups, respectively).[9] one percent
of each treatment group reported a treatmentrelated serious adverse event;[29] all serious
drugs 2009; 69 (12)

events appeared to reflect common health problems in the target population.[9] no treatmentrelated deaths occurred in this study.[9]
 abnormally high cholesterol and triglyceride
and low  xxxd3368xxx  levels were
evident with  xxxd114xxx  treatment in the bach
study (figure 1); however, these abnormalities are
typical retinoid or rxr agonists, and medication
to treat them was not routinely required.[9]
additionally, these changes as observed in
clinical trials are dose dependent and reversible,
and may thus be improved by dosage reduction.[7]
the uk summary of product characteristics
recommends that serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels should be monitored, and
 xxxd114xxx  should be discontinued if hypertriglyceridaemia can not be controlled.[7]
 on re-treatment, among responders, adverse
events were similar to those reported in the
bach study, with headache the most common
event among  xxxd114xxx  30 mg/day recipients.[26]
no adverse event led to more than one withdrawal and no drug-related deaths occurred.
laboratory abnormalities were also consistent
with the bach study.
  xxxd114xxx  is an endogenous retinoid, an
isomer of isotretinoin and tretinoin; retinoids are
teratogenic, and thus pregnancy is an absolute
contraindication to  xxxd114xxx  therapy.[7] women
of child-bearing potential must meet the conditions
of the pregnancy prevention programme before
they are permitted to be treated with  xxxd114xxx . if
pregnancy occurs during or up to 1 month after
treatment with  xxxd114xxx , there is a great risk of
severe and serious fetal malformation. potential
fetal malformations (associated with retinoids)
include facial dysmorphia, cleft palate, and cns,
external ear, eye, cardiovascular, thymus gland
and parathyroid abnormalities. retinoid therapy
has also been associated with spontaneous
abortion.[7]
 other retinoid class effects include the
potential for psychiatric disorders, musculoskeletal effects, connective tissue disorders, eye
disorders, benign intracranial hypertension
(potentially linked with concomitant tetracycline use), enhanced effects of ultraviolet
light,
hepatobiliary
disorders,

testinal disorders, allergic reactions, decreased
night vision and diabetes mellitus.[7] inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, colour blindness and
contact lens intolerance, while observed with
other retinoids, have not been observed in
 xxxd114xxx  clinical trials.[7]

5. dosage and administration
the recommended dosage for oral  xxxd114xxx 
in adult patients with chronic refractory hand
eczema is 10â€“30 mg once daily, with a recommended starting dosage of 30 mg once daily.[7]
the drug should always be taken with a meal in
order to optimize exposure and reduce variability. treatment duration should be between
12 and 24 weeks, depending on response. for
patients with continuing severe disease after
12 weeks of treatment, discontinuation of therapy should be considered.
the recommended initial dosage for high-risk
patients (patients with diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular risk factors or a lipid metabolism disorder) is 10 mg once daily; the dosage may be
increased to 30 mg once daily if required.[7]
women of child-bearing potential should
receive treatment for a maximum of 30 days
and the conditions of the pregnancy prevention
programme must be met, including effective
contraception and regular pregnancy testing.[7]
pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to
 xxxd114xxx  treatment, as the drug is teratogenic;
in the event of pregnancy, there would be a
great risk of very severe, serious fetal malformation.[7] other contraindications include
hepatic or severe renal insufficiency and breastfeeding.[7]
concomitant treatment with tetracyclines is
not permitted, as there have been reports of benign intracranial hypertension among patients
receiving both retinoids and tetracyclines.[7]
local prescribing information should be consulted for detailed information, including further
contraindications, precautions, drug interactions
and use in special patient populations.

 xxxd114xxx  10 (n = 418) or 30 (n = 409) mg or placebo (n = 205) once daily after breakfast, for up to 24 weeks. high cholesterol levels were
defined as >7.7 mmol/l, high triglyceride levels as >5.66 mmol/l and low  xxxd3368xxx  (tsh) levels as <0.6 mu/l (in patients
aged Â£20 years) or <0.3 mu/l (in patients aged >20 years).

6.  xxxd114xxx : current status
oral  xxxd114xxx  is approved in several eu
countries and is undergoing the approval process
in others for use in adult patients with severe
chronic hand eczema that is unresponsive to potent topical corticosteroids.
 xxxd114xxx  was effective and generally well
tolerated in adult patients with severe chronic
hand eczema refractory to topical corticosteroid
treatment in a large, well designed trial and extension phases of that trial.
