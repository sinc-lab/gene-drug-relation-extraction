advantage
was
the low incidence

was increased

for one further

and so on to a maximum
daily
dosage
of 400 mg, the final dosage
being
maintained
for a further
three
weeks
irrespective
of result.
at the end of the trial, it transpired
that the hypertension
of the patients
receiving
the once-daily
doses of  xxxd329xxx 
was controlled
just as well as in
the patients
receiving
divided
doses.
because
the
half-life
of  xxxd329xxx 
is about
100
mm only,
the
implication
is that the cardiovascular
system
adapts
to repeated
interruption
of sympathetic
control
in a
manner
which
long outlasts
the presence
of the
blocking
drugs
themselves,
as indeed
had already
been established
previously.26
another
comparison
of the efficacy
of onceor
twice-daily
administration
of  xxxd329xxx 
to 17 hypertensive
patients
was undertaken
by al-khawaja
et al,27 who
monitored
blood
pressure
by 24-hour
ambulatory
intra-arterial
recordings.
after
a fourweek drug-free
period,
a 24-hour
recording,
and full
investigation,
including
tilt and exercise
test, was
carried
out, after which
all patients
were
given
 xxxd329xxx 
100 mg twice
daily for two weeks,
the dose
being
increased
to 200 mg if the diastolic
pressure
was still higher
than
95 mm hg. in four patients
a
fu,rther
increase
to 300 mg was required.
after two
weeks
on the appropriate
regimen,
another
24-hour
recording
and investigation
was undertaken,
after
which
the appropriate
amount
of  xxxd329xxx 
was
given
in a single
dose daily for four weeks,
the trial
concluding
with
a third
24-hour
recording
and investigation,
although
the third
recording
was declined
by six patients.
the three
important
findings
were:
(1) control
of
blood
pressure
was as good on the once-daily
as on
the twice-daily
regimen;
(2)  xxxd329xxx ,
unlike
other
beta blockers
previously
studied
( xxxd2957xxx ,
atenolol),
abolished
the early
morning
rise in blood
pressure,
which
is normally
observed
as part of the circadian
rhythm
and which
is believed
to be due to an increase
in peripheral
arterial
tone
mediated
by
alpha-adrenoceptors
(thus  xxxd329xxx 
lowered
blood
pressure
to approximately
the same extent
throughout the 24 hours);
and (3) none of the patients
developed
the serious
side effects
sometimes
associated
with
beta blockade,
such
as cold hands,
excessive
bradycardia,
bronchospasm,
impotence,
or low cardiac output.
because
it was now established
that  xxxd329xxx 
was effective
when
given once daily,
a comparative
study
of the efficacy
of once-daily
doses of atenolol
and  xxxd329xxx 
was undertaken
on 227 hypertensive
patients
by fairhurst.28
subjects

and after 12 weeks
the control

regimens.
the
onset of the antihypertensive

was slower
in this trial
than
to atenolol,
and the
reduction
in heart

with atenolol

were the rises in growth
hormone
and noradrenaline
concentrations
after
 xxxd329xxx ,
which
are reminiscent
of the response
to the alpha-2
adrenoceptor
antagonist
idazoxan.
the
rise
in

 xxxd329xxx ,

a new

growth
hormone
is consistent
with moderate
 xxxg831xxx  receptor
agonist
activity.
the rise in noradrenaline
suggests
that
 xxxd329xxx 
may
also
have
central
alpha-2
adrenoceptor
antagonist
activity.
taken
together,
the results
suggest
that  xxxd329xxx 
may be a
weak partial
agonist
at central
alpha-2
receptor
sites.
the other
investigation
of particular
interest
was
the comparison
by cooke
et al32 of the peripheral
vascular
effects
of  xxxd329xxx 
200 mg and of ate nolol
100 mg daily
for seven
days in a randomized
double-blind
crossover
trial in ten healthy
male volunteers. resting
heart
rate, blood pressure,
upper
limb
blood
flow (forearm
and right index
finger),
and microcirculatory
bloodflow
(both middle
fingers)
were
measured;
and lung
function
tests
performed,
at
baseline
and following
an infusion
of  xxxd2401xxx ,
starting
at 0.5 ig/min,
increasing
by 0.5 ig/min
to
2.0 g/min,
each infusion
lasting
15 mm or until
an
endpoint
of a heart
rate of 160 beats/mm
(which
was never,
in fact, reached).
the procedure
was repeated
two and 24 hr after the oral administration
of
the first and last dose of the drug selected.
after
a
two-week
drug-free
period,
the whole
procedure
was repeated
with the other
drug.
two and 24 hr after the first dose of either
drug,
skin blood flow was slightly
reduced.
with continuous dosage
of  xxxd329xxx ,
skin blood
flow was increased
above
baseline,
whereas
with atenolol,
skin
blood
flow remained
below
the baseline
level.
the time to maximal
filling
of the microcirculation was persistently
and significantly
increased
by
atenolol,
but this effect was observed
at two hr only
after  xxxd329xxx ,
whereafter
the effect disappeared.
“finger
blood
flow was reduced
and vascular
resistance
increased
following
the infusion
of  xxxd2401xxx .
following
 xxxd329xxx 
there
was no significant change
in either,
whereas
with atenolol
finger
blood
flow fell and peripheral
vascular
resistance
was persistently
increased.”32
neither
beta blocker
had a significantly
different
effect
on the reduction
in systolic
blood
pressure,
but atenolol
was more
effective
than
 xxxd329xxx 
in
reducing
 xxxd2401xxx -induced
tachycardia.
there
is, in fact, a substantial
number
of beta-2
adrenoceptors
in the human
heart,
and it is known
that
beta-2
adrenoceptor
stimulation
increases
sinus
node frequency.7
the greater
potency
of atenolol
in
reducing
 xxxd2401xxx -induced
tachycardia
cannot,
however,
be attributed
to blockade
of beta-2
receptors because
atenolol
is more
selective
for beta-i
adrenoceptors
than
 xxxd329xxx ,
so that the difference remains
unexplained.
the authors
themselves
concluded
from
their
study:
though
the beta-adrenergic
effect
of
atenolol
as measured
by ability
to reduce
isoproter“.

beta

blocker

enol-induced
tachycardia
was shown
to be greater
than that of  xxxd329xxx ,
both drugs
reduced
systolic
blood
pressure
to a similar
degree.
diastolic
blood
pressure
was, however,
reduced
significantly
more
by  xxxd329xxx 
when
compared
with
atenolol.
this
finding
may be explained
by the increase
in peripheral vascular
resistance
observed
during
atenolol
therapy
when
compared
with  xxxd329xxx .
with
the
latter
drug the pvr value
showed
a significant
decrease
from baseline.”32
thus
the general
conclusion
of the authors
that
the action
of  xxxd329xxx 
was best explained
as involving
a short-lived
period
of alpha-adrenergic agonism
followed
by vasodilatory
effects
consistent with additional
alpha-antagonism
fits extremely
well with all the other evidence
reviewed
in
this report.

assessment

to what
extent
can the laboratory
investigations
provide
a satisfactory
explanation
for the human
data?
evidence
for the affinity
of  xxxd329xxx 
for
aipha-adrenoceptors
has been
obtained
in preparations of rat brain
membranes
(> noradrenaline),
in
strips
of aorta (antagonist),
and in pithed
rats (acute
pressor
action
and potentiation
of the pressor
action
of noradrenaline
and phenylephrine).
if  xxxd329xxx 
is a partial
agonist
 xxxd2216xxx -adrenoceptors,
especially
alpha-2
receptors,
the unique
additional
actions
of
 xxxd329xxx 
in comparison
with
other
beta blockers
can be understood.
heusch
et al33 showed
that vasoconstriction
in the myocardial
microcirculation
distal to a coronary
artery
stenosis
is mediated
by
alpha-2
adrenoceptors.
the increase
in the perfusion
of the subendocardium
in an ischemic
zone in anesthetized
dogs after administration
of bevantolop6’17
could
be due to relief
from alpha-2
adrenoceptormediated
vasoconstriction
because
it is known
that
large amounts
of noradrenaline
are released
during
ischemia
and reperfusion.
the absence
of reports
of
cold extremities
during
treatment
with  xxxd329xxx ,
in contrast
to the frequent
occurrence
of this phenomenon
during
treatment
with other beta blockers,
could
be due to an alpha-adrenergic
antagonism
by
 xxxd329xxx 
to the high sympathetic
vasoconstrictor
tone normally
experienced
during
beta blockade
as
a reflex
response
to reduced
cardiac
output
and
lower
blood
pressure.
on the other
hand,
in situations in which
normal
sympathetic
traffic
is low, as
in the release
of growth
hormone
from the brain,
the
alpha-adrenoceptor
agonist
action
of  xxxd329xxx 
may
predominate,
accounting
for the rise in plasma
growth-hormone
levels.
in addition,
as was pre-

459

vaughan

williams

viously
suggested,6
 xxxd329xxx 
may
have
central
alpha-adrenoceptor
antagonist
action
leading
to reduced
output
of sympathetic
vasoconstrictor
tone, a
hypothesis
with which
dollery’s
evidence
is consistent.31
in conclusion,
 xxxd329xxx 
clearly
provides
an effective
once-a-day
therapy
for hypertension
and angina pectoris,
with remarkably
few side effects
and
without
the disadvantage
of increased
peripheral
vascular
resistance
(pvr); on the contrary,
pvr is
reduced
in the human
microcirculation.
furthermore,
 xxxd329xxx 
improves
the perfusion
of the endocardium
in the ischemic
zone after coronary
occlusion
and has a favorable
effect
on the serum
hdl/ldl
cholesterol
ratio.
