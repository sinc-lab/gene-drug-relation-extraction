summary
abstract

 xxxd3135xxx  is an orally active serotonin 5-ht1 receptor agonist that potently and
selectively binds to  xxxg1109xxx /1d subtypes.
earlier clinical trials demonstrated that  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg is more effective
than placebo at providing pain relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated
symptoms of migraine, normalising functional ability and improving patient
quality of life, and showed that  xxxd3135xxx  provides faster freedom from pain and
reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan.
more recently,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was shown to be more effective than
 xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg at producing a pain-free state 2 hours
postdose. furthermore, compared with naratriptan, significantly more patients
who received  xxxd3135xxx  were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards.
the number of patients with normal functional ability at 2 hours was significantly
higher after  xxxd3135xxx  than after naratriptan or  xxxd3562xxx .  xxxd3135xxx  was also
generally more effective than  xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan at relieving migraineassociated symptoms.
 xxxd3135xxx  is generally well tolerated and adverse events are usually mild and
transient. the most common adverse events associated with  xxxd3135xxx  in recent
randomised trials were asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea. there
was a trend towards a lower incidence of adverse events with  xxxd3135xxx  compared
with  xxxd3562xxx  (31.2 vs 38.8%). however,  xxxd3135xxx  was associated with a
significantly higher incidence of adverse events than naratriptan (39 vs 29%). the
incidence of chest pain was similar after the administration of  xxxd3135xxx ,
 xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan (2 to 4%).
conclusion:  xxxd3135xxx  is an effective drug for the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine. oral  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg have shown greater efficacy
than placebo in providing pain relief, an absence of pain, relief from associated
symptoms, normal functional ability and an improvement in patient quality of
life. earlier results showed that  xxxd3135xxx  provides faster freedom from pain and
reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral sumatriptan. more recent studies have
shown that  xxxd3135xxx  10mg provides faster pain relief and a higher percentage
of patients with an absence of pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than
naratriptan 2.5mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg. the efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  is retained
when used in the long term and the drug is generally well tolerated. although
well designed studies comparing  xxxd3135xxx  with almotriptan,  xxxd1976xxx  and
frovatriptan would further define the position of  xxxd3135xxx , current data suggest

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

 xxxd3135xxx  should be considered as a first-line treatment option in the management
of migraine.
pharmacodynamic
profile

 xxxd3135xxx  is an orally active serotonin 5-ht1 receptor agonist that potently and
selectively binds to  xxxg1109xxx /1d subtypes.
 xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  induce vasoconstriction and reduce
(albeit to a different extent) compliance of conduit arteries, suggesting that 5ht1b/1d agonists should be used with caution in patients with an increased risk
for cardiovascular events. in a double-blind study in 16 patients with migraine,
 xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  caused similar decreases in the diameter
of the carotid and brachial arteries (by about 4 to 10%); there were no significant
differences between active treatments. distension, vascular resistance, and isobaric cross-sectional compliance of the carotid artery were not affected by any of
the active drugs. unlike sumatriptan or  xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx  did not significantly affect the isobaric compliance of the brachial artery.  xxxd3135xxx  had no
effect on the diameter or vascular resistance of the temporal artery.
 xxxd3135xxx  generally produces only small and transient increases in bp and
does not affect heart rate or the increases in heart rate or bp in response to
sympathetic stimulation. however,  xxxd3135xxx  is contraindicated in patients with
uncontrolled hypertension.
in guinea pigs, intravenous  xxxd3135xxx  0.01 to 1 mg/kg dose-dependently inhibited electrically stimulated neurogenic dural vasodilation, but had no effect
on rat-alpha -calcitonin gene-related peptide (alphacgrp)-induced vasodilation, indicating that  xxxd3135xxx  has an inhibitory action on the release of cgrp via an action
at receptors located on the trigeminal sensory fibres.
in rats, intravenous  xxxd3135xxx  100 and 1000 mu g/kg inhibited dural plasma
protein extravasation induced by electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion
(by about 57 and 89%).  xxxd3135xxx  inhibited electrically induced central nociceptive neurotransmission, suggesting a central antinociceptive effect.
 xxxd3135xxx  20 to 60mg does not affect serum prolactin concentrations, and
produces transient increases in growth hormone concentrations similar to those
seen after sumatriptan 100mg.

pharmacokinetic profile

the bioavailability of  xxxd3135xxx  after oral administration is about 45%. maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time
curve (auc) values for  xxxd3135xxx  were generally dose-proportional after singledose  xxxd3135xxx  5 to 60mg. studies evaluating single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg in
healthy volunteers showed cmax and auc values of between 17.7 and 32.1 mug/l
and 49.6 and 97.0 mu g • h/l, respectively. the mean time to achieve cmax (tmax)
was 0.7 to 1.5 hours after  xxxd3135xxx  10mg; the elimination half-life (t1⁄2) was 1.7
to 2.6 hours.
after multiple-dose  xxxd3135xxx  (10mg every 2 hours for three doses on 4 consecutive days), the auc was approximately 3-fold higher, cmax was 2-fold higher
and tmax was 5-fold higher than after single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg; t1⁄2 and the rate
of renal clearance (clr) were not significantly affected.
cmax, auc, tmax and t1⁄2 values after single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg in healthy
elderly volunteers (aged between 65 and 78 years) were similar to those found in
younger adults; however, clr was somewhat lower in the elderly (11.8 vs 17.6
l/h).
 xxxd3135xxx  is predominantly metabolised by  xxxg1357xxx  (mao-a)
in the liver; the major metabolites are triazolomethyl- xxxd2348xxx  and

 xxxd3135xxx -n-oxide (both inactive). the minor metabolite n-monodesmethylrizatriptan is active at  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors. 82.4 and 15.2% of an administered
dose of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg is excreted in the urine and faeces, predominantly within
the first 24 hours.
coadministration of  xxxd3135xxx  with moclobemide (which is contraindicated)
or propranolol (but not  xxxd2689xxx  or metoprolol) causes an increase in plasma concentrations of  xxxd3135xxx ; patients receiving propranolol should be prescribed
 xxxd3135xxx  5mg. results from a study in women taking oral contraceptives
showed that  xxxd3135xxx  has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd2054xxx 
or  xxxd2751xxx  ( xxxd2751xxx ).
therapeutic efficacy

the efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  [standard tablets and orally disintegrating tablets (wafers)] in the treatment of migraine has been demonstrated in large well designed,
placebo-controlled studies and comparative trials with oral sumatriptan,
 xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan.
earlier comparative studies with sumatriptan demonstrated that at 2 hours
postdose,  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg were more effective than sumatriptan 25 and
100mg, respectively, at producing a pain free state, and that  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was
more effective than sumatriptan 25mg at providing pain relief.  xxxd3135xxx  5 or
10mg also provided faster freedom from pain than sumatriptan 25 to 100mg.
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg has also been shown to be more effective than  xxxd3135xxx  5mg
at providing freedom from pain within 2 hours of the dose.
more recent randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies showed
that more patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg for the acute treatment of a
single migraine attack were free of pain 2 hours postdose than patients who
received  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg. compared with  xxxd3562xxx 
recipients, more  xxxd3135xxx  recipients had pain relief after 1 hour (but not at 2
hours). compared with naratriptan recipients, more patients who received
 xxxd3135xxx  were pain free or had pain relief from 1 hour onwards. more patients
receiving  xxxd3135xxx  were likely to be free of pain or experience pain relief sooner
than patients receiving naratriptan [odds ratios (ors) 2.68 and 1.62] but not with
 xxxd3562xxx  (1.26 and 1.22).
in the earlier comparative studies with sumatriptan, 32 to 48% of patients
receiving  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg were functioning normally 2 hours postdose,
compared with 33 to 43% of sumatriptan 25 to 100mg recipients. in one trial,
more patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg had normal functional ability at 2
hours than those who received sumatriptan 100mg or  xxxd3135xxx  5mg. the effects
of  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg at 2 hours on most migraine associated symptoms, except
nausea, were similar to the respective comparative doses of sumatriptan. the
incidence of nausea at 2 hours was lower after  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg than after
sumatriptan 100mg in one study. in another trial, the incidence of nausea at 2
hours was lower when  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was compared with sumatriptan 25mg, but
not when  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was compared with sumatriptan 50mg.
in more recent studies, the number of patients with normal functional ability
at 2 hours was higher after  xxxd3135xxx  than after naratriptan or  xxxd3562xxx . compared with  xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd3135xxx  was associated with a lower incidence of
nausea or photophobia at 2 hours.  xxxd3135xxx  was associated with a lower incidence of photophobia or phonophobia than naratriptan at 2 hours. the incidence
of migraine recurrence within 24 hours of the initial dose was similar among
patients treated with  xxxd3135xxx  or  xxxd3562xxx , but lower with naratriptan. a

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

retrospective analysis of five double-blind trials concluded that  xxxd3135xxx  10mg
was more effective than oral sumatriptan 25, 50 or 100mg or naratriptan 2.5mg,
but not  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg, at eliminating nausea within 2 hours of a migraine
attack in patients with nausea at baseline. in another retrospective analysis of five
clinical trials that compared the same treatment regimens, more  xxxd3135xxx  recipients had a 24-hour sustained pain-free response than patients who received
sumatriptan 25 or 50mg, naratriptan or  xxxd3562xxx . although 24-hour sustained
pain-free rates were higher in  xxxd3135xxx  recipients than in sumatriptan 100mg
recipients, the difference did not achieve statistical significance.
in a large noncomparative trial involving 25 501 evaluable patients who
treated up to three attacks, the proportion of patients who reported feeling the
first effects (a definition of pain relief was not provided) of  xxxd3135xxx  within 30
minutes during the first and third attacks was 32.3 and 43.9%. corresponding
values for pain relief between 30 minutes and 1 hour were 43.1 and 38.5%.
the efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  was not affected by long-term administration. in a
nonblind extension study, 458 patients with migraine treated multiple attacks (a
total of 8229) with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg or usual therapy [85% of patients in the
usual therapy group used sumatriptan (dose not specified) either alone or in combination with other agents to treat most of the attacks (77%)] over a 6-month
period. the median percentage of attacks in which  xxxd3135xxx  10mg recipients
reported pain relief or an absence of pain 2 hours after the dose was 82 and 46%;
corresponding values among recipients of  xxxd3135xxx  5mg (72 and 25%) or usual
therapy (73 and 30%) were lower. ors showed  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was more likely
to provide pain relief or an absence of pain at 2 hours than  xxxd3135xxx  5mg (1.60
and 1.93) or usual therapy (1.63 and 1.50).
in a meta-analysis of 53 double-blind clinical trials (involving  xxxd3135xxx ,
sumatriptan,  xxxd1976xxx , almotriptan,  xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan),  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg,  xxxd1976xxx  80mg and  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg were better at providing headache
relief within 2 hours than sumatriptan 100mg, against which all the triptans were
compared. although headache recurrence rates were higher with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or
10mg than with sumatriptan 100mg, 24-hour sustained pain-free rates were
higher with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg, almotriptan 12.5mg and  xxxd1976xxx  80mg than with
sumatriptan 100mg. in an analysis of multiple-attack studies (data were not available for  xxxd3135xxx  5mg, sumatriptan 25 or 50mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5 or 5mg)
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was shown to provide the highest consistent therapeutic response when compared with sumatriptan 100mg.
in another meta-analysis of 28 clinical trials, in which the primary efficacy
variable analysed was the proportion of patients who were pain free at 2 hours,
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was the only  xxxd3263xxx  associated with a higher therapeutic gain
than oral sumatriptan 100mg, against which all the studied triptans (oral
sumatriptan 50mg,  xxxd3562xxx  2.5 or 5mg, naratriptan 2.5mg,  xxxd1976xxx  20, 40
or 80mg or almotriptan 12.5mg) were compared.
two retrospective analyses have demonstrated that  xxxd3135xxx  is effective in
the treatment of menstrual migraine (i.e. migraine that is exacerbated around the
time of menses).  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg were more effective than placebo at
relieving a single migraine attack that occurred within 3 days of menstruation
according to a retrospective subgroup analysis of two double-blind studies. furthermore, a retrospective analysis of a long-term extension study showed
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg to be as effective in the treatment of multiple menstrually asso© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

ciated migraine attacks as it was in the treatment of multiple nonmenstrual attacks.
tolerability

 xxxd3135xxx  is generally well tolerated and adverse events are usually mild and
transient. earlier studies showed that the incidence of drug-related adverse events
in patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg or oral sumatriptan 25 or 50mg
were similar, but lower with both doses of  xxxd3135xxx  than with sumatriptan
100mg, and that the most common adverse events associated with  xxxd3135xxx  were
cns- or gastrointestinal-related.
more recent studies showed that  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was also well tolerated in
the two double-blind trials with  xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan. the most common
adverse events associated with  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan were cnsor gastrointestinal-related, and included asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence
and nausea. these adverse events were, however, reported by relatively small
percentages of patients (≤8%). there was a trend towards a lower incidence of
adverse events with  xxxd3135xxx  compared with  xxxd3562xxx  (31.2 vs 38.8%).
however,  xxxd3135xxx  was associated with a higher incidence of adverse events
than naratriptan (39 vs 29%).
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was well tolerated in a large noncomparative study in
33 147 patients who treated up to three moderate or severe migraine attacks. 304
patients (0.9%) reported at least one adverse event. the most frequent were dizziness, asthenia/fatigue and nausea which occurred in 0.21, 0.17 and 0.11% of
patients, respectively.
in the two recent double-blind studies, the incidence of chest pain (a feeling
of tightness or pressure in the chest) was similar after the administration of
 xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan (2 to 4%). in the noncomparative study in
33 147 patients, chest pain was reported by only 0.05% of patients.
the incidence of adverse events (whether related to treatment or not) among
patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg or usual therapy for the treatment of
multiple migraine attacks over a 6-month period was similar (53, 60 and 66%,
respectively). the incidence of adverse events thought to be drug-related was
higher after  xxxd3135xxx  10mg than after  xxxd3135xxx  5mg (31 vs 20%) but similar
to that after usual therapy (26%).

dosage and
administration

 xxxd3135xxx  is indicated for the treatment of migraine with or without aura in
adults. it is available in 5 or 10mg doses in standard tablet form or as orally
disintegrating tablets (wafers).
the recommended initial dose is 5 or 10mg, and dose selection should be made
on a per patient basis. if required, additional doses for headache recurrence should
be separated by at least 2 hours; no more than 30mg should be taken during a
24-hour period. the use of  xxxd3135xxx  for the treatment of more than four migraines in a 30-day period has not been established. dose adjustments based
solely on age are not considered necessary in elderly patients.
 xxxd3135xxx , like all  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists, is contraindicated in patients
with ischaemic heart disease, any other significant underlying cardiovascular
disease, uncontrolled hypertension or hemiplegic or basilar migraine. it should
be used with caution in patients on dialysis, with moderate hepatic impairment
or those reporting signs or symptoms of angina.
coadministration of  xxxd3135xxx  with mao inhibitors (within 2 weeks), ergot
derivatives or other  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists (within 24 hours) is contraindicated. coadministration with propranolol increases plasma concentrations of

 xxxd3135xxx  by 75%; therefore patients receiving propranolol should be prescribed
 xxxd3135xxx  5mg. observation of patients is advised if  xxxd3135xxx  is coadministered
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, as symptoms of the serotonin syndrome have been reported.

1. overview of migraine
migraine is a chronic and incapacitating neurological disorder that affects more than 10% of the
western population.[1] a recent epidemiological
study in the us[2] showed that 18.2% of females
and 6.5% of males aged ≥12 years experienced migraine as defined by the international headache
society (ihs). approximately 20 to 30% of patients with migraine experience attacks that are
preceded or accompanied by transient focal neurological symptoms (migraine with aura).[3-6] table
i summarises the symptoms of ihs-defined migraine with or without aura. typical features which
differentiate migraine attacks from tension-type
headaches include nausea, vomiting, photophobia
and phonophobia.[4]
although the specific cause of migraine is currently unknown, the mechanisms involved in the
pathophysiology of migraine are better undertable i. summary of the international headache society description
of migraine with or without aura[6]
migraine without auraa
an idiopathic, recurring headache disorder which manifests as
attacks lasting from 4 to 72 hours
typical characteristics include a pulsating headache of moderate
to severe intensity at a unilateral location which is aggravated by
routine physical activity, and is associated with nausea,
photophobia and phonophobia
migraine with aurab
an idiopathic, recurring disorder which manifests as attacks of
neurological symptoms located in the cerebral cortex or brain
stem. it usually gradually develops over a period of 5 to 20
minutes and typically lasts <60 minutes
headache, nausea and/or photophobia can directly follow the
neurological aura symptoms or develop <1 hour later. the
headache usually lasts between 4 and 72 hours, but may be
absent

stood, and have been recently reviewed elsewhere.[4,7-9] briefly, it has been suggested that migraine involves the dysfunction of brain-stem pathways that normally modulate sensory output.[4]
activation of the trigemino-vascular system results in the release of vasoactive neuropeptides
[e.g.  xxxg2240xxx , calcitonin gene-related peptide
(cgrp) and  xxxg2240xxx ] from the trigeminal
neurons in the dura mater which, in the periphery,
can cause perivascular inflammation and further
vasodilation.[7,10-12] furthermore, vasodilation of
intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, particularly those supplying the dura mater, may also contribute to migraine pain.[8] the nausea and vomiting associated with migraine are thought to result
from activation of central nociceptive sensory neurons that project to autonomic brain-stem nuclei
and higher subcortical and cortical pain processing
centres.[8]
an imbalance in the concentrations of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-ht) is implicated in the
aetiology of migraine.[13,14] serotonin mediates trigeminal neuronal firing and vasoconstriction by
indirectly activating  xxxg1109xxx  and  xxxg1110xxx  receptor
subtypes.[15] as such,  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists
are commonly used for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. there are three suggested sites of
action for  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists: constriction of intracranial extracerebral blood vessels, peripheral trigeminal nerve inhibition and inhibition
of central nociceptive neurotransmission.[7]
sumatriptan was the first selective  xxxg1109xxx /1d
agonist for the treatment of acute migraine attacks.
subsequently, there have been a number of ‘second
generation’ selective  xxxg1109xxx /1d agonists (triptans)
introduced into the armamentarium, one of which
is  xxxd3135xxx  (figure 1).
the use of  xxxd3135xxx  for the acute treatment of
migraine has been reviewed previously in
drugs.[17] since then, further studies have condrugs 2002; 62 (10)

firmed and extended earlier knowledge of the clinical role of the drug. this review, therefore, updates the use of  xxxd3135xxx  in the treatment of migraine with or without aura. key information
included in the earlier review is also mentioned,
where appropriate.
2. pharmacodynamic profile
serotonin receptors are grouped into seven subfamilies (5-ht1 to 5-ht7) and 14 subtypes which
have different anatomical locations.[7] substantial
expression of vasoconstrictor  xxxg1109xxx  receptors
has been found in the smooth muscle of meningeal

blood vessels.[18] because of the abnormal vasodilation that occurs during migraine,[19] these receptors are considered a good target for the reversal of
such vasodilation.[7] however,  xxxg1109xxx  receptors
are also found in coronary arteries, although in relatively small concentrations.[20] studies of receptor subtypes in human neurons have demonstrated
that  xxxg1110xxx  receptors are expressed on both the
peripheral and central terminals of the trigeminal
ganglia.[21,22] furthermore, a recent study has
shown that  xxxg1109xxx  receptors are also expressed on
human trigeminal neurons.[23]  xxxg1110xxx  receptors
have also been localised to the nucleus of the
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

tractus solitaris, which mediates the nausea and
vomiting associated with central pain transmission.[7] the  xxxg1110xxx  receptor functions as an autoreceptor and inhibits the release of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine
(noradrenaline) and acetylcholine, and also inhibits vasoactive neuropeptide release within the
trigemino-vascular system.[7,15,24]
 xxxd3135xxx  is an agonist at  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors.
in a radioligand binding study using human-cloned
receptors expressed in c6 glial cell lines,[7,25]
 xxxd3135xxx  potently bound to  xxxg1109xxx  and  xxxg1110xxx 
receptors [concentration required for 50% inhibition (ic50) = 7 and 2 nmol/l, respectively)]. there
are no major differences between the triptans in
affinities at the  xxxg1109xxx  and  xxxg1110xxx  receptors.[26]
 xxxd3135xxx  has weak affinity for the 5-ht1a, 5ht1e and  xxxg1112xxx  receptor subtypes and the 5-ht7
receptor, and no significant affinity for 5-ht2, 5ht3, alpha- and beta-adrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic, muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptors.[27]
2.1 vascular effects

in vitro studies examining the vascular effects
of  xxxd3135xxx  were discussed in detail in the previous review[17] and are summarised in table ii.
recent results from a randomised, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover
study in 16 patients with migraine demonstrated
that  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  induce vasoconstriction and reduce (albeit to a different extent) compliance of conduit arteries, suggesting that  xxxg1109xxx /1d agonists should be used
with caution in patients with an increased risk for
cardiovascular events.[28] patients received a single dose of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg, sumatriptan 50mg,
 xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg or placebo followed by a washout period of ≥1 week before crossing over to a
different treatment. ultrasonography measurements began 1.5 hours after administration of the
drug and were performed at the common carotid
artery, the superficial temporal artery and the brachial artery. isobaric vessel wall properties [distensibility coefficient (dciso) and cross-sectional

compliance (cciso)] were calculated over a predefined pressure interval of 85 to 95mm hg to ensure that between-treatment differences in vessel
wall properties were drug-related. comparisons
were made between measurements taken after the
administration of placebo and active drug.
compared with placebo,  xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  caused significant decreases in the diameter of the carotid and brachial
arteries (by about 4 to 10%, p < 0.05 for each drug
vs placebo); there were no significant differences
between active treatments. distension, vascular resistance, dciso or cciso of the carotid artery were
not significantly affected by any of the active
drugs. sumatriptan and  xxxd3562xxx  significantly
reduced the cciso of the brachial artery by 17 and
31% (p = 0.02 and 0.003 vs placebo); although
 xxxd3135xxx  caused a 19% reduction, this did not
reach statistical significance (p = 0.08).  xxxd3562xxx  decreased brachial artery cciso to a significantly greater extent than sumatriptan (p = 0.04).
table ii. summary of results from in vitro studies examining the
vascular effects of  xxxd3135xxx , as reviewed by dooley and faulds[17]
at concentrations higher than those observed after therapeutic
doses (>1000 nmol/l),  xxxd3135xxx  produced a greater emax in
isolated middle human meningeal artery segments than
sumatriptan (132.6 vs 105.3%, p < 0.05). ec50 occurred at
similar and clinically relevant concentrations of both drugs (90 vs
71 nmol/l)[29]

iotan two studies, emax for  xxxd3135xxx  (22.2[30] or 32.5%[31]) in
isolated coronary artery segments from patients undergoing
cardiac transplant for end-stage heart failure was lower than for
sumatriptan (43.7 or 57.6%; p < 0.001 and < 0.05), but was
similar to sumatriptan in isolated coronary artery segments from
patients without cardiac disorders (10 vs 14%)[20]
ec50 occurred at similar concentrations of  xxxd3135xxx  or
sumatriptan in isolated coronary artery segments from patients
with end-stage liver failure (550 to 1020 nmol/l), but was lower
for  xxxd3135xxx  than for sumatriptan in isolated coronary artery
segments from patients without cardiac disorders (448 vs 803
nmol/l, p < 0.05)[20,30,31]
the ratio of the cmax of single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg to the ec50
in human coronary arteries was about 1:5.5, indicating that
 xxxd3135xxx  is unlikely to cause significant coronary artery
vasoconstriction in patients without coronary artery disease;
similar results were found for sumatriptan[20]

none of the drugs significantly affected vascular
resistance of the brachial artery. compared with
placebo,  xxxd3562xxx , but not  xxxd3135xxx  or
sumatriptan, significantly (p < 0.001) decreased
the diameter of the temporal artery. however, vascular resistance of the temporal artery was significantly increased with  xxxd3562xxx  (by 40%, p <
0.05) and sumatriptan (by 26%, p < 0.05), but not
with  xxxd3135xxx  (17%), compared with placebo; the
difference between  xxxd3562xxx  and  xxxd3135xxx 
was significant (p = 0.04).[28]
2.2 neurogenic effects

as reviewed by dooley and faulds,[17]  xxxd3135xxx  3 or 10 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.05 vs
control) inhibited electrically stimulated vasodilation of the dural blood vessels in rats (by about 40
and 51%, respectively) but not vasodilation induced by exogenously administered neuropeptides.
since the previous review, a study in guinea
pigs (in which the distribution and pharmacology
of  xxxg1110xxx  receptors within the trigemino-vascular
system are thought to be more similar to humans
than those of rats) demonstrated that treatment
with intravenous  xxxd3135xxx  0.01 to 1 mg/kg before
electrical stimulation of the cranial window dosedependently inhibited neurogenic dural vasodilation compared with vehicle.[32] a maximum inhibition of 62% was achieved after administration of
 xxxd3135xxx  1 mg/kg (p < 0.05 vs vehicle). however,
 xxxd3135xxx  1 mg/kg had no effect on the vasodilation evoked by intravenous administration of the
cgrp receptor agonist rat-alphacgrp 1 mug/kg, indicating that  xxxd3135xxx  prevents the release of
cgrp via an action at receptors located on the trigeminal sensory fibres.[32]
in rats,  xxxd3135xxx  significantly inhibited dural
plasma protein extravasation induced by electrical
stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion.[33] the animals were treated with intravenous  xxxd3135xxx  1 to
1000 mug/kg or vehicle prior to electrical stimulation of the right trigeminal ganglion. the calculated ratio of extravasation in the stimulated to unstimulated side was about 2=: 1 in control animals.

wellington & plosker

 xxxd3135xxx  100 and 1000 mug/kg inhibited dural extravasation by about 57 and 89% (p < 0.005 for
both doses vs vehicle). the concentration required
to produce half the maximum inhibition was 31
mug/kg.
2.3 central antinociceptive effects

in a study in rats,[34]  xxxd3135xxx  dose-dependently inhibited central nociceptive neurotransmission induced by electrical stimulation of the dura
mater. in rats with an intact blood-brain barrier,
action potentials were induced in trigeminal neurons by electrical stimulation of the middle meningeal artery in the dura mater; cumulative intravenous doses of  xxxd3135xxx  0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg or
saline were then administered  xxxd1891xxx -minute intervals.  xxxd3135xxx  1 and 3 mg/kg caused significant
inhibition of induced neural response (52 and 63%)
compared with responses in control animals (p <
0.05 and 0.005). the mean maximum level of inhibition (63% after  xxxd3135xxx  3 mg/kg) occurred
at 19 minutes.
2.4 haemodynamic effects

the effects of  xxxd3135xxx  on bp are generally
small and transient, and the drug does not affect
heart rate or the increases in heart rate or bp in
response to sympathetic stimulation (reviewed by
dooley and faulds).[17] results from studies evaluating the effects of oral  xxxd3135xxx  on bp and
heart rate in healthy volunteers[35-37] or patients
with controlled hypertension[38] were reviewed in
detail in the previous review and, therefore, will be
only briefly overviewed here.
in healthy volunteers, single-dose  xxxd3135xxx 
0.5 to 80mg generally did not significantly alter
heart rate.[35] after  xxxd3135xxx  10 or 15mg or placebo, increases in heart rate or diastolic bp induced by a cold pressor test were similar.[36] multiple-dose  xxxd3135xxx  (10mg every 2 hours for three
doses on 4 consecutive days) was associated with
a slight increase in diastolic bp (about 5mm hg)
which was significantly greater than that with placebo only on the first day (p < 0.01).[37]
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

in patients with controlled hypertension,[38]
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was associated with only small
transient increases in diastolic bp; a 2.4mm hg
increase at 2 hours postdose was the only significant increase noted (p = 0.031). the use of
 xxxd3135xxx , as with other  xxxg1109xxx /1d agonists, is
contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled hypertension (section 6).
2.5 effects on growth hormone and
prolactin concentrations

in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in
13 healthy volunteers, neither single-dose oral
 xxxd3135xxx  20 to 60mg nor sumatriptan 100mg affected serum prolactin concentrations. however,
compared with baseline values, similar transient
increases in serum growth hormone concentrations
were observed after each drug was taken; the median maximum plasma concentration (cmax) of
growth hormone after  xxxd3135xxx  20 to 60mg or
sumatriptan 100mg was 12.3 and 9.6 mu/l.[35]
3. pharmacokinetic profile
the pharmacokinetic properties of oral or intravenous  xxxd3135xxx  in healthy volunteers have been
reviewed previously.[16,17,26,39,40] in the previous
review in drugs,[17] the pharmacokinetics of oral
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg in adolescents with migraine
were also briefly discussed. this section provides
a general overview of pharmacokinetic data for
oral  xxxd3135xxx  tablets, supplemented with results
from more recent studies, notably one that investigated the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3135xxx  in elderly volunteers,[41] and one that evaluated the effects of  xxxd3135xxx  on the pharmacokinetics of oral
contraceptives.[42] table iii summarises the pharmacokinetic properties of single- or multiple-dose
oral  xxxd3135xxx  10mg in healthy male and female
volunteers.
3.1 absorption and distribution

oral  xxxd3135xxx  is readily absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract (≈90%) but overall bioavailability is about 45%,[27,43] indicating substantial

first-pass metabolism (section 3.2).[44] the mean
cmax and area under the plasma concentration-time
curve (auc) of  xxxd3135xxx  increases in a generally
dose-proportional manner after single-dose
 xxxd3135xxx  5 to 60mg (7.8 to 90 mug/l and 17.4 to
394.5 mug • =h/l).[35] the mean time to cmax (tmax)
after single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  2.5 to 60mg ranged
from 0.7 to 2.1 hours.[35,37,45,46] in a study in 16
healthy volunteers,  xxxd3135xxx  was reported to
have a faster rate of absorption than oral sumatriptan; the tmax of  xxxd3135xxx  (5 to 60mg) was significantly lower than that of sumatriptan 100mg
(median 1.3 vs 2.5 hours, p < 0.001).[35] the bioavailability and cmax of  xxxd3135xxx  are similar after
administration of the tablet or wafer form, but tmax
is slightly longer with the wafer formulation (1.6
to 2.5 hours).[27]  xxxd3135xxx  is minimally bound to
plasma proteins (14%).[27]
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in
36 healthy volunteers (18 males), the pharmacokinetics of single- and multiple-dose  xxxd3135xxx  were
evaluated.[37] volunteers received single-dose
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg (n = 24) or placebo (n = 12) on
day 1, followed by  xxxd3135xxx  10mg or placebo every 2 hours for three doses on days 3 to 6. following multiple doses, the auc was approximately
3-fold higher (201.8 vs 63.5 mug • h/l), the cmax
was 2-fold higher (37.0 vs 19.6 mug/l) and the tmax
5-fold higher (4.8 vs 0.9h) than after the single
dose. similar trends were observed for nmonodesmethylrizatriptan, the minor active metabolite. the auc of  xxxd3135xxx  was ≈8-fold higher

than n-monodesmethyl after both single and multiple doses. there were no significant betweengender differences in any of the parameters measured in this study.[37]
compared with administration in a fasting state,
administration of single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  40mg after food increased the auc (330 vs 397 mug • h/l,
p = 0.01) and increased tmax (1.6 vs 2.9h, p = 0.04).
however, cmax was not significantly affected by
the presence of food (77 vs 72 mug/l).[47]
in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in
which 20 healthy elderly volunteers (aged between
65 and 78 years) received single-dose  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg (n = 16) or placebo (n = 4), the pharmacokinetics of single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg were similar
to those reported elsewhere for younger adults.[41]
the geometric means of the cmax and auc values of  xxxd3135xxx  (21.9 mug/l and 77.7 mug • h/l)
in the elderly patients were not significantly different from those in young adults [24.7 mug/l and
81.3 mug • h/l (geometric means pooled from six
previous studies in patients who received oral
 xxxd3135xxx  5, 10 or 15mg)] and were reached in an
average 1.2 hours. furthermore, there were no between-gender differences in any of the parameters
measured.
the auc and cmax of  xxxd3135xxx  after singledose administration of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg to 12 adolescents with migraine were similar to values obtained from a pooled population of 115 healthy
adults.[48] the geometric mean ratios (adolescents/adults) for auc and cmax were 1.12 [90%
confidence interval (ci) 0.80 to 1.57] and 1.19
(90% ci 0.76 to 1.87), respectively; however, the
confidence intervals fall outside the equivalence
range.
3.2 metabolism and elimination

 xxxd3135xxx  undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by  xxxg1357xxx  (mao-a), primarily to inactive metabolites.[41] in a study in six
healthy volunteers administered 14c-labelled
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg,[37] 82.4% of the radioactivity
was excreted in the urine, the majority of which
was excreted during the first 24 hours after the

dose; minor amounts were excreted in the faeces
(15.2%). fourteen percent of the administered
dose was excreted as unchanged drug (ue); 51.0
and 2.3% of the dose was excreted as triazolomethyl- xxxd2348xxx  and  xxxd3135xxx -n-oxide,
respectively. both of these metabolites are inactive
at  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptors. further minor metabolites
of  xxxd3135xxx  include n-monodesmethylrizatriptan
(the only active metabolite of  xxxd3135xxx ), ndidesmethylrizatriptan, 6-hydroxyrizatriptan and
6-hydroxyrizatriptan sulphate.[37,44]
the mean elimination half-life (t1⁄2) of oral
 xxxd3135xxx  2.5 to 60mg in both males and females
is between 1.7 and 2.6 hours.[35,37,41,43,44,46,48,49]
following single-dose administration, the renal
clearance rate (clr) of oral  xxxd3135xxx  2.5 to 60mg
ranges between 11.0 and 27.2 l/h.[35,37,44-46]
after multiple doses of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (every
2 hours for three doses for 4 days), the t1⁄2 was 2.07
hours, compared with 2.12 hours after single-dose
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg. clr after multiple-dose administration was 11.0 l/h, compared with 12.2 l/h after the single dose.[37]
in a study in healthy elderly volunteers who received single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (section
3.1),[41] the mean t1⁄2 (2.41h) was similar to that
seen in younger adults. compared with arithmetic
mean values calculated from pooled results from
other studies in young patients who received oral
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg, clr (17.6 vs 11.8 l/h) and ue
(12.7 vs 9.3%) in the elderly appeared lower; statistical analyses were not performed.

coadministration of moclobemide (an mao-a
inhibitor) with  xxxd3135xxx  caused a significant
increase in the auc and c max of both  xxxd3135xxx 
and its active metabolite n-monodesmethylrizatriptan.[49] in a randomised, double-blind,
crossover study, 12 healthy volunteers received
moclobemide 450 mg/day in three divided doses or
placebo for 4 days. on the fourth day, all patients
received single-dose  xxxd3135xxx  10mg. the mean
cmax of  xxxd3135xxx  was 1.4-fold (90% ci 1.1 to 1.8)
higher with moclobemide than with placebo; the
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

mean auc was 2.2-fold (90% ci 1.9 to 2.5) higher
with moclobemide than with placebo. furthermore, during concomitant treatment with
moclobemide, both the tmax (2.4 vs 1.5h, p < 0.05)
and t1⁄2 (2.3 vs 1.7h, p < 0.05) of  xxxd3135xxx  were
significantly higher than during coadministration
with placebo. the pharmacokinetics of nmonodesmethylrizatriptan were also affected by
moclobemide, although to a greater degree; the
mean auc increased 5.3-fold, whereas cmax increased 2.6-fold. because n-monodesmethylrizatriptan is an approximately twice as potent 5ht1b/1d agonist as  xxxd3135xxx , the increase in
plasma metabolite to drug concentration could result in a nearly 3-fold increase in active  xxxg1109xxx /1d
agonist in the blood.[49]
in a report of four double-blind studies in 51
healthy volunteers,[43] coadministration of  xxxd3135xxx  with propranolol, but not  xxxd2689xxx  or
metoprolol, significantly altered the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd3135xxx . among volunteers who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg on the seventh day of
treatment with propranolol 120mg twice daily, the
auc and cmax of  xxxd3135xxx  were significantly (p
< 0.001) higher (67 and 75%), than in those who
received placebo and  xxxd3135xxx . the tmax was not
significantly affected. the elimination rate constant for  xxxd3135xxx  was significantly lower during
concomitant administration with propranolol than
during administration with placebo (0.25 vs 0.33
h–1, p = 0.025); this was due to a prolongation of
the t1⁄2 from 2.2 to 2.8 hours. a reduction of the
dosage of propranolol to 60mg twice daily and/or
the incorporation of a delay of 1 or 2 hours between
propranolol and  xxxd3135xxx  administration did not
significantly change the effect of propranolol on
 xxxd3135xxx  pharmacokinetics.[43] patients should
be prescribed  xxxd3135xxx  5mg if they are also receiving propranolol (section 6).
 xxxd3135xxx  had no effect on the auc or cmax
of  xxxd2054xxx  or  xxxd2751xxx  ( xxxd2751xxx ) in a randomised, double-blind, crossover
study in 18 healthy women taking oral contraceptives.[42] the women received once-daily  xxxd3135xxx  10mg for 6 days, followed by 2 days of

 xxxd3135xxx  10mg every 4 hours for three doses or
matching placebo along with their daily single
dose of oral contraceptive ( xxxd2751xxx  1mg
plus  xxxd2054xxx  35mug).
paroxetine caused a slight but statistically significant increase in the t1⁄2 of  xxxd3135xxx  in a
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers; no other
pharmacokinetic parameters (cmax, auc, tmax,
clr, ue) were affected.[46] the volunteers were
administered  xxxd3135xxx  10mg after 14 days of receiving paroxetine 20 mg/day or placebo. the t1⁄2
of  xxxd3135xxx  in the placebo and paroxetine groups
was 1.78 and 2.09 hours (p ≤ 0.05). this difference
was deemed clinically insignificant. the pharmacokinetics of n-monodesmethylrizatriptan were
unaffected by paroxetine.
4. therapeutic efficacy
this section provides an update on the use of
 xxxd3135xxx  in the treatment of migraine with or
without aura in adults, and discusses the use of
 xxxd3135xxx  in the treatment of menstrual migraine
(i.e. migraine that is exacerbated around the time
of menses) and migraine in adolescents.
since the earlier review, there have been two
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
parallel group, multicentre, outpatient studies
comparing oral  xxxd3135xxx  with oral  xxxd3562xxx 
or naratriptan.[50,51] there has also been a 6-month
nonblind study further evaluating the long-term efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg or standard care,[52]
as well as a large noncomparative trial evaluating
the use of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg in a clinical setting in
33 147 patients.[53]
patients included in the trials were aged ≥18
years, met ihs criteria for migraine with or without aura, had at least a 6-month history of migraine
and typically experienced between one and eight
attacks per month.[50-53] patients were excluded
from the placebo-controlled studies if they had
clinically proven cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease including significant ecg abnormality
or if they had a history within the previous year, or
current evidence of, drug or alcohol abuse.[50-52] in
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

the comparative trial with naratriptan, patients
were excluded if they had previously taken
 xxxd3135xxx  or naratriptan.[51] in the other doubleblind trial, previous use of  xxxd3135xxx  or  xxxd3562xxx  was not an exclusion criterion.[50] in both
double-blind studies,[50,51] patients were permitted
to take medications for migraine prophylaxis provided they did not use a mao inhibitor or  xxxd2621xxx  within the previous two weeks, propranolol
within the previous 3 days, any  xxxd3263xxx , ergot derivative or opioid within the previous 24 hours or
any other analgesic or antiemetic within the previous 6 hours. in the long-term study, migraine
prophylaxis was also allowed, although propranolol was not permitted within 1 hour of an attack in
patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg; ergot derivatives, sumatriptan or  xxxd2395xxx  were not
permitted within 24 hours of an attack in recipients
of either dose of  xxxd3135xxx , and mao inhibitors
and  xxxd2621xxx  were prohibited throughout the
duration of the study.[52]
patients were excluded from the large noncomparative study if they had severe hepatic or
renal insufficiency, a history of cerebrovascular
events or transient ischaemic attacks, moderate or
severe hypertension or untreated mild hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, prinzmetal’s variant
angina, peripheral vascular disease or basilar or
hemiplegic migraine; patients at high risk for undiagnosed heart disease were also excluded.[53]
severity of headache pain was measured on a
4-point scale,[50-53] and pain relief was defined as
a reduction in the severity of headache from moderate or severe (grade 2 or 3) to mild or no pain
(grade 1 or 0).[50-52] the definition of pain relief
was not reported in the large noncomparative
trial.[53] primary efficacy analysis in the comparative trial with  xxxd3562xxx  was based on the time
taken (0.5, 1, 1.5 or 2 hours) for the complete abolition of headache pain (i.e. pain free).[50] in the
comparative trial with naratriptan,[51] the primary
efficacy endpoint was the time taken (0.5, 1, 1.5 or
2 hours) for pain relief. other efficacy assessments
in the two double-blind studies included the number of patients who were pain free or had pain relief

at timepoints up to 2 hours,[50,51] an overall effect
of treatment over a 24-hour period in the proportion of patients who reported  xxxd234xxx ,[51] as
well as the effects of treatment on functional disability graded on a 4-point scale (0 = normal function and 3 = functional incapability/requires bedrest) and on migraine-associated symptoms such as
nausea, vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia.[50,51] patients in both studies completed a 24hour migraine-specific quality-of life (qol)
questionnaire 24 hours after taking study medication.[50,51] in the long-term study,[52] efficacy analysis was based on the proportion of patients who
reported pain relief or were pain free at 2 hours,
and the number of  xxxd3135xxx  recipients who experienced 24-hour sustained pain relief or were pain
free for 24 hours after the dose (i.e. no recurrence
of headache and no use of rescue medication). the
primary efficacy assessment in the noncomparative study was the time taken (<30 minutes, between 30 minutes and 1 hour, between 1 and 2
hours or >2 hours) for  xxxd3135xxx  to take effect.
other assessments included the time to a pain-free
state.[53]
in the comparative studies,[50-52] rescue medication in the form of analgesics (i.e. nsaids or opioids) or antiemetics were allowed in patients
whose headaches failed to improve to grade 0 or 1
(absent or mild) 2 hours postdose or for recurrent
headache (a return to grade 2 or 3) within 24 hours
of the initial dose of study medication.
in the double-blind studies,[50,51] patients were
randomised to receive single-dose  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg, active comparator (at the manufacturers’
recommended dose [54,55]) or placebo in the ratio
2 : 2 : 1 to treat a single migraine headache that
was not resolving spontaneously and was of moderate or severe intensity. in the comparative trial
with  xxxd3562xxx ,[50] of the 882 patients randomised to receive  xxxd3135xxx  10mg,  xxxd3562xxx 
2.5mg or placebo, 727 patients (292, 289 and 146
 xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  and placebo recipients, respectively) were used in the efficacy assessment
(exclusion of patients from efficacy analysis was
mainly because of a lack of migraine attack during
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

the 9-month study period). of the 766 patients who
received study medication, <1% had previously
used  xxxd3135xxx  and 8% had previously taken
 xxxd3562xxx . in the comparative trial with naratriptan,[51] of the 618 patients randomised to receive  xxxd3135xxx  10mg, naratriptan 2.5mg or placebo, 521 patients (201, 213 and 107  xxxd3135xxx ,
naratriptan and placebo recipients, respectively)
were evaluable for efficacy.
in the long-term study,[52] 494 patients were
randomised in a 2 : 2 : 1 ratio to receive  xxxd3135xxx 
5mg (n = 201),  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (n = 195) or standard care (n = 98) to treat multiple migraine attacks
over a 6-month period.  xxxd3135xxx  was administered as wafers, and standard care (i.e. usual migraine treatment) included nsaids, opioids, analgesics and other triptans. patients who received
 xxxd3135xxx  were blinded to the dose. 458 patients
who treated at least one migraine attack and provided headache data were included in the efficacy
analysis (191, 181 and 86 recipients of  xxxd3135xxx 
5 or 10mg or usual therapy, respectively).
in the noncomparative study,[53] 33 147 patients
were enrolled in order to treat three moderate or
severe migraine attacks with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg.
25 501 patient diaries, which included data from
70 537 attacks, were available for efficacy analysis.
in addition to clinical trials, the use of oral
 xxxd3135xxx  in adults with migraine has been evaluated in meta-analyses and in retrospective analyses.[56-59] patient preference for  xxxd3135xxx  10mg
(wafer) or oral sumatriptan 50mg has been evaluated in two randomised, nonblind, crossover studies,[60,61] and data from five double-blind studies
involving comparisons of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg with
sumatriptan 50 or 100mg,  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg or
naratriptan 2.5mg have been retrospectively analysed for patient preference of medication.[62]
 xxxd3135xxx  has also been evaluated in adolescents with migraine (a randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study[63]) and in women with menstrual migraine (two retrospective analyses[64,65]).

4.1 acute migraine in adults
4.1.1 effects on headache

as discussed previously in drugs,[17] studies in
patients with migraine found  xxxd3135xxx  [standard
tablets and orally disintegrating tablets (wafers)]
to be more effective than placebo at providing pain
relief and a pain-free state, relieving associated
symptoms of migraine, normalising functional
ability and improving patient quality of life.[66-71]
indeed, two recently published meta-analyses (one
of which is a cochrane review,[72] in which results
from seven double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg were analysed) have
further supported these findings (see table iv for
results from the cochrane review).[72,73]
earlier comparative studies with sumatriptan,[68,70,74] as discussed in the previous review in
drugs,[17] demonstrated that at 2 hours postdose,
 xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg were significantly (p <
0.05) more effective than oral sumatriptan 25 and
100mg, respectively, at producing a pain free
state,[68,70] and that  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was significantly (p < 0.05) more effective than sumatriptan
25mg at providing pain relief (table v).[68]
 xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg also provided faster freedom
from pain than sumatriptan 25 to 100mg (table
v).[68,70] moreover, one study showed that
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg is more effective than  xxxd3135xxx 
5 mg at providing freedom from pain at 2 hours
(table v).[70] however,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was as effective as sumatriptan 50 or 100mg at producing
pain relief at 2 hours (table v).[68,70]
in more recent studies, significantly more patients given  xxxd3135xxx  10mg were pain free at 2
hours compared with  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg (p <
0.05), naratriptan 2.5mg (p < 0.001) or placebo (p
< 0.001) in two randomised, double-blind trials
(table vi).[50,51] furthermore, significantly (p <
0.05) more patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  were
pain free at 1 hour compared with naratriptan or
placebo recipients (table vi). in comparison,
 xxxd3562xxx  was significantly more effective than
placebo at abolishing pain at 1.5 (p < 0.001) and 2
hours (p < 0.001) and naratriptan was significantly
more effective than placebo at abolishing pain at 2

hours (p < 0.05) [table vi]. the odds ratio (or) for
time to no pain after  xxxd3135xxx  was significant
compared with naratriptan (2.68, p < 0.001),[51] but
not significant compared with  xxxd3562xxx  (1.26,
p = 0.075).[50]
significantly (p < 0.001) more patients treated
with  xxxd3135xxx  reported  xxxd234xxx  at 2 hours
compared with naratriptan or placebo recipients
(table vi).[50,51] indeed, the percentage of patients
who reported  xxxd234xxx  after taking  xxxd3135xxx  was also significantly greater than that in
the naratriptan group at 1 hour (p < 0.05) and at 1.5
hours (p < 0.001, table vi).[51] however, although
 xxxd3135xxx  afforded significantly greater relief
from headache at 1 hour compared with
 xxxd3562xxx  (p < 0.05), the difference between active comparators was not significant at 1.5 or 2
hours (table vi).[50] the or for time to headache
relief within 2 hours was significant for  xxxd3135xxx 
compared with naratriptan (1.62, p < 0.001), but
not significant compared with  xxxd3562xxx  (1.22,
p = 0.053).[50,51]
the proportion of patients who required rescue
medication (analgesics or antiemetics) between 2
and 4 hours after the initial dose was lower in the
 xxxd3135xxx  groups than in the  xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan groups. in one study,[50] 18.5% of the

 xxxd3135xxx  and naratriptan groups took additional
medication (p < 0.001).
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was effective in treating up to
three migraine attacks in 25 501 evaluable patients, in a noncomparative trial aimed to reflect
usual clinical practice.[53] of the 25 501 patients,
82.9, 10.8 and 6.3% of patients treated three, two
and one attack, respectively. the proportion of patients who reported feeling the first effects of
 xxxd3135xxx  within 30 minutes during the first attack
was 32.3%, which increased to 43.9% during the
third attack. the proportion of patients who felt the
first effects of  xxxd3135xxx  between 30 minutes and
1 hour during the first attack was 43.1%, which
decreased to 38.5% during the third. similarly, the
proportion of patients who felt the first effects of
 xxxd3135xxx  between 1 and 2 hours (18.2%) and >2
hours (5.5%) after the dose during the first attack
decreased during the third attack (12.6 and 3.9%).
approximately 50% of patients reported being
pain free between 1 and 2 hours after taking
 xxxd3135xxx ,[53] a response which was reported to be

and 18.2% did not become pain free until >2 hours
postdose during the first and third attacks. of the
33 147 patients enrolled, 30 452 (91.9%) continued treatment throughout the study. reasons for
continuing treatment included satisfaction with
treatment (87.4%), the rapid onset of action of
 xxxd3135xxx  (75.2%), the fact that daily activities
were possible (61.3%) and that  xxxd3135xxx  was well
tolerated (69.6%, see section 5).
4.1.2 effects on other migraine symptoms

in the earlier comparative studies with
sumatriptan,[68,70,74] 32 to 48% of patients receiving  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg were functioning normally 2 hours postdose, compared with 33 to 43%
of sumatriptan 25 to 100mg recipients (table vi).
significantly more patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg had normal functional ability at 2
hours than those who received sumatriptan 100mg
(42 vs 33%, p < 0.05) or  xxxd3135xxx  5mg (42 vs
32%, p < 0.01).[70] the effects of  xxxd3135xxx  5 or
10mg at 2 hours on most migraine associated
symptoms, except nausea, were similar to the respective comparative doses of sumatriptan.[68,70]
furthermore, the incidence of nausea at 2 hours
was significantly (p < 0.05) lower after  xxxd3135xxx 
5 and 10mg than after sumatriptan 100mg (23 and
25% vs 33%) in one trial.[70] in another trial,[68] a
significant difference in the incidence of nausea at
2 hours was observed when  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was
compared with sumatriptan 25mg (22 vs 29%, p <
0.05), but not when  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was compared with sumatriptan 50mg (22 vs 24%).
in more recent studies, the proportion of patients who were functioning normally 2 hours after
taking  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was significantly greater
compared with patients who took  xxxd3562xxx 
(p < 0.05), naratriptan (p < 0.001) or placebo (p <
0.001) in the two double-blind trials (table vi).[50,51]
 xxxd3135xxx  was significantly better than placebo or
 xxxd3562xxx  from 1 and 1.5 hours onwards, respectively, in one trial (statistical analysis was not reported),[50] whereas in the other trial,[51]  xxxd3135xxx 
was significantly better than placebo or naratriptan
at 1.5 (p < 0.001) and 2 hours (p < 0.001), respectively. conversely, the proportion of patients with

normal functional ability 2 hours after taking naratriptan (22.6%) or placebo (14.0%) was not significantly different (table vi).[51]  xxxd3562xxx ,
however, was more effective than placebo from
1.5 hours onwards.[50]
in both trials, the proportion of patients who
were free of nausea, photophobia and phonophobia
2 hours after a single migraine attack was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in the groups that took
 xxxd3135xxx  than in the placebo groups (figure 2).
compared with  xxxd3562xxx ,[50]  xxxd3135xxx  was associated with a significantly (p < 0.05) lower incidence of nausea or photophobia at 2 hours (figure
2); both active treatments were more effective than
placebo at relieving nausea, photophobia and phonophobia from 1 hour onwards. compared with
naratriptan,[51]  xxxd3135xxx  was associated with a
significantly (p < 0.05) lower incidence of photophobia or phonophobia at 2 hours.  xxxd3135xxx  provided quicker relief from nausea, photophobia and
phonophobia compared with naratriptan, with ors
of 1.53 (p = 0.009), 1.57 (p = 0.007) and 1.61 (p =
0.006), respectively, within 2 hours.
there have been two retrospective studies that
analysed data from five randomised, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trials (four of which have been
published[50,51,68,70]) that compared oral  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg tablet with oral sumatriptan 100, 50 or
25mg, naratriptan 2.5mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg in
patients with moderate or severe migraine.[59,75]
another analysis, reported as an abstract,[58] used
data from five trials that compared oral  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg with oral sumatriptan 100, 50 or 25mg, naratriptan 2.5mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg in patients
with migraine. the studies examined how effective  xxxd3135xxx  was at relieving nausea[59] or functional disability[58] within 2 hours of treatment, or
how effective it was at producing a composite of
freedom from pain, associated symptoms and
functional disability 2 hours after treatment.[75]
 xxxd3135xxx  was more effective than oral
sumatriptan 100, 50 or 25mg or naratriptan 2.5mg,
but not  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg, at eliminating nausea
within 2 hours of a migraine attack in patients with
nausea at baseline, in one analysis.[59] approxi-

fig. 2. comparative efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx , naratriptan or placebo on migraine-associated symptoms 2 hours
after taking study medication; results from two randomised,
double-blind, multicentre trials in patients with migraine with or
without aura.[50,51] in both studies, patients treated a single migraine attack that was not resolving spontaneously and was of
moderate or severe intensity. in the first study (a),[50] 727 patients received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (n = 292),  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg
(n = 289) or placebo (n = 146). in the second study (b),[51] 521
patients received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (n = 201), naratriptan 2.5mg
(n = 213) or placebo (n = 107). in both trials, there were no
significant between-group differences in baseline rates for any
of the migraine-associated symptoms. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001
vs placebo; † p < 0.05 vs active comparator.

mately 60% of patients in each treatment group
had nausea at baseline. among these patients,
 xxxd3135xxx  was more likely to be associated with
the elimination of nausea at 2 hours than oral
sumatriptan 25 (or 1.4, p = 0.017), 50 (or 1.5, p
= 0.010) or 100mg (or 1.4, p = 0.043) and naratriptan (or 1.8, p = 0.014). there was no significant difference between  xxxd3135xxx  and
 xxxd3562xxx  (or 1.3, p = 0.210). when averaged
odds ratios (aors) over the 2-hour post-treatment
period (using the timepoints 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2
hours) were analysed,  xxxd3135xxx  was more likely
than sumatriptan 50 (aor 1.6, p = 0.001) or
100mg (aor 1.6, p = 0.004) and naratriptan (aor

2 hours after treatment. there was no significant
difference between  xxxd3135xxx  and oral sumatriptan 25mg (aor 1.2, p = 0.99) or  xxxd3562xxx 
(aor 1.0, p = 0.78).[59]
with respect to functional disability,[58] more
patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg were functioning normally 2 hours after treatment than patients who received oral sumatriptan 25, 50 or
100mg, naratriptan 2.5mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg.
the analysis involved data concerning 3601 patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg or an active
comparator; approximately 97% of patients in each
treatment group had functional disability at baseline. among these patients,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg provided a significantly higher incidence of normal
function than sumatriptan 100 (39 vs 32%, p =
0.027), 50 (47 vs 43%, p = 0.032) or 25mg (48 vs
36%, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5mg (36 vs 22%, p
= 0.006) or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg (48 vs 37%, p =
0.025).[58]
results from the other analysis demonstrated
that significantly more patients who received
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg were free from pain, nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, vomiting and functional
disability (i.e. were symptom free) 2 hours postdose than patients who received sumatriptan 100
(31 vs 22%, p = 0.002), 50 (33 vs 28%, p = 0.003)
or 25mg (33 vs 24%, p < 0.001), naratriptan 2.5mg
(30 vs 11%, p < 0.001) or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg (31
vs 24%, p = 0.042).[75] compared with placebo response rates (6 to 9%), all active treatments, except
for naratriptan, had significantly (p < 0.05) higher
response rates.

wellington & plosker

proportion of patients in each active treatment
group who required additional medication (analgesics or antiemetics) for a headache that did not improve within 2 hours of the dose of study medication, or recurred within 24 hours of the dose, did
not reach statistical significance (table vi). however, each active treatment group was associated
with a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in the use
of rescue medication compared with the placebo
groups.
because the incidence of headache recurrence
is dependent on initial  xxxd234xxx  at 2 hours,
and can be confounded by the use of additional
rescue medication, there have been recent suggestions that measures of headache recurrence should
include sustained pain-free response; i.e. the proportion of patients who were pain free at 2 hours,
who do not have a recurrence of moderate or severe
headache and who do not use rescue medication in
the 2 to 24 hours postdose.[56,76,77] such an analysis
was performed retrospectively[75] on data from five
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (four of which have been published[50,51,68,70] )
that compared oral  xxxd3135xxx  10mg tablet with
oral sumatriptan 100, 50 or 25mg, naratriptan
2.5mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg. significantly more
 xxxd3135xxx  recipients had a 24-hour sustained painfree response than patients who received sumatriptan 50 (30 vs 26%, p = 0.015) or 25mg (27 vs
20%, p = 0.005), naratriptan (29 vs 17%, p = 0.004)
or  xxxd3562xxx  (32 vs 24%, p = 0.013). although
24-hour sustained pain-free rates were higher in
 xxxd3135xxx  recipients than in sumatriptan 100mg
recipients (27 vs 23%), the difference did not
achieve statistical significance (p = 0.112).[75]

4.1.3 treatment of migraine recurrence

the incidence of headache recurrence within 24
hours of the initial dose was similar among patients
treated with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg or  xxxd3562xxx 
2.5mg (28 vs 29%);[50] however, naratriptan 2.5mg
was associated with a lower incidence of headache
recurrence than  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (21 vs 33%, statistical analysis not reported; table vi).[51] in the
two double-blind studies,[50,51] the mean time to
recurrence was about 12 hours after  xxxd3135xxx ,
 xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan. the difference in the

4.1.4 quality-of-life assessment

as discussed in the previous review,[17]  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg and sumatriptan 25 and 50mg
showed similar efficacy with respect to quality-oflife assessment using the validated 24-hour migraine-specific qol questionnaire, except that
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was significantly (p < 0.05) better
than sumatriptan 50mg in the work domain.[68]

4.1.5 long-term efficacy

as discussed in the previous review in drugs,[17]
in a long-term (≤1 year) study in 1746 patients who
treated 46 773 migraine attacks,[78] the median
number of attacks during which patients reported
pain relief or an absence of pain was significantly
(p < 0.05) greater with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (90 and
50%) than with  xxxd3135xxx  5mg (80 and 35%) or
usual therapy [70 and 29% (76% of patients in the
usual therapy group used an unspecified dose of
sumatriptan either alone or in combination with
other agents to treat 84% of attacks)].
similar results were obtained in a more recent
study of similar design.[52] 458 evaluable patients
received  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg (both of which were
administered as the wafer formulation) or usual
 xxxd2022xxx  treatment for multiple attacks over a
6-month period. the median number of treated attacks in the  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg and usual therapy
groups was 13, 16 and 14. the most frequently used
drug in the usual therapy group was sumatriptan
(dose not specified), which was used by 85% of
patients to treat 77% of attacks. other frequently
used medications in the usual therapy group were
opioids (21% of patients), nsaids (19%), paracetamol (acetaminophen) [12%] and barbiturates
(12%). a total of 8229 attacks were treated during
the 6-month period.[52]
the median percentage of attacks in which
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg recipients reported pain relief or
an absence of pain 2 hours after the dose was 82
and 46% (figure 3).[52] corresponding values
among recipients of  xxxd3135xxx  5mg (72 and 25%)
or usual therapy (73 and 30%) were lower (figure
3). treatment response was not affected by the duration of treatment. ors suggested that  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg was significantly better at producing pain
relief or an absence of pain at 2 hours than

 xxxd3135xxx  5mg (1.60 and 1.93, p < 0.001 for both
comparisons) or usual therapy (1.63 and 1.50, p <
0.001 and 0.05).  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was also better
at providing 24-hour sustained pain relief or 24hour sustained absence of pain than  xxxd3135xxx 
5mg; a comparison with usual care was not undertaken. the median percentage of attacks with sustained 24-hour pain relief or absence of pain
among  xxxd3135xxx  10mg recipients was 48 and
31%, respectively. corresponding values among
patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  5mg were 37 and
17%.
discontinuations due to inefficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  were low; 5.8 and 5.5% of  xxxd3135xxx  5 or
10mg recipients discontinued treatment prematurely because of lack of efficacy.[52]
4.1.6 meta-analyses

there have been two large, recently published
meta-analyses comparing the efficacy and tolerability (see section 5) of sumatriptan 100mg with
that of other triptans, including  xxxd3135xxx .[56,57]
both studies showed  xxxd3135xxx  10mg to be one of
the most effective  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists for
the treatment of migraine in adults.

in one of the studies, 53 randomised, doubleblind, controlled trials involving 24 089 adult patients with moderate or severe migraine with or without aura who were treated with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or
10mg, sumatriptan 25, 50 or 100mg,  xxxd3562xxx  2.5
or 5mg, naratriptan 2.5mg, almotriptan 12.5mg, or
 xxxd1976xxx  20, 40 or 80mg were included in the analysis.[56] a single ihs-defined migraine attack, the
severity of which was measured using the 4-point
scale, had to have been treated within 8 hours of
onset. in studies that treated up to three attacks,
data for the first attack were used for response
rates. data from all three attacks were used for
analysis of consistent response. response rates for
all efficacy and tolerability (section 5) parameters
were compared with oral sumatriptan 100mg. efficacy parameters included the proportion of patients who had pain relief at 2 hours (after treatment), were pain free at 2 hours, experienced a
sustained absence of pain for 24 hours after the
initial dose (and did not use additional medication), and patients who had a recurrence of headache 2 to 24 hours after the dose. data presented in
the discussion of this analysis have been estimated
from graphs.
compared with sumatriptan 100mg (59%, 95%
ci 57 to 60%),  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (69.5%, 95% ci
67 to 71%),  xxxd1976xxx  80mg (66.5%, 95% ci 63 to
69%) and  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg (64%, 95% ci 61 to
66.5%) were better at providing  xxxd234xxx 
within 2 hours.  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (40%, 95% ci 38
to 42%), almotriptan 12.5mg (36%, 95% ci 32 to
39%) and  xxxd1976xxx  80mg (33%, 95% ci 30.5 to
35%) afforded higher 2-hour pain-free rates than
sumatriptan 100mg (29%, 95% ci 27 to 30%), and
24-hour sustained pain-free rates were also higher
for  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (25.5%, 95% ci 23.5 to 27%),
almotriptan 12.5mg (26%, 95% ci 23 to 29%) and
 xxxd1976xxx  80mg (25%, 95% ci 23 to 27%), when
compared with sumatriptan 100mg (20%, 95% ci
18 to 21%). however, headache recurrence rates
were higher with  xxxd3135xxx  5 (37.5%, 95% ci 35
to 40%) or 10mg (40%, 95% ci 37 to 43%) than
with sumatriptan 100mg (30%, 95% ci 27 to
33%).[56]

in an analysis of multiple-attack studies (it was
not reported which studies were used and data were
not available for  xxxd3135xxx  5mg, sumatriptan 25
or 50mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5 or 5mg),  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg was shown to provide the highest consistent
therapeutic response rate when compared with
sumatriptan 100mg.[56] however, all the studies
except for those of  xxxd3135xxx  had a parallel group
design;  xxxd3135xxx  was evaluated in a crossover
study. a response in at least two of three attacks
occurred in 86% (95% ci 82 to 90%) of patients
who received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg. in comparison, almotriptan 12.5mg,  xxxd1976xxx  80mg, sumatriptan
100mg and naratriptan 2.5mg afforded response
rates of 73% (95% ci 69 to 77%), 70% (65 to 75%),
67% (95% ci 64 to 70%) and 47% (95% ci 39 to
55%), respectively. furthermore, a response in all
three attacks occurred in 60% (95% ci 54 to 66%)
of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg recipients, compared with 47%
(95% ci 41 to 53%), 42% (95% ci 38 to 46%),
36% (95% ci 32 to 40%) and 16% (95% ci 9 to
23%) of patients who received almotriptan 12.5mg,
 xxxd1976xxx  80mg, sumatriptan 100mg or naratriptan
2.5mg, respectively.[56]
the other meta-analysis compared efficacy results from 28 randomised, double-blind, placebocontrolled trials of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg, oral sumatriptan 50 or 100mg,  xxxd3562xxx  2.5 or 5mg,
naratriptan 2.5mg,  xxxd1976xxx  20, 40 or 80mg or almotriptan 12.5mg.[57] the trials included in the
analysis had to have had data available for singledose treatment of a single attack (data from the first
attack only was used in studies which examined
treatment of multiple attacks) with no repeat or rescue medication used within 2 hours. headache severity was to have been measured before and after
treatment with the standard 4-point scale. the primary efficacy variable analysed was the proportion
of patients who were pain free at 2 hours. results
were presented as therapeutic gain (placebo-subtracted response) and the subsequent number of patients needed to treat (nnt) in order for one patient
to have a positive outcome. as in the previously
discussed analysis,[56] response rates were compared with those of oral sumatriptan 100mg. howdrugs 2002; 62 (10)

figure 4).[57] furthermore, significantly more patients treated with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (nnt 3.2)
were likely to be pain free at 2 hours than patients
who received sumatriptan 100 (nnt 4.7, p < 0.02)
or 50mg (nnt 5.9, p < 0.01),  xxxd1976xxx  40mg
(nnt 4.7, p < 0.01),  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg (nnt 5.0,
p < 0.05), almotriptan 12.5mg (nnt 4.65, p <
0.01), naratriptan 2.5mg (nnt 8.2, p < 0.001) or
 xxxd1976xxx  20mg (nnt 9.8, p < 0.001). nnt values
for  xxxd1976xxx  80mg and  xxxd3562xxx  5mg were 3.8
and 4.2 and were not significantly different from
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg.

4.1.7 patient preference studies

results from two randomised, nonblind, crossover studies demonstrated that more patients preferred treatment with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (wafer)
than with oral sumatriptan 50mg.[60,61] in one study
in 374 patients with ihs-defined migraine who
treated two attacks,[61] 57% of patients preferred
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg; in comparison, 43% preferred
sumatriptan (p < 0.01). in the other study,[60] of the
425 patients with ihs-defined migraine who completed the questionnaire, 57.6% preferred  xxxd3135xxx  10mg and 32.0% preferred sumatriptan (p
≤ 0.001); 10.4% of patients did not express a preference for either treatment. the main reason in
both studies for expressing a preference was a
more rapid onset of pain relief.
patient satisfaction with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (tablet) was significantly greater than with oral
sumatriptan 100 (33 vs 26%, p < 0.05) or 50mg (40
vs 35%, p < 0.05),  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg (38 vs 30%,
p < 0.05) or naratriptan 2.5mg (33 vs 19%, p <
0.01) according to a retrospective analysis[62] of
five double-blind clinical trials (four published
studies[50,51,68,70] and one unpublished study).

come of placebo-subtracted absence of pain at 2 hours
postdose; results from a meta-analysis of 28 double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. the triptans and doses included in the
analysis were  xxxd3135xxx  10mg, oral sumatriptan 50 or 100mg,
 xxxd3562xxx  2.5 or 5mg, naratriptan 2.5mg,  xxxd1976xxx  20, 40
or 80mg or almotriptan 12.5mg. data presented are placebosubtracted 2-hour pain-free response rates (therapeutic gain)
with 95% confidence intervals (studies were weighted for patient
numbers and magnitude of treatment effect).  xxxd3135xxx  10mg
was the only  xxxd3263xxx  associated with a significantly higher therapeutic gain than oral sumatriptan 100mg, against which all the
triptans were compared.[57]

 xxxd3135xxx  10mg wafer,[79] there was no significant
difference in patient preference; 179 patients preferred the tablet and 188 patients preferred the
wafer. the main reason for preference involved the
type of administration (convenience of taking the
wafer without water or preference for a pill).
4.2 menstrual migraine

two retrospective analyses have demonstrated
that  xxxd3135xxx  is effective in the treatment of menstrual migraine (i.e. migraine that is exacerbated
around the time of menses).[64,65]  xxxd3135xxx  5 and
10mg were significantly (p < 0.05) more effective
than placebo at relieving a single menstrually asdrugs 2002; 62 (10)

1562

sociated migraine attack according to a retrospective subgroup analysis of two double-blind studies,
one of which is yet to be published.[64] furthermore, a retrospective analysis, presented as an abstract,[65] of a long-term extension study showed
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg to be as effective in the treatment
of multiple menstrually associated migraine attacks as it was in the treatment of multiple nonmenstrual attacks.
in one analysis,[64] a subgroup of 335 women
(the two studies enrolled a total of 2715 men and
women) received  xxxd3135xxx  5 (n = 115) or 10mg
(n = 139) or placebo (n = 81) for the treatment of
a single migraine attack that occurred 3 days before
or after the onset of menstruation.  xxxd3135xxx  5 and
10mg were significantly (p < 0.05) more effective
than placebo in providing  xxxd234xxx  at 2
hours (70 and 68% for  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg, respectively, vs 44% for placebo) and an absence of
pain at 2 hours (42 and 33% vs 12%). furthermore,
the effects of  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg on migraineassociated functional disability, photophobia or
phonophobia were also significantly (p < 0.05)
greater than those of placebo. when the effects of
 xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg on menstrual migraine were
compared with those on nonmenstrual migraine (n
= 391 or 393), no significant differences in response rates were observed, which suggests that
 xxxd3135xxx  is as effective in the treatment of menstrual migraine as it is in the treatment of nonmenstrual migraine. the power of the study to detect a 6% difference between the menstrual and
nonmenstrual groups with respect to the percentage of patients with pain relief at 2 hours was
80%.[64]
in the other analysis,[65] 95 women who completed the double-blind phase of a controlled study
(details were not reported) treated 1839 attacks
with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg wafer over a 6-month period.
migraine attacks were defined as menstrually associated if they occurred within 3 days (±3 days)
of onset of menstruation (a prospective definition)
or within 1 day before and 2 days after (–1 or +2
days) onset of menstruation (a retrospective definition). thirty-one percent of attacks occurred

within ±3 days and 21% occurred within –1 or +2
days of menstruation.  xxxd234xxx  at 2 hours
was reported by 78% of patients who treated a migraine within 3 days of menstruation, compared
with 78% of patients who treated nonmenstrual migraines. corresponding values for absence of pain
at 2 hours were 50 and 51%. similar values were
obtained when using the other definition of menstrual migraine (an attack within –1 or +2 days of
menstruation).  xxxd234xxx  or absence of pain
at 2 hours occurred in 77 and 49% of patients with
menstrual migraine, and in 78 and 51% of patients
who treated a nonmenstrual attack.[65]
4.3 migraine in adolescents

in a randomised, double-blind, parallel group
study in adolescent patients with migraine who received  xxxd3135xxx  5mg or placebo, a high placebo
response resulted in nonsignificant between-group
differences in response rates for pain relief or freedom from pain.[63] 296 patients aged 12 to 17 years
treated a single migraine attack with one dose of
 xxxd3135xxx  5mg (n = 149) or placebo (n = 147),
followed by up to two additional doses for headache recurrence. most patients took only one dose
of study medication (89 and 86% of  xxxd3135xxx  and
placebo recipients). although the response rates
were similar to those seen in studies in adult patients, there was no significant between-group difference in response rates for  xxxd234xxx  at 2
hours (66 vs 56%) or absence of pain at 2 hours (32
vs 28%) among patients who received  xxxd3135xxx 
5mg or placebo. however, compared with placebo
recipients, significantly more  xxxd3135xxx -treated
patients had no functional disability at 2 hours (44
vs 36%, p < 0.05) and had pain relief at 3 hours (75
vs 63%, p < 0.05).
5. tolerability
the previous review in drugs[17] showed that
 xxxd3135xxx  is well tolerated and that the most common adverse events, usually cns- or gastrointestinal-related, were mild and transient. furthermore, it
was shown that the incidence of drug-related adverse
events in patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  5 or
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

10mg or oral sumatriptan 25 or 50mg were similar,
but significantly lower with both doses of
 xxxd3135xxx  than with sumatriptan 100mg (p <
0.01). the reader is referred to the previous review
for discussion of these studies. since the earlier
review, available data concerning the tolerability
of  xxxd3135xxx  have increased, and are discussed
herein.
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was well tolerated in the two
recent double-blind trials with  xxxd3562xxx  and
naratriptan.[50,51] the most common adverse
events associated with  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  or
naratriptan were cns- or gastrointestinal-related,
and included asthenia/fatigue, dizziness, somnolence and nausea (figure 5). these adverse event
were, however, reported by relatively small percentages of patients (≤8%). the incidence of chest
pain (a feeling of tightness or pressure in the chest)
was similar after the administration of the three
active drugs (2 to 4%; figure 5). in one study,[50]
although the incidence of adverse events (whether
related to treatment or not) in patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  was lower than in those who received  xxxd3562xxx  (31.2 vs 38.8%), the difference
did not quite reach statistical significance (p =
0.051); 22.1% of patients in the placebo group experienced ≥ 1 adverse event (p < 0.05 vs  xxxd3135xxx 
or  xxxd3562xxx ). in the other study,[51]  xxxd3135xxx 
was associated with a significantly (p < 0.05)
higher incidence of adverse events compared with
naratriptan or placebo; 39, 29 and 23% of  xxxd3135xxx , naratriptan or placebo recipients, respectively, reported ≥1 adverse event.
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg was well tolerated in the large
noncomparative study in 33 147 patients who
treated up to three moderate or severe migraine
attacks.[53] 304 patients (0.9%) reported at least
one adverse event. the most frequent were dizziness, asthenia/fatigue and nausea which occurred
in 0.21, 0.17 and 0.11% of patients, respectively.
chest pain, which has been reported in up to 3%
of patients taking  xxxd3135xxx  10mg in controlled
clinical trials, was reported by only 0.05% of patients in this study. 157 patients (0.47%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. one

fig. 5. tolerability of  xxxd3135xxx ,  xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan;
results from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicentre trials.[50,51] except for chest pain, adverse events
presented occurred in ≥5% of patients who received at least
one dose of  xxxd3135xxx . in both studies, patients treated a single
migraine attack that was not resolving spontaneously and was
of moderate or severe intensity. in the first study (a),[50] 766
patients received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (n = 308),  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg
(n = 304) or placebo (n = 154). in the second study (b),[51] 522
patients received  xxxd3135xxx  10mg (n = 201), naratriptan 2.5mg
(n = 214) or placebo (n = 107). in both trials, statistical analysis
was not reported for specific adverse events.

imipramine (concomitant administration of
 xxxd3135xxx  and ergotamine or its derivatives was
not allowed in this study).
the two meta-analyses discussed in section
4.1.6 had similarities as well as differences in their
conclusions regarding relative tolerabilities of the
studied triptans.[56,57] the larger of the two analyses showed that sumatriptan 100mg (13%, 95% ci
8 to 18%) was associated with a similar incidence
of placebo-subtracted adverse events as  xxxd3135xxx 
5 (8%, 95% ci 4 to 11%) or 10mg (14%, 95% ci
10 to 16%), sumatriptan 25 (5%, 95% ci 0 to 9%)
or 50mg (8%, 95% ci 2 to 13.5%),  xxxd3562xxx  2.5
(16%, 95% ci 10 to 23%) or 5mg (25%, 95% ci
15 to 34) or  xxxd1976xxx  20 (2%, 95% ci –16 to 20%),
40 (7%, 95% ci 2 to 12%) or 80mg (20%, 95% ci
11 to 27%).[56] almotriptan 12.5mg (2%, 95% ci
–3 to 6%) and naratriptan 2.5mg (2%, 95% ci –2
to 7%) were both associated with significantly
fewer adverse events than sumatriptan 100mg.
however, the investigators warned that total adverse event rates should be interpreted with caution
because they reflect proportions of patients with at
least one adverse event, irrespective of their number, nature or intensity. when placebo-subtracted
adverse events were segregated into cns- or
chest-related events, the only tested drug to have a
more favourable tolerability profile than sumatriptan 100mg [6% (95% ci 3 to 9%) and 1.9%
(95% ci 1 to 2.7%)] was almotriptan 12.5mg
[–1.6% (95% ci –4.6 to 1%) and –0.3% (95% ci
–1.7 to 0.6%)]. the incidence of chest-related adverse events with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg was 0.8%
(95% ci –0.1 to 1.7%) and 1.5% (95% ci 1 to
2%);[56] sumatriptan 25, 50 or 100mg,  xxxd3562xxx 
2.5 or 5mg, naratriptan 2.5mg and  xxxd1976xxx  20, 40
or 80mg were associated with a similar incidence.
the other analysis concluded that  xxxd3562xxx 
5mg and  xxxd1976xxx  80mg were the least tolerated
triptans included in the study after correcting for
placebo event rates.[57] the number of patients
needed to treat in order for one patient to experience an adverse event [number needed to harm
( xxxd669xxx )] with  xxxd3562xxx  5mg and  xxxd1976xxx 
80mg was 3.4 and 4.6. when the  xxxd669xxx  for

for the other triptans,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg ( xxxd669xxx  6.8,
p < 0.01),  xxxd1976xxx  40mg ( xxxd669xxx  10.7, p < 0.01),
 xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg ( xxxd669xxx  6.7, p < 0.01), sumatriptan 100mg ( xxxd669xxx  5.5, p < 0.01), sumatriptan
50mg ( xxxd669xxx  14.3, p < 0.001), almotriptan 12.5mg
( xxxd669xxx  45, p < 0.001) and naratriptan 2.5mg ( xxxd669xxx 
72, p < 0.001) were all significantly less likely to
be associated with adverse events than  xxxd3562xxx  5mg.
among 296 adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years)
who treated a single migraine attack with either
 xxxd3135xxx  5mg or placebo (they were allowed to
take up to two further doses for recurrence of headache), the percentage of patients in each group who
reported ≥1 adverse event (34 vs 35%) was similar
to the incidence reported in studies in adults. common adverse events were also similar to those reported in adult studies: asthenia/fatigue, dizziness,
somnolence, dry mouth and nausea.[63]
data concerning the tolerability of  xxxd3135xxx  in
patients with menstrual migraine were not reported
in the two retrospective analyses discussed in section 4.2.[64,65]
5.1 long-term tolerability

the incidence of adverse events (whether related to treatment or not) among patients who received  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg or usual therapy for
the treatment of multiple migraine attacks over a
6-month period was similar (53, 60 and 66%, respectively).[52] the incidence of adverse events
thought to be drug-related was significantly higher
after  xxxd3135xxx  10mg than after  xxxd3135xxx  5mg
(31 vs 20%, p < 0.05) but similar to that after usual
therapy (26%). figure 6 illustrates the incidence of
adverse events in the three treatment groups. the
most common adverse events associated with any
of the treatment regimens were nausea, upper respiratory tract infection, dizziness and somnolence. the incidence of pharyngeal discomfort was
significantly lower in the  xxxd3135xxx  10 (p < 0.05)
and 5mg (p < 0.01) groups than in the usual therapy
group (figure 6). furthermore, compared with
usual therapy,  xxxd3135xxx  5mg was also associated

6. dosage and administration
 xxxd3135xxx  is indicated for the treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. it is available
in 5 or 10mg doses in standard tablet form or as
orally disintegrating tablets (wafers). the information described herein has been obtained from the
us prescribing information.[27]
© adis international limited. all rights reserved.

the recommended initial dose is 5 or 10mg. selection of dose should be made on a per patient
basis, as interpatient response to each of the two
doses may vary. if required, additional doses for
headache recurrence should be separated by at
least 2 hours; no more than 30mg should be taken
during a 24-hour period. the use of  xxxd3135xxx  for
the treatment of more than four migraines in a 30day period has not been established. the use of
 xxxd3135xxx  in elderly patients has had limited clinical experience; however, dose adjustments based
solely on age are not considered necessary.
 xxxd3135xxx  should not be used for the treatment of
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

1566

hemiplegic or basilar migraine, or for migraine
prophylaxis.[27]
 xxxd3135xxx  is contraindicated in patients with
ischaemic heart disease or patients with symptoms
or findings consistent with ischaemic heart disease, coronary artery vasospasm (including prinzmetal’s variant angina), other significant underlying cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled
hypertension. if risk factors for coronary artery disease are present,  xxxd3135xxx  should be administered
after cardiovascular evaluation and in the presence
of a physician. ecg monitoring is recommended
after the first dose in patients with risk factors, and
periodically in long-term users of the drug.[27]
 xxxd3135xxx  should be administered with caution
in patients on dialysis and in patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency. although the propensity
for  xxxd3135xxx  to bind to melanin has not been evaluated, there is a theoretical possibility that longterm use of  xxxd3135xxx  may cause adverse ophthalmological effects. the orally disintegrating tablet
contains phenylalanine (1.05mg per 5mg tablet and
2.10mg per 10mg tablet) and, therefore, patients
with phenylketonuria should be informed of this.
 xxxd3135xxx  can cause somnolence or dizziness in
some patients which may impair their performance.[27]
 xxxd3135xxx  is included in pregnancy category c
(risk cannot be ruled out), and should be prescribed
to pregnant patients only if the benefit to the
mother outweighs the risk to the fetus. it is not
known if  xxxd3135xxx  is excreted in human milk;
however, it is extensively excreted in rat milk (>5fold maternal plasma concentrations). the use of
 xxxd3135xxx  in paediatric patients has not been established and, therefore, it should be used only in
patients >18 years of age. [27]
coadministration of propranolol and  xxxd3135xxx 
can lead to an increase in plasma concentrations of
 xxxd3135xxx  of up to 75% (section 3.3); therefore,
patients should be prescribed  xxxd3135xxx  5mg if
they are also receiving propranolol. concomitant
use of 5-ht1 agonists and selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (ssris) can cause weakness,
hyperreflexia and incoordination (symptoms of the

wellington & plosker

serotonin syndrome). although this effect is rarely
observed, it is recommended that the patient be
monitored for these symptoms if  xxxd3135xxx  is
coadministered with an ssri.  xxxd3135xxx  should
not be administered to patients who are currently
receiving an mao-a inhibitor or a nonspecific
mao inhibitor because of the subsequent increase
in plasma concentrations of  xxxd3135xxx  (section
3.3). the use of  xxxd3135xxx  within 2 weeks of discontinuing therapy with an mao inhibitor is contraindicated. concomitant administration of ergotamine or ergot-containing drugs with  xxxd3135xxx  or
other 5-ht1 agonists within 24 hours is contraindicated because of a theoretical possibility of additive vasospastic effects.[27]
the coadministration of  xxxd3135xxx  (10 to 30
mg/day for 6 days) with oral contraceptives did not
affect the plasma concentrations of  xxxd2054xxx  or  xxxd2751xxx  in a study in 18 healthy
women.[27,42]
7. place of  xxxd3135xxx  in the
management of migraine
migraine, a chronic and incapacitating neurological disorder, is a common disease with a 1-year
prevalence (in western populations) of 15 to 18%
in women and about 6% in men.[2,5,80] although
migraine attacks can start at any age, they primarily manifest during adolescence.[3,4] however, migraine occurs predominantly between the ages of
25 and 55 years, with a peak prevalence around age
40.[81] the median frequency of migraine attacks
is 1.5 per month, and the median duration of each
attack is 24 hours; however, ≥10% of patients have
weekly attacks and 20% have attacks that last 2 to
3 days.[4] despite the relatively high prevalence,
the majority of patients with migraine have not visited a physician for headache during the previous
year, have never been diagnosed with migraine,
and treat their attacks with over-the-counter (otc)
medicines.[4,81]
migraine attacks may be triggered by dietary
factors, such as alcohol, tyramine (found in aged
cheese and red wine), caffeine, caffeine withdrawal, phenylethylamine (found in chocolate),
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

monosodium glutamate and fasting; certain drugs
(e.g. oral contraceptives, vasodilators, cimetidine),
menses or other factors (e.g. weather, sleep, stress
or trauma) may also trigger migraine attacks.[82-84]
migraine can have a profoundly negative effect
on the lives of affected individuals, and can have
major secondary effects on the families and employers of those with the condition.[1,2,85-87] indeed, in the us it is estimated that an average of
19.55 annual work days per patient are lost because
of absenteeism or diminished productive work
hours due to migraine.[85] furthermore, migraine
may cause profound emotional changes over the
long term and result in coping strategies that interfere with daily activities.[1]
the first step in the treatment of migraine involves nonpharmacological approaches, such as
lifestyle changes and avoidance of trigger factors.[84,88-90] regular exercise and sleeping habits,
a strict meal schedule, limiting caffeine intake and
stopping smoking can help to minimise the occurrence of migraine. however, because migraine
may be triggered by multiple factors in many patients, this approach can be difficult.[4]
the pharmacological treatment of migraine
should be individualised for each patient and
should take into account the frequency and severity of the attacks, as well as associated symptoms
such as nausea and vomiting.[89,91] furthermore,
treatment can be for the management of acute attacks or for migraine prophylaxis.[4] preventative
therapy is often used in patients who have attacks
that are unresponsive to acute-attack medication
and that cause substantial functional disability.
the mostly widely used agents for migraine prophylaxis are beta-blockers (e.g. metoprolol, propranolol,  xxxd3377xxx ,  xxxd2689xxx  and atenolol), which reduce
the frequency of attacks by 50% in about 75% of
patients. other agents used include calcium antagonists (e.g. verapamil), nsaids, serotonin agonists (e.g.  xxxd2621xxx  and methylergonovine),

aspirin (acetyl  xxxd3159xxx ) and paracetamol, often in combination with an opioid (e.g. codeine) or
an antiemetic, and nsaids.[4,88] indeed, the combination of aspirin, paracetamol and caffeine has
recently been approved in the us for the treatment
of migraine and associated symptoms;[97] in three
randomised, double-blind studies in patients with
moderate to severe migraine, pooled 2-hour painrelief and pain-free response rates were significantly higher with the combination treatment (59
and 21%), than with placebo (33 and 7%, p ≤ 0.001
for both comparisons).[98] however, problems associated with the unsupervised use of otc medicines include insufficient or excessive doses, drug
interactions with other agents, and excessive frequency of use which may lead to medicationoveruse headache, adverse effects or dependency.[17,96,99,100]
ergot derivatives, such as dihydroergotamine
and  xxxd2022xxx , have been used extensively as a first-line treatment for migraine in patients with moderate or severe attacks or in those
patients whose headaches respond poorly to otc
medicines.[84,88,91] they have a high affinity for
 xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor subtypes, but also have high
affinity for other serotonin, adrenergic and dopaminergic receptor subtypes.[7] as such, they are
associated with a number of adverse events such
as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, tremors, limb paraesthesia and ergotism; they are also associated
with a high risk of rebound headaches and overuse
syndromes.[4,84,101] in a recent review of the use of
ergotamine in the acute treatment of migraine,[102]
tfelt-hansen et al. suggested that, ideally, patients
should be prescribed a selective  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonist in the first instance, thus by-passing
ergotamine as a treatment option.
the introduction of sumatriptan, the first of the
selective  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists, was considered a major advance in the treatment of migraine
because, while maintaining good efficacy, it is associated with fewer adverse events than the ergot
derivatives.[103] over the past decade, it has been
widely used as a first- or second-line therapy for
the treatment of moderate or severe attacks, and
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

has become the perceived ‘gold standard’ against
which other triptans are evaluated for efficacy and
tolerability.[56] however, sumatriptan does have
some limitations; after oral administration it has
low oral bioavailability (14%) and a relatively
short t1⁄2 (2 hours), which may contribute to the high
rate of headache recurrence (30 to 40%) seen with
this drug.[104-106] absorption of oral sumatriptan is
also relatively slow (tmax ≈ 1.5 to 2.5 hours), which
may affect the time to the onset of pain relief (table
vii).[104,106,107] however, subcutaneous injection
of sumatriptan overcomes these limitations, and
provides faster and higher response rates than oral
administration.[100,108,109] the most common adverse events associated with sumatriptan (after oral
or subcutaneous administration) include nausea/vomiting, taste disturbances, malaise/fatigue and dizziness/vertigo; reaction site adverse events are also
common after subcutaneous injection.[109,110]
chest pain is also well documented in patients administered sumatriptan, and has an incidence of
between 3 and 5%.[109] subsequent to the introduction of sumatriptan, ‘second generation’ triptans
(e.g.  xxxd3135xxx , naratriptan,  xxxd3562xxx ,  xxxd1976xxx , almotriptan and frovatriptan) have been
developed with the objective of overcoming some
of these limitations.[106]
oral  xxxd3135xxx  has proved effective in the treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. in
earlier comparative trials, as reviewed by dooley
and faulds,[17]  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg was significantly more effective than placebo at providing
pain relief and a pain-free state, normalising func-

tional ability and eliminating migraine-associated
symptoms such as nausea, phonophobia or photophobia at 2 hours postdose. earlier studies also
showed that  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg was significantly
more effective than oral sumatriptan 25 and
100mg, respectively, at producing a pain-free state
at 2 hours. furthermore, it was demonstrated that
 xxxd3135xxx  is more likely to provide pain relief
within 2 hours of administration than sumatriptan
25 to 100mg, suggesting that  xxxd3135xxx  has a faster
onset of action. with regard to migraine-associated
symptoms,  xxxd3135xxx  was significantly more effective than sumatriptan at normalising functional
disability and at relieving nausea at 2 hours.[17]
in more recent studies,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was
more effective than  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg at producing a pain-free state at 2 hours postdose, and was
more effective than naratriptan at producing a
pain-free state from 1 hour onwards (section 4.1.1).
furthermore,  xxxd3135xxx  was more effective than
naratriptan at providing pain relief from 1 hour onwards. although  xxxd3135xxx  was not more effective
than  xxxd3562xxx  at providing  xxxd234xxx  at 2
hours, more patients given  xxxd3135xxx  than  xxxd3562xxx  experienced pain relief 1 hour postdose. ors
for time to no pain and time to pain relief were in
favour of  xxxd3135xxx  compared with naratriptan, but
similar when compared with  xxxd3562xxx . fewer patients receiving  xxxd3135xxx  required rescue medication (analgesics or antiemetics) 2 to 4 hours postdose
than patients who received naratriptan or  xxxd3562xxx . headache recurrence rates were similar in recipients of  xxxd3135xxx  or  xxxd3562xxx  (28 vs 29%).

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

although it was reported that the rate of headache
recurrence with naratriptan was lower than with
 xxxd3135xxx  (21 vs 33%), a statistical analysis was
not reported in the study (section 4.1.1).
 xxxd3135xxx  was also more effective than
 xxxd3562xxx  or naratriptan at normalising functional ability and reducing the incidence of photophobia within 2 hours of the dose. furthermore,
fewer  xxxd3135xxx -treated patients were feeling nauseous at 2 hours compared with  xxxd3562xxx  recipients, and the incidence of phonophobia was lower
among recipients of  xxxd3135xxx  than in naratriptan
recipients (section 4.1.2). two retrospective analyses demonstrated that, in patients with migraineassociated symptoms at baseline,  xxxd3135xxx  is
more likely to eliminate nausea 2 hours postdose
than oral sumatriptan 25, 50 or 100mg or naratriptan 2.5mg, and more likely than sumatriptan
25, 50 or 100mg, naratriptan 2.5mg or  xxxd3562xxx 
2.5mg to normalise functional ability at 2 hours
(section 4.1.2).
in a long-term study in which patients treated
multiple migraine attacks with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or
10mg or usual therapy (typically sumatriptan), the
efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  was not reduced by longterm use. furthermore, ors for time to pain relief
or no pain were significantly in favour of  xxxd3135xxx  10mg compared with  xxxd3135xxx  5mg or usual
therapy (section 4.1.5).
in a large noncomparative study (n = 33 147)
aimed at reflecting usual clinical practice, the response to  xxxd3135xxx  (i.e. a pain-free state between
1 and 2 hours postdose) remained approximately
constant in three separate attacks (≈50%; section
4.1.1).
results from two large meta-analyses concluded that  xxxd3135xxx  is one of the most effective
 xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor agonists for the treatment of
migraine (section 4.1.6). in one of the studies, in
which 53 double-blind clinical trials involving
 xxxd3135xxx , sumatriptan,  xxxd1976xxx , almotriptan,
 xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan were analysed,
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg,  xxxd1976xxx  80mg and  xxxd3562xxx 
2.5mg were better at providing  xxxd234xxx 
within 2 hours than sumatriptan 100mg. compared

with sumatriptan 100mg,  xxxd1976xxx  80mg, almotriptan 12.5mg or naratriptan 2.5mg,  xxxd3135xxx 
was shown to provide the highest consistent therapeutic response in the treatment of up to three
migraine attacks. however, headache recurrence
rates were higher with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or 10mg than
with sumatriptan 100mg. in the other meta-analysis of 28 clinical trials,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was the
only  xxxd3263xxx  associated with a higher therapeutic
gain than oral sumatriptan 100mg, against which
all the triptans were compared.
the higher prevalence of migraine among
women is thought to be associated with the fluctuation in endogenous estrogen concentrations associated with menarche, menstruation, pregnancy
and menopause.[111-115] indeed, the frequency of
menstrual migraine (i.e. migraine that is exacerbated around the time of menses) has been reported
to be as high as 60 to 70%.[116] furthermore, the
gender disparity in migraine prevalence becomes
evident by age 13 to 15 years, which corresponds
to the us median age of menarche of 12.8
years.[117] although the use of triptans in the treatment of menstrual migraine is relatively understudied, sumatriptan,  xxxd1976xxx  and  xxxd3562xxx 
have been shown to be effective in the treatment
of migraine associated with menstruation.[117,118]
recently, two retrospective subgroup analyses
have shown that  xxxd3135xxx  is more effective than
placebo in treating a single menstrually associated
migraine attack, and is as effective in the treatment
of multiple menstrually associated migraine attacks as it is at treating nonmenstrual migraine attacks (section 4.2).
 xxxd3135xxx  is well tolerated, with the majority
of adverse events being mild and transient. the
most common adverse events associated with
 xxxd3135xxx  are cns- or gastrointestinal-related.
the incidence and type of adverse events were
similar for  xxxd3135xxx , naratriptan and  xxxd3562xxx 
in clinical trials discussed in section 5.  xxxd3135xxx ,
 xxxd3562xxx  and naratriptan were associated with
a similar incidence of chest pain (2 to 4%). in a
large noncomparative trial involving 33 147 patients who treated up to three migraine attacks with
drugs 2002; 62 (10)

1570

 xxxd3135xxx  10mg, chest pain was reported by only
0.05% of patients. furthermore, only 0.9% of patients reported at least one adverse event, the most
common of which were dizziness, asthenia/fatigue
and nausea. however, because this was a noncomparative study, these results should be interpreted with caution.
results from a meta-analysis of 53 double-blind
trials showed that the incidence of placebo-subtracted adverse events associated with  xxxd3135xxx 
5 or 10mg is similar to that with sumatriptan 25, 50
or 100mg,  xxxd3562xxx  2.5 or 5mg or  xxxd1976xxx  20,
40 or 80mg. naratriptan 2.5mg and almotriptan
12.5mg had a more favourable tolerability profile
than sumatriptan 100mg, against which all triptans
were compared. with regards to chest-related adverse events, only almotriptan 12.5mg had a lower
incidence than sumatriptan 100mg (section 5). the
incidence of placebo-subtracted chest-related adverse events was similar with  xxxd3135xxx  5 or
10mg, sumatriptan 25, 50 or 100mg,  xxxd3562xxx 
2.5 or 5mg, naratriptan 2.5mg and  xxxd1976xxx  20, 40
or 80mg. however, because all of the triptans have
similar potential for coronary vasoconstriction effects[20,56] and, therefore, for chest-related adverse
events, they are all contraindicated in patients with
coronary artery disease or signs and symptoms of
ischaemic heart disease, prinzmetal’s variant angina or uncontrolled hypertension (section 6).[119]
the combined efficacy and tolerability data
from this meta-analysis demonstrate that  xxxd3135xxx 
10mg,  xxxd1976xxx  80mg and almotriptan 12.5mg appear to be more favourable in the treatment of migraine than sumatriptan 100mg.[56] compared with
oral sumatriptan 100mg,  xxxd3135xxx  10mg demonstrated better 2-hour pain relief, sustained absence
of pain (for 24 hours postdose) and consistency of
response, but similar tolerability;  xxxd1976xxx  80mg
afforded better 2-hour pain relief and sustained absence of pain, but similar consistency of response
and tolerability; almotriptan 12.5mg afforded similar 2-hour pain relief, but better sustained absence
of pain, consistency of response and tolerability.

with almotriptan and  xxxd1976xxx  are necessary to
confirm these results.
it is well established that a patient who does not
respond to a particular  xxxd3263xxx  may respond to another.[120-123] furthermore, each  xxxd3263xxx  has slightly
different characteristics, such as time to onset of
pain relief. differences in the pharmacokinetics of
the triptans may be partly responsible for these
variations (table vii); differences between patients
may also be partly responsible.[123] results from a
survey of self-reported migraineurs showed that a
quick onset of pain relief, a decrease in headache
pain and a decrease in the likelihood of headache
recurrence top the list of preferred characteristics
of an acute migraine medication.[124] furthermore,
a patient’s perception of rapid pain relief is in the
range of 30 minutes to 1 hour.[125] patient preference studies, although nonblind or retrospective in
design (section 4.1.7), demonstrated that treatment
with  xxxd3135xxx  10mg was preferred over treatment
with sumatriptan 50 or 100mg,  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg
and naratriptan 2.5mg. where expressed, the main
reason for preference of  xxxd3135xxx  was a rapid onset of pain relief.  xxxd3135xxx  has the shortest tmax
of all the oral triptans (0.7 to 1.5 hours, table vii),
which may account for it having the fastest onset
of action.[121,122]
in conclusion,  xxxd3135xxx  is an effective drug for
the acute treatment of moderate or severe migraine.
oral  xxxd3135xxx  5 and 10mg have shown greater
efficacy than placebo in providing pain relief, an
absence of pain, relief from associated symptoms,
normal functional ability and an improvement in
patient quality of life. earlier results showed that
 xxxd3135xxx  provides faster freedom from pain and
reduces nausea to a greater extent than oral
sumatriptan. more recent studies have shown that
 xxxd3135xxx  10mg provides faster pain relief and a
higher percentage of patients with an absence of
pain and normal functional ability at 2 hours than
naratriptan 2.5mg or  xxxd3562xxx  2.5mg. the efficacy of  xxxd3135xxx  is retained when used in the long
term and the drug is generally well tolerated. although well designed studies comparing  xxxd3135xxx  with almotriptan,  xxxd1976xxx  and frovatripdrugs 2002; 62 (10)

 xxxd3135xxx : an update

tan would further define the position of  xxxd3135xxx 
among the currently available  xxxg1109xxx /1d receptor
agonists, current data suggest  xxxd3135xxx  should be
considered as a first-line treatment option in the
management of migraine.
