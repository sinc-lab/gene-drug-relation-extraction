when osteoclasts adhere to the bone surface, they begin to
polarize and form the ringed structures known as podosomes,
which are mainly composed of f-actin and other cell adhesion
molecules. 4'23 several lines of evidence indicate that multiple
actin-containing dots (ringed structure of f-actin dots: actin ring)
correspond to the clear zone, which surrounds the ruffled border
to seal an extracellular resorbing compartment. 4'23'25 the analysis of the cytoskeleton in osteoclasts revealed that the formation
of actin rings by osteoclasts always preceded the initiation of
bone resorption and that the disruption of preformed actin rings
suppressed the pit-forming activity of osteoclasts. 9't° similar
actin rings are also observed in osteoclasts placed on artificial
surfaces such as glass and plastic dishes as w e l l y
signals mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are thought to regulate the function of osteoclasts.
targeted disruption of the  xxxg2198xxx  proto-oncogene in mice induced
osteopetrosis, a disease characterized by reduced osteoclastic
bone resorption.18 indeed, osteoclasts expressed extremely high
levels of p60 ...... .22 osteoclasts which lack p60 ...... • formed
neither ruffled borders nor resorption pits on dentine slices. ii
inhibitors of tyrosine kinases such as  xxxd2271xxx  and methyl
2,5-dihydroxycinnamate disrupted actin rings of osteoclasts and
inhibited their pit-forming activity. 21,27 these findings indicate
that the  xxxg2198xxx  activity of p60 c ~ ' plays an important
role in the polarization of osteoclasts. the balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the target
proteins in osteoclasts appears important for the regulation of
their function.
bisphosphonates are anti-bone-resorbing agents which prevent bone loss in several metabolic bone diseases including
osteoporosis. 6'7 we previously reported that  xxxd3376xxx  [(4chlorophenyl)thiomethylene bisphosphonate] did not inhibit the
osteoclast-like cell (ocl) formation induced by hx,25- xxxd408xxx  [io~,25(oh)zd3] in cocultures of mouse osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells, but it greatly suppressed
pit-forming activity of ocls placed on dentine slices. 12 we also
showed that  xxxd3376xxx  was incorporated preferentially into
polarized ocls having ruffled borders, and disrupted their actin
rings. 12
recently, schmidt et al. j7 reported that alendronate, an aminobisphosphonate, inhibited the activity of  xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx  e, which was highly expressed in osteoclasts, but that no
other phosphatases such as  xxxg45xxx 
(trap; a marker enzyme for osteoclasts), pyrophosphatase, and

signaling pathways mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation have been reported to be involved in
the regulation of cytoskeletal organization in osteoclasts, the
principal cells responsible for bone resorption. we examined
the effects of  xxxd3376xxx  [(4-chlorophenyl)thiomethylene bisphosphonate] on the cytoskeleton and the balance of  xxxd1075xxx  levels in osteoclast-like multinucleated cells (ocls)
formed in cocultures of mouse osteoblastic cells and bone
marrow cells. when ocls were placed on plastic dishes in
the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum, they formed a ringed
structure of f-actin dots (actin ring) within 2 h.  xxxd3376xxx 
did not inhibit the process of actin ring formation, but it
disrupted preformed actin rings in a time- and a dose-dependent manner. western blot analysis using an antiphosphotyrosine antibody revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of
certain proteins in ocls was stimulated by  xxxd3376xxx 
added to the purified ocls.  xxxg2198xxx  activity of the
p60 ....."immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of the purified
ocls was not affected by  xxxd3376xxx  directly added to the
kinase assay. ocl lysates stimulated dephosphorylation of
tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates such as phosphoneuroprotein 14 and  xxxg681xxx  receptors. like
sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases,  xxxd3376xxx  dose-dependently inhibited tyrosine dephosphorylation of those substrates induced by ocl lysates.
these findings suggest that  xxxd3376xxx  disrupts the preformed actin rings and suppresses bone-resorbing activity by
inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatases in osteoclasts. (bone

 xxxd3376xxx  inhibits protein tyrosine phosphatases

alkaline phosphatase were affected by alendronate in in vitro
assay systems. in this study, we examined how cytoskeletal
organization and tyrosine phosphorylation in ocls were regulated by  xxxd3376xxx .  xxxd3376xxx  disrupted actin rings formed by
ocls placed on plastic dishes, and increased tyrosine phosphorylation levels of proteins in ocls. here, we show that the
increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation in ocls by tiludrohate is due to the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatases. the
inhibitory action of  xxxd3376xxx  on protein tyrosine phosphatases
appears to be involved in disruption of actin rings in ocls.
materials and methods
materials
bacterial collagenase, ia,25(oh)2d 3 and sodium orthovanadate
(orthovanadate) were obtained from wako pure chemicals co.
(osaka, japan). prostaglandin  xxxd2037xxx  (pge2) and enolase were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).  xxxd3376xxx 
was synthesized by sanofi recherche (montpellier, france).
collagen gel solutions (cellmatrix, type i-a) were obtained
from nitta gelatin co. (osaka, japan). pronase was purchased
from calbiochem-novobiochem co. (la jolla, ca). a monoclonal antibody against  xxxd1075xxx  (4g 10) was obtained from
seikagaku co. (tokyo, japan), and a monoclonal antibody
against p60 ......... (mab 327) was purchased from oncogene science inc. (manhasset, ny). [~/-32p]-atp (111 tbq/mmol) was
obtained from new england nuclear (boston, ma).
preparation ~[ ocls
ocls were prepared using ddy mice as described previously.
briefly, primary mouse osteoblastic cells prepared from calvariae
of newborn ddy mice and bone marrow cells from tibiae of
6-9-week-old male ddy mice were cocultured on collagen
gel-coated dishes (dia. 10 cm, corning, corning, ny) in c~-minimum essential medium (o~-mem) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (fbs, cell culture laboratories, cleveland, oh), 1c~,25
(oh)2d 3 (10 ~ mol/l) and pge 2 (10 6 mol/l). ocls were
formed within 7 days of culture. they were released from dishes
by the treatment with 0.2% bacterial collagenase. the cells
obtained from a 10 cm culture dish were centrifuged and resuspended in 10 ml of ~x-mem containing 10% fbs (crude ocl
preparation). it usually yielded 2 - 4 × 104 ocls from the 10 cm
dish. i the purity of ocls in this preparation was about 3%. j the
crude ocl preparation was used for an actin ring formation
assay or further purification of ocls. to purify ocls, the crude
ocl preparation (10 ml) was replated for about 12 h on culture
dishes (dia. 6 cm) in the presence of 10% fbs. the dishes were
then treated with 0.001% pronase and 0.02% edta for 10 rain
to remove osteoblastic cells. 21'24 after the pronase and edta
treatment, more than 85% of the adherent cells on the dishes
were multinucleated and mononuclear cells positive in trap
(marker enzyme of osteoclasts). more than 95% of the total
protein was estimated to be derived from ocls.
actin ring formation in ocls
actin ring formation was assayed as described elsewhere. 15'28
briefly, aliquots of the ocl preparation (200-400 ocls per 0.1
ml/well) were put on 24-well plates containing 0.4 ml/well of
c~-mem with 10% fbs in the presence or absence of  xxxd3376xxx 
(10 4 mol/l). in some experiments,  xxxd3376xxx  at various concentrations was added after incubation for 2-12 h. cells were
incubated for indicated times, fixed for 10 min with 3.7%
formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), and perme-

ated with 0.1% triton x-100 in pbs. to identify ocls, cells
were stained for trap followed by f-actin staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin as described. 12't5'28 the distribution of f-actin was detected with a fluorescence microscope
(olympus, bx-fla, osaka, japan).
western blot analysis
ocls purified on culture dishes were incubated for 7 h with
 xxxd3376xxx  (10 - 4 mol/l) in the presence of 10% fbs. cells were
then rinsed twice with ice-cold ol-mem and scraped into 150 ~l
of  xxxd3215xxx  (sds) sample buffer without [3- xxxd26xxx . the samples were denatured by boiling for 5 rain.
the protein content was determined with a protein assay kit
using bicinchoninic acid with bovine  xxxg124xxx  as standard
(pierce chemical co. rockford, il). equal amounts of proteins
were separated by 4%-20% sds-page, and analyzed by blotting with the antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4g10, 1
~g/ml) and the ecl chemiluminescence reaction (amersham
corp., arlington heights, il).
in vitro kinase assay
p60 ~ ' ' was immunoprecipitated with anti-p60 ........" antibody
(mab327, 2-5 p~g) from purified ocl lysates (500 p,l, i mg of
protein/ml) as described elsewhere. 22 the immune complex was
washed and incubated for 5 min at 25°c with 37 kbq of [,y_32p]_
atp and 1 i~g of acid-denatured enolase in a kinase buffer [20
mmol/l hepes-naoh (ph 7.4), 10 mmol/l mgci~, 40 mmol/l
atp] in the presence and absence of 10 - 4 mol/l  xxxd3376xxx . the
reaction mixtures were subjected to 4%-20% sds-page under
reducing conditions followed by autoradiography.

 xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx  assay
two substrates were used for the  xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx 
assay: phosphorylated phosphoneuroprotein 14 (pnpi4) and a
mixture of tyrosine-phosphorylated enolase and epidermal growth
factor receptors (egfr). pnp14 purified from the rat brain was
tyrosine phosphorylated with the p60 v " " obtained from cell
lysates of sr-3y1 cells transformed with p60 ......." (kindly provided by dr. hanafusa, rockefeller university) as described
previously. ~3'22 egfr was purified from plasma membrane
vesicles of a-431 cells (american type culture collection, rockville, md) as described previously. 16 acid-denatured enolase
(200 ~g) and egfr (10.3 p,g) were incubated for 2 h at 37°c in
0.13 ml of the kinase buffer containing 74 kbq of [',/-32p]-atp
as described elsewhere. 22 the reaction mixture contained both
enolase tyrosine phosphorylated by egfr and autophosphorylated egfr.
to prepare ocl lysates, purified ocls were solubilized in
0.5 ml of a lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/l hepes-naoh
(ph 7.4), 10% glycerol, 4 mmol/l edta, 1 mmol/l dithiothreitol, 1% nonidet p-40, 0.5 mmol/l phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 10 mg/ml of aprotinin. the lysate was centrifuged at
12,000 g for 15 rain and the supernatant was used as the source
of ocl protein tyrosine phosphatases.
the dephosphorylation reaction was carried out at 30°c for
20 rain in a final volume of 20 ~l, containing 5 p~g of the cell
lysate and 5 p~l of either substrate of [32p]-pnpi4 or a mixture
of [32p]-egfr and [32p]-enolase. the reaction was terminated
by adding sample buffer and by boiling for 5 rain. the samples
were subjected to 4%-20% sds-page under reducing conditions followed by autoradiography.

results

we previously reported that  xxxd3376xxx   xxxd1891xxx  - 4 mol/l did not
inhibit ocl formation induced by 10 - s mol/l la,25(oh)zd 3 in
cocultures of mouse osteoblastic cells and bone marrow cells, but
it markedly inhibited the pit-forming activity of ocls when
 xxxd3376xxx  was added directly to the pit formation assay. 12
therefore, this concentration of  xxxd3376xxx  was mainly used in
the present study. when crude ocl preparations were incubated
on plastic dishes in the presence of 10% fbs, most of the ocls
formed actin rings within 2 h (figure 1a, figure 2a).  xxxd3376xxx  (10 4 mol/l) added at the beginning of the culture did not
inhibit the process of actin ring formation by ocls, but it
disrupted the preformed actin rings time-dependently 2 h after
the addition (figure 2a). similarly, when  xxxd3376xxx  (10 4
mol/l) was added to ocl cultures 2 h after ocls were plated,
preformed actin rings in ocls were disrupted gradually (figure
2b).  xxxd3376xxx  dose-dependently disrupted preformed actin
rings, and, for the most part, they disappeared after incubation of
ocls with 10 4 mol/l  xxxd3376xxx  for 16 h (figures 1b, 1c, and
2c). the number of total trap-positive ocls was not significantly changed by the addition of  xxxd3376xxx  to ocl cultures
during the experimental period.
western blot analysis using antiphosphotyrosine antibody
(4g 10) showed a difference in tyrosine phosphorylation in ocls
treated with and without  xxxd3376xxx  (figure 3). a number of
tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected in cell lysates
prepared from the control purified ocls (figure 3, lane 1). the
phosphorylation levels of some proteins (59, 60, and 110 kda)
were increased by the treatment of purified ocls with 10 - 4
mol/l  xxxd3376xxx  (figure 3, lane 2). this suggests that tiludrohate either stimulated  xxxg2198xxx  activity or inhibited protein
tyrosine phosphatase activity in ocls.
osteoclasts express extremely high levels of p60 . . . . . . ",22 therefore, we initially examined whether  xxxd3376xxx  stimulates the
 xxxg2198xxx  activity of p60 ....... by immunoprecipitation from
purified ocls using acid-denatured enolase as substrate. the

 xxxg2198xxx  activity of ocl-derived p60 ........ was not affected
by the direct addition of 10 - 4 mol/l of  xxxd3376xxx  to the kinase
assay (figure 4a). we then examined the effects of  xxxd3376xxx 
on the  xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx  activity of ocls using [32p]_
pnp14 or a mixture of [32p]-egfr and [32p]-enolase as substrates (figure 4b and c). adding lysates prepared from purified
ocls to the reaction mixture containing [3zp]-pnp14 markedly
dephosphorylated the substrate. dephosphorylation of [32p]_
pnp14 by ocl lysates was dose-dependently inhibited by the
addition of  xxxd3376xxx  at concentrations between 10 5 and 10 -3
mol/l (figure 4b). orthovanadate, an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, also inhibited the dephosphorylation of
[32p]-pnp14 induced by ocl lysates  xxxd1891xxx  - 6 mol/l (figure 4b).
when ocl lysates were incubated with a mixture of [32p]-egfr
and [32p]-enolase, the lysates induced dephosphorylation of
[32p]-egfr, but not of [32p]-enolase, suggesting that the protein
tyrosine phosphatases of ocls are substrate-specific. dephosphorylation of [3zp]-egfr induced by ocl lysates was also
inhibited by the addition of  xxxd3376xxx  at concentrations higher
t h a  xxxd1338xxx  - 4 mol/l (figure 4c).
discussion

bone-resorbing osteoclasts are highly polarized cells that form
actin rings and ruffled borders toward the bone surface. 5 similar
actin rings were formed in ocls placed on plastic dishes within
2 h after plating the cells. using an immunoelectron microscopic
technique, we previously showed that vacuolar proton atpase, a
marker enzyme for bone-resorbing osteoclasts, was localized
along the apical membrane at a much higher density than the
basolateral membrane of ocls placed on plastic dishesfl 4 this
suggests that ocls can form actin rings and polarize on plastic
dishes as well.
previously, we showed that the actin ring formation by ocls
placed on dentine slices reached maximum at 8 h. 12 thus, it was
apparent that the actin ring formation occurred more rapidly in
ocls placed on plastic dishes (2 h) than on dentine slices (8 h).
 xxxd3376xxx  did not inhibit the process of actin ring formation by
ocls placed on either plastic dishes or dentine slices, but it
disrupted preformed actin rings soon after the formation reached
maximum. the dose-response effect of  xxxd3376xxx  on the disruption of actin tings in ocls placed on plastic dishes was quite

and stained for trap followed by f-actin staining. trap-positive ocls and those having actin rings were counted separately. the results are
expressed as the percentage of ocls having actin rings relative to the total number of ocls. each point represents the mean ± sem of four cultures.

figure

similar to that of ocls placed on dentine slices) z this indicates
that  xxxd3376xxx  more rapidly affected ocls placed on plastic
dishes than those placed on dentine slices. both the number of
ocls having actin rings and the number of pits formed by ocls
on dentine slices were similarly reduced by the addition of
 xxxd3376xxx  at concentrations between 10 ~' and 10 4 mol/l.~2
these findings suggest that  xxxd3376xxx  specifically affects on
polarized osteoclasts having actin rings even on plastic dishes.
protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is implicated in many biochemical events including cellular cytoskeletal organization, z°
we previously reported that the treatment of ocls with  xxxd2271xxx  disrupted actin rings, inhibited their pit-forming activity, and suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of
o c l s . 2j although  xxxd3376xxx  similarly disrupted actin rings and
inhibited pit formation by ocls, the protein phosphorylation
levels in these ocls did not decrease, but was actually increased
by treatment with  xxxd3376xxx . these results indicate that the
balance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of certain
proteins in osteoclasts may be important for inducing their
bone-resorbing activity. indeed, schmidt et al. ~7 recently reported that inhibitors of protein tyrosine phosphatases, such as
orthovanadate and phenylarsine oxide, inhibited the pit-forming
activity of isolated rat osteoclasts.
tyrosine phosphorylation of three proteins (59, 60, and 110
kda proteins) was increased by incubating ocls with l0 4
mol/l  xxxd3376xxx . however, no appreciable changes in tyrosine
phosphorylation of these proteins were obvious in ocls incubated with  xxxd3376xxx  at concentrations lower than 10 4 mol/l.
more than 60% of ocls placed on plastic dishes had actin rings

in the presence of 10 5 mol/l  xxxd3376xxx  (figure 2c). western
blot analysis using antiphosphotyrosine antibody was not able to
detect such a small change in the cytoskeleton of ocls in our
experiments. we attempted to identify 59, 60, and 110 kda
proteins using several antibodies against tyrosine-phosphorylated
proteins, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and focal adhesion kinase, but all attempts were unsuccessful. further studies are
required to elucidate the role of these tyrosine-phosphorylated
proteins in osteoclast function.
 xxxd3376xxx  did not have any stimulatory effects on the
 xxxg2198xxx  activity of the p60 ~'r~ immunoprecipitated from
ocls. however,  xxxd3376xxx  inhibited the  xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx  activity in the cell lysates of ocls. we used [32p]_
pnp14 and a mixture of [32pj-egfr and [32p]-enolase as the
substrates in our experiments. the inhibitory potency of  xxxd3376xxx  on ocl-derived protein tyrosine phosphatases differed with
the substrates used in the assay. although the dephosphorylation
of [32p]-pnp14 and [32p]-egfr induced by ocl lysates was
dose-dependently inhibited by  xxxd3376xxx , the former was more
sensitive than the latter at inhibiting depbosphorylation of the
tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates.  xxxd1075xxx  residues of
enolase were not dephosphorylated by ocl lysates, indicating
that protein tyrosine phosphatases of ocls possess some substrate specificity.
the dose-response effect of  xxxd3376xxx  on the dephosphorylation of [3~p]-pnp14 was well correlated with the disruption of
actin rings and the inhibition of the pit-forming activity of
ocls) 2  xxxd3376xxx  (10 4 tool/l) effectively inhibited both the

microinjection of 10 4 mol/l of  xxxd3376xxx  into ocls placed on
plastic dishes disrupted actin rings within 20 rain. 12 the intracellular concentration of  xxxd3376xxx  was calculated to be 10 5 to
10 -6 mol/l.12 these results suggest that the intracellular concentration of  xxxd3376xxx  in polarized ocls is relatively high.
these results further support the hypothesis that  xxxd3376xxx  is
efficiently incorporated into ocls having actin rings.

have a common p-c-p structure similar to that of nonhydrolyzable mimetics. 6'7 recently, it was reported that osteoclasts expressed high levels of  xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx  ¢.26 alendronate, an aminobisphosphonate, strongly inhibits protein tyrosine
phosphatase ~ activity in osteoclasts. 17 these findings are consistent with our results showing that  xxxd3376xxx  increased tyrosine phosphorylation levels through the inhibition of tyrosine
phosphatase activity in ocls. therefore, it can be generalized
that the target molecules of bisphosphonates in osteoclasts are
tyrosine phosphatases. imbalance of tyrosine phosphorylation
and dephosphorylation of certain proteins in osteoclasts treated
with bisphosphonates will lead to inhibition of their function.
bisphosphonates have also been reported to inhibit activity of
other enzymes such as  xxxg267xxx   xxxg777xxx  and inositol monophosphatase. 2'3 at present, the precise role of these enzymes in osteo-

[32p]-enolase
4. effects of  xxxd3376xxx  on the  xxxg2198xxx  activity of immunopurified p60 c-~r' and on the  xxxg44xxx   xxxg1870xxx  activity of
ocls. (a) p60 ....... was immunoprecipitated with the anti-p60 c ~r,- antibody (mab327) from cell lysates of the purified ocls. the immune
complex was incubated with acid-denatured enolase and [',/-32p]-atp in
the absence or presence of 10 -4 mol/l  xxxd3376xxx . phosphorylated
enolase and autophosphorylated p60 c-='' were detected by 4 % - 2 0 %
sds-page followed by autoradiography. (b, c) cell lysates prepared
from the purified ocls were incubated with [32p]-pnp14 (b) or a
mixture of [32p]-egfr and [32p]-enolase (c) in the presence of increasing concentrations of  xxxd3376xxx . orthovanadate, an inhibitor of protein
tyrosine phosphatases, was added to some reaction mixtures (b). dephosphorylation of the substrates was detected by 4 % - 2 0 % sds-page
followed by autoradiography.

clast function is not known. how the inhibitory effect of bisphosphonates on the activities of tyrosine phosphatases is related to
osteoclast function is currently not known. further studies are
needed to elucidate how inhibition of the target enzymes, including tyrosine phosphatases by bisphosphonates, is involved in
their inhibitory effects on the functions of osteoclasts.
