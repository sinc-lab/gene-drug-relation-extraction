abstract
previously, we showed that  xxxd226xxx  potently inhibited the growth of myeloma cells and head and neck cancer cells. here,
we demonstrate that  xxxd226xxx  inhibited the proliferation of all the renal cell carcinoma cell lines (achn, a498, caki-2, cos7, and renca) except only one cell line (caki-1) with ic50 of about 2.5–10 lm.  xxxd226xxx  induced a g1 or a g2 -m phase arrest
in these cells. when we examined the eﬀects of this drug on a498 cells,  xxxd226xxx  (2.5 lm) decreased the levels of  xxxg410xxx ,
 xxxg414xxx ,  xxxg366xxx , cyclin e, and  xxxg365xxx  proteins. although p21 protein was not increased by  xxxd226xxx , this drug markedly
enhanced the binding of p21 with  xxxg410xxx . in addition, the activities of  xxxg410xxx - and  xxxg414xxx -associated kinase were reduced in association with hypophosphorylation of rb protein.  xxxd226xxx  (10 lm) also induced apoptosis in a498 cells. apoptotic process
of a498 cells was associated with the changes of  xxxg251xxx  , caspase-9, caspase-3, and caspase-7 proteins as well as mitochondria
transmembrane potential ðdwm þ loss. taken together, these results demonstrate that  xxxd226xxx  inhibits the growth of renal cell
carcinoma cells via cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.

 xxxd226xxx  (as2 o3 ) has recently been reported
to induce complete remission in the patients with relapsed or refractory acute  xxxg1785xxx 
(apl) without severe marrow suppression [1]. although
the mechanism of the antileukemic eﬀect of  xxxd226xxx  is not well understood, it is known that arsenic
trioxide is able to degrade a pml protein and a pml/
rara fusion protein in apl with a tð15; 17þ [2,3]. more
recently, it has been shown that antiproliferative eﬀect
of  xxxd226xxx  is not limited to apl cells but can be
observed in a variety of hematological malignancies
without having the  xxxg1785xxx  protein [4–6],
suggesting that the antiproliferative eﬀect of arsenic
trioxide might be independent of a pml or pml/rara
fusion protein. the accumulating evidences indicated
that  xxxd226xxx  could regulate many biological

functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, diﬀerentiation, and angiogenesis in various cell lines [7]. for
example,  xxxd226xxx  inhibits nb4 apl cells via the
down-regulation of bcl-2 and modulation of pml/
rara fusion proteins [3]. also, we showed that arsenic
trioxide inhibits the growth of myeloma cells and head
and neck cancer cells [4,8,9]. these biological eﬀects may
be mediated by interactions between  xxxd226xxx  and
proteins with a high cysteine content such as pml
protein [10].
the cell cycle in eukaryotes is regulated by cyclindependent kinases (cdks). the cyclins, members of the
cell cycle regulators, bind to and activate cdks. sequential formation, activation, and subsequent inactivation of cyclins and cdks are critical for control of the
cell cycle [11–14]. recently, proteins of a new functional
class that inhibit cdk activity, called cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitors (cdkis), have been identiﬁed. these
cdkis can play a key role in controlling cell cycle

progression by negatively regulating the cdk activities
at appropriate time in the cell cycle [15–18].
apoptosis is an important mode of cell death that
occurs in response to a variety of agents including ionizing radiation or anticancer chemotherapeutic drugs
[19]. in particular, antiapoptotic members of bcl-2
family including bcl-2 and  xxxg251xxx  act to prevent or delay
cell death, while proapoptotic bax and bcl-xs genes
promote the apoptosis [20,21]. several lines of evidence
suggest that interleukin-1-converting enzyme (ice)/
caspase family plays a crucial role in apoptosis [22,23].
especially, caspase-3 has been shown to be a key component of the apoptotic machinery. caspase-3 has been
shown to be activated in apoptotic cells and cleaves
several cellular proteins including poly(adp-ribose)
polymerase (parp) protein, the cleavage of which is a
hallmark of apoptosis.
in the present study, we evaluated the eﬀect of arsenic
trioxide on cell growth inhibition in many renal cell
carcinoma cell lines.
materials and methods
cell lines and culture. renal cell carcinoma cell lines used in this
study were achn, a498, caki-1, caki-2, cos-7, and renca. these
cells were maintained according to the recommendation of the
american type culture collection. cells were grown at 37 °c in an
atmosphere of 5% co2 in air.
reagent.  xxxd226xxx  was purchased from sigma chemical (st.
louis, mo).  xxxd226xxx  was dissolved in 1.65 m naoh at
5  102 m as a stock solution. the maximum concentration of naoh
in culture had no inﬂuence on cell growth of these cell lines.
growth inhibition assay. in vitro growth inhibition eﬀect of arsenic
trioxide on renal cell carcinoma cells was determined by measuring
mtt (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)
dye absorbance of living cells [24]. brieﬂy, cells (2  105 cells per well)
were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates (nunc, roskilde, denmark).
after exposure to the drug for 72 h, 50 ll mtt (sigma) solution (2 mg/
ml in pbs) was added to each well and the plates were incubated for
additional 4 h at 37 °c. mtt solution in medium was aspirated oﬀ. to
achieve solubilization of the formazan crystal formed in viable cells,
200 ll dmso was added to each well before absorbance at 570 nm
was measured.
cell cycle analysis. cell cycle distribution was determined by
staining dna with pi ( xxxd3027xxx  iodide) (sigma). brieﬂy, 1  106 cells
were incubated without  xxxd226xxx  or with  xxxd226xxx  for
72 h. cells were then washed in pbs and ﬁxed in 70% ethanol. cells
were again washed with pbs and then incubated with pi (10 lg) with
simultaneous (rnase) treatment at 37 °c for 30 min. the percentage of
cells in the diﬀerent phases of the cell cycle was measured with facstar ﬂow cytometer (becton–dickinson, san jose, ca) and analyzed
by using becton–dickinson software (lysis ii, cellﬁt).
western blot analysis. samples containing 30 lg total protein were
resolved by a 12% sds–page gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (bio-rad, hercules, ca) by electroblotting, and probed
with anti-p21, anti- xxxg410xxx , anti- xxxg411xxx , anti- xxxg414xxx , anti- xxxg366xxx ,
anti-cyclin e, anti- xxxg365xxx , anti-bcl-2, anti- xxxg251xxx  , and anti-bax antibodies (santa cruz, ca), anti-p27 polyclonal antibody (transduction laboratories, lexington, ky), anti-rb polyclonal antibody
(pharmingen, san diego, ca), and anti-caspase-9, anti-caspase-3,
anti-caspase-7, anti-parp, anti-p-erk, anti-p-jnk, and anti-p-p38
antibodies (cell signaling technology, beverly, ma). the blots

231

were developed by using the ecl kit (amersham, arlington heights,
il).
immunoprecipitation. samples of total protein (100 lg) were incubated with anti- xxxg410xxx , anti- xxxg411xxx , and anti- xxxg414xxx  polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 °c, followed by incubation with protein a–agarose
conjugates (santa cruz) for 1 h. the protein complexes were washed
three times with immunoprecipitation buﬀer [50 mm tris (ph 7.5),
0.5% np-40, 150 mm nacl, 50 mm naf, 0.2 mm navo4 , 1 mm
dtt, 20 lg/ml aprotinin, 20 lg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride] and released from the agarose bead by boiling in
2 sds sample buﬀer [125 mm tris (ph 6.8), 4% sds, 10% b2  xxxd26xxx , 2% glycerol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue] for 5 min
and the reaction mixture was resolved by a 12% sds–page gel,
transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting, and
probed with anti-p21 and anti-p27 antibodies. using the ecl kit one
developed the blot.
kinase reaction assay. total lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti- xxxg410xxx , anti- xxxg411xxx , and anti- xxxg414xxx  polyclonal
antibodies as described above. the beads were washed three times in
immunoprecipitation buﬀer and then three times in kinase buﬀer
[10 mm tris (ph 7.5), 2 mm mgcl2 ]. the kinase reaction was carried
out at 37 °c for 30 min in 25 ll kinase reaction buﬀer containing
2.5 mm egta, 0.1 mm navo4 , 1 mm naf, 20 ll atp, 5 lci
[c-32 p]atp, and 2 lg histone h1 substrate. adding 2 sds sample
buﬀer stopped the reaction. after boiling for 5 min, the reaction
products were electrophoretically separated on a 12% sds–page gel
and phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography.
evaluation of apoptosis. apoptosis was determined by staining cells
with  xxxg166xxx -fitc and pi labeling. to quantitate the apoptosis of
cells, prepared cells were washed twice with cold pbs and then resuspended in binding buﬀer [10 mm hepes/naoh (ph 7.4), 140 mm
nacl, and 2.5 mm cacl2 ] at a concentration of 1  106 cells/ml. then,
5 ll  xxxg166xxx -fitc (pharmingen, san diego, ca) and 10 ll of 20 lg/
ml pi (sigma) were added to these cells, which were analyzed with
facstar ﬂow cytometer (becton–dickinson). mitochondrial transmembrane potential ðdwm ) was determined by ﬂow cytometry. brieﬂy,
cells were washed twice with pbs and incubated with rhodamine 123
(0.1 lg/ml) (sigma) at 37 °c for 30 min. subsequently, pi (1 lg/ml) was
added and rhodamine 123 and pi staining intensity was determined by
ﬂow cytometry.

results and discussion
eﬀect of  xxxd226xxx  on growth inhibition in renal cell
carcinoma cell lines
we examined the eﬀect of  xxxd226xxx  on the cell
proliferation of renal cell carcinoma cell lines using
mtt assay. dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth
was observed in all the cell lines but caki-1 cells with
ic50 of about 2.5–10 lm following the treatment of  xxxd226xxx  for 72 h (fig. 1). the susceptibility to  xxxd226xxx  in renal cell carcinoma cells is lower than
that in leukemia and myeloma cell lines [2–4] and is
similar to that in solid tumors such as human-small-cell
lung cancer, ovarian cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer, and breast cancer cell lines [26, our unpublished
data]. this diﬀerent susceptibility of  xxxd226xxx  on
cell lines might result from cellõs diﬀerent origins. it is
very noticeable that renal cell carcinoma cells were
as much sensitive to  xxxd226xxx  as the other solid

eﬀects of  xxxd226xxx  on the cell cycle in renal cell
carcinoma cell lines

fig. 1. eﬀect of  xxxd226xxx  on the growth inhibition of renal cell
carcinoma cell lines in vitro. exponentially growing cells were treated
with the indicated concentration of  xxxd226xxx  for 72 h. cell
growth inhibition was assessed by mtt assay as described in ‘‘materials and methods.’’ the cellular growth of all the cell lines was
signiﬁcantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. results represent
means of at least four independent experiments; bars, sd.

as shown in table 1, dna ﬂow cytometric analysis
indicated that  xxxd226xxx  induced a g1 or a g2 -m
phase arrest in these cell lines following 72 h of exposure.
whereas a498 cells showed increased cells in the g1
phase, caki-1, cos-7, and renca cells were arrested in a
g2 -m phase of the cell cycle. achn cells showed a few
increased cells in the g2 -m phase. there was little cell
cycle change in  xxxd226xxx -treated caki-2 cells.
 xxxd226xxx  was likely to induce mostly a g2 -m
phase arrest rather than a g1 phase arrest in these cell
lines. a g2 -m phase arrest by  xxxd226xxx  is also
shown in the head and neck cancer cell (pcl-1) and
breast cancer cell (mcf-7) [9,26]. the changes of tubulin polymerization or microtubule network by arsenic
trioxide may cause a g2 -m phase arrest in these cells
[26]. in contrast,  xxxd226xxx  could induce a g1
phase arrest in the a498 cells and myeloma cells [4] and
lymphoid malignant cells [5]. taken together, it is likely

tumors, because it has long been considered that renal
cell carcinoma cells are more resistant to many chemotherapeutic drugs than other solid tumors. we have investigated the mechanism by which  xxxd226xxx 
inhibited cell growth of renal cell carcinoma cells in
terms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

renal cell carcinoma cells. (a) the changes of cell cycle phase distribution in  xxxd226xxx -treated a498 cells. (b) cells were harvested
at the indicated times after incubation with 2.5 lm  xxxd226xxx .
cells were then lysed and the supernatants were subjected to western
blot analysis. aliquots of 30 lg protein extracts were analyzed by 12%
sds–page, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies; p21, p27,  xxxg410xxx ,  xxxg411xxx ,
 xxxg414xxx ,  xxxg366xxx , cyclin e, and  xxxg365xxx .

that  xxxd226xxx  induce a g1 or a g2 -m phase arrest
depending on the cell types.
because  xxxd226xxx  induced deﬁnitely a g1 phase
arrest of cell cycle in a498 cells (fig. 2a), we wanted to
determine the levels of cell cycle-regulated proteins in
this cell line exposed to 2.5 lm  xxxd226xxx . a498
cells treated with  xxxd226xxx  resulted in a downregulation of the protein of  xxxg410xxx ,  xxxg414xxx ,  xxxg366xxx ,
cyclin e, and  xxxg365xxx  (fig. 2b). next, we questioned
whether p21 and p27 could be detected in complexes
with cdks in  xxxd226xxx -treated a498 cells, even
though these proteins were not increased by it. as
shown in fig. 3a, the complexes immunoprecipitated
with anti- xxxg410xxx  antibody showed higher amounts of
immunodetectable p21 protein from arsenic trioxidetreated cells than from control cells. however, p27
protein was not more bound to cdks from arsenic
trioxide-treated cells than from arsenic trioxideuntreated cells.
to determine whether the changed cell cycle regulatory proteins result in the inhibition of cdk activity in
 xxxd226xxx -treated cells, we performed in vitro
cdk activity assay on histone h1 substrate in immunoprecipitates with anti- xxxg410xxx , - xxxg411xxx , and - xxxg414xxx 

233

antibodies. a498 cells treated with  xxxd226xxx 
demonstrated a dramatic decrease of  xxxg410xxx - and
 xxxg414xxx -associated kinase activities on histone h1 substrate compared with  xxxd226xxx -untreated control
cells (fig. 3b). in addition, this decrease of cdk-associated kinase activity was associated with the underphosphorylation of rb protein (fig. 3c), which is
known to sequester the transcription factor, e2f. rbbound e2f suppresses a number of key genes needed for
s phase progression including  xxxg365xxx  that is required
for both s phase progression. therefore the decreased
 xxxg365xxx  by  xxxd226xxx  might be mediated via e2f
sequestered by hypophosphorylation of rb. collectively,  xxxd226xxx -induced g1 phase arrest in a498
cells resulted from the changes of cell cycle-regulatory
proteins.
induction of apoptosis by  xxxd226xxx  in renal cell
carcinoma cell lines
we performed in vitro apoptosis detection assay in
order to know whether  xxxd226xxx  treatment could
induce the apoptosis in renal cell carcinoma cell lines by
facs analysis.  xxxd226xxx  remarkably induced
apoptosis or necrosis in the cos-7, renca, and achn cell
lines tested in our experiment (table 2; sub-g1 and
 xxxg166xxx  staining cell). although  xxxd226xxx 
(2.5 lm) could not induce cell death in a498, caki-1, and
caki-2 cell lines, we could identify that  xxxd226xxx 
(10 lm) could induce cell death in caki-1 and caki-2 cell

lines (data not shown) and a498 cells (fig. 4a). these
results indicate that induction of apoptosis or necrosis can
be another antiproliferative mechanism of  xxxd226xxx  in renal cell carcinoma cells.
concerning the relationship between bcl-2 and bax
regulation during apoptosis of  xxxd226xxx -treated
a498 cells (fig. 4a), bax and bcl-2 proteins were not
changed but  xxxg251xxx  proteins were decreased (fig. 4b).
this result supports the idea that alteration of bcl-2
family proteins is directly or indirectly involved in the
apoptotic eﬀect of  xxxd226xxx  on a498 cells. it has
been suggested that a high ratio of proapoptotic proteins such as bax to antiapoptotic proteins such as bcl-2
and  xxxg251xxx  can cause the collapse of mitochondrial
transmembrane potential ðdwm þ, resulting in releasing
 xxxg569xxx  and apoptosis [25]. in our data, arsenic
trioxide clearly induced the loss of mitochondrial
transmembrane potential ðdwm þ in the a498 cells (fig.
4a), suggesting that apoptosis by  xxxd226xxx  is very
tightly related to or dependent on the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential ðdwm þ. cytochrome
c in cytosol forms an apoptosome that is composed of

 xxxg169xxx  and procaspase-9, resulting in activation of
caspase-9. caspase-9 activates the eﬀector procaspases,
including procaspase-3 and -7, to execute the process of
apoptosis [22]. in particular, many agents transform
caspase-3 from inactive precursors to activated enzymes
during apoptosis. similarly, our data showed that procaspase-9, -3, and -7 were cleaved and activated by  xxxd226xxx . this activation ﬁnally results in
degradation of parp protein, the cleavage of which is a
hallmark of apoptosis. therefore, these results strongly
provide the fact that the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential ðdwm þ and activation of caspase-3
or -7 might be a critical step in  xxxd226xxx -induced
apoptosis. and these results support the fact that mitochondrial transmembrane potential ðdwm ) or caspase3 is very tightly related to the apoptosis by  xxxd226xxx  [1,4,8,26–28].
because the role of mapk (erk, jnk, and p38
map kinase) activity in apoptosis has been extensively
discussed, we want to check out the changes of these
kinasesõ activity. as shown in fig. 4c,  xxxd226xxx 
does not alter the phosphorylated p42/44 erk protein.

fig. 4. eﬀect of  xxxd226xxx  on apoptotic-related proteins and on the mitochondrial transmembrane potential ðdwm þ in a498 cells. (a) arsenic
trioxide (10 lm) increased sub-g1 portion and  xxxg166xxx  staining, and triggered the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential ðdwm þ. cells
were treated without or with  xxxd226xxx  at a dose of 10 lm for 72 h. aliquots of 30 lg of protein extracts were analyzed by 12% sds–page,
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies; (b) bax, bcl-2,  xxxg251xxx  , caspase-9, caspase-3, caspase-7,
and parp. (c) p-erk, p-jnk, and p-p38.

while this drug increased phosphorylated jnk protein,
this drug decreased phosphorylated p38 protein. the
result that activity of jnk was increased in  xxxd226xxx -treated a498 cells was similar to maedaõs result,
showing that  xxxd226xxx  increases the activity of
jnk in human androgen-independent prostate cancer
cells [29]. however, p38 activity decreased by arsenic
trioxide-treated a498 cells is opposite to the results that
p38 activity is increased in  xxxd226xxx -induced apoptosis of human androgen-independent prostate cancer
cells [29], human leukemia u937 cells [30], and vascular
cells [31]. therefore, the roles of mapks in arsenic
trioxide-triggered apoptosis need to be studied more.
in summary,  xxxd226xxx  inhibited the cell proliferation of renal cell carcinoma cell lines by inducing
cell cycle arrest or by triggering apoptosis, especially in
a498 cells. finally, these results suggest that arsenic
trioxide may be a useful drug in the treatment of renal
cell carcinoma patients.
