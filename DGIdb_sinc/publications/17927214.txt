abstract: the 300 kda cation-independent  xxxd1292xxx  receptor ( xxxg1147xxx ) and the 46 kda
cation-dependent mpr ( xxxg1353xxx ) are key components of the lysosomal enzyme targeting system that
bind newly synthesized  xxxd1292xxx  ( xxxd1292xxx )-containing acid hydrolases and divert them from
the secretory pathway. previous studies have mapped two high-affinity  xxxd1292xxx  binding sites of the  xxxg1147xxx  to domains 1-3 and 9 and one low-affinity site to domain 5 within its 15-domain extracytoplasmic
region. a structure-based sequence alignment predicts that domain 5 contains the four conserved residues
(gln, arg, glu, tyr) identified as essential for  xxxd1292xxx  binding by the  xxxg1353xxx  and domains 1-3 and
9 of the  xxxg1147xxx . here we show by surface plasmon resonance (spr) analyses of constructs containing
single amino acid substitutions that these conserved residues (gln-644, arg-687, glu-709, tyr-714) are
critical for carbohydrate recognition by domain 5. furthermore, the n-glycosylation site at position 711
of domain 5, which is predicted to be located near the binding pocket, has no influence on the carbohydrate
binding affinity. endogenous ligands for the mprs that contain solely phosphomonoesters ( xxxd1292xxx ) or
phosphodiesters ( xxxd1292xxx  n- xxxd2683xxx  ester, man-p-glcnac) were generated by
treating the lysosomal enzyme acid r-glucosidase (gaa) with recombinant glcnac-phosphotransferase
and uncovering enzyme (n- xxxd2683xxx -1-phosphodiester r-n-acetylglucosaminidase). spr analyses
using these modified gaas demonstrate that, unlike the  xxxg1353xxx  or domain 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx , domain
5 exhibits a 14-18-fold higher affinity for man-p-glcnac than  xxxd1292xxx , implicating this region of the
receptor in targeting phosphodiester-containing lysosomal enzymes to the lysosome.

lysosomes require a repertoire of over 50 different acid
hydrolases to carry out the degradative metabolism of
proteins and other macromolecules. targeting of newly
synthesized acid hydrolases to lysosomes is dependent upon
specific recognition in the trans golgi network (tgn)1 of
 xxxd1292xxx  ( xxxd1292xxx ) residues on their n-linked
oligosaccharides by two members of the p-type lectin family,
the 300 kda cation-independent  xxxd1292xxx  receptor ( xxxg1147xxx ) and the 46 kda cation-dependent mpr (cdmpr) (1-3). the post-translational modification of lysos†

omal enzymes with  xxxd1292xxx  occurs by a two-step process
(figure 1a). the first enzyme, udp-n- xxxd2683xxx :
lysosomal enzyme n- xxxd2683xxx -1-phosphotransferase (glcnac-phosphotransferase; iubmb accession number  xxxg537xxx .17), acts in early golgi compartments and
attaches n- xxxd2683xxx  (glcnac)-1-phosphate to the
c-6 hydroxyl group of one or more mannose residues to form
a phosphodiester,  xxxd1292xxx  n- xxxd2683xxx 
ester (man-p-glcnac) (figure 1a,b) (4-7). the second
enzyme, n- xxxd2683xxx -1-phosphodiester r-n-acetylglucosaminidase, which is often referred to as the “uncovering enzyme” (iubmb accession number  xxxg1499xxx ),
removes the glcnac moiety in the tgn to generate a
phosphomonoester (figure 1a,c) (8-12). the mprs transport their cargo from the tgn to endosomal compartments
where the acidic environment of the endosome facilitates
the dissociation of the enzyme-receptor complex. the
lysosomal enzymes become packaged into lysosomes, while
the mprs recycle back to the tgn to repeat the process.
the mprs are type i transmembrane glycoproteins. the
large extracytoplasmic region of the  xxxg1147xxx  is composed
of 15 contiguous domains (figure 2a) that display similar
sizes (∼150 residues) and cysteine distributions and exhibit
significant amino acid identity (14-38%) when compared
to each other and to the ∼160-residue extracytoplasmic
region of the  xxxg1353xxx  (13). unlike the homodimeric cdmpr, which contains one  xxxd1292xxx  binding site per polypep-

figure 1: modification of n-glycans on lysosomal enzymes. (a) phosphorylation of mannose residues on n-linked oligosaccharides occurs
in two steps. first, the glcnac-phosphotransferase transfers glcnac-1-phosphate from  xxxd1482xxx  to the c-6 hydroxyl group of mannose
to form a man-p-glcnac phosphodiester. second, the uncovering enzyme removes the glcnac moiety, exposing the  xxxd1292xxx 
phosphomonoester. the five potential sites of mannose phosphorylation are indicated in gray. (b) structure of man-p-glcnac phosphodiester.
(c) structure of  xxxd1292xxx  phosphomonoester. (d) recombinant human gaa isolated from  xxxd2424xxx -treated cho-k1 cells (hm-gaa)
contains seven n-linked oligosaccharides (two-pronged fork symbol) and 1.6 mol of the phosphomonoester  xxxd1292xxx /mol of gaa (empty
circle, empty half-circle). hm-gaa was incubated with glcnac-phosphotransferase (glcnac po4t’ase), resulting in the addition of
5.5 mol of the glcnac phosphodiester man-p-glcnac/mol of gaa (filled circle, filled half-circle). the resulting gaa precursor was
subjected to incubation with either sppap, which removes the phosphate group from phosphomonoesters, or uncovering enzyme, which
removes the glcnac moiety, to generate the gaa diester and gaa monoester, respectively.

tide (14), the  xxxg1147xxx  contains three distinct carbohydrate
binding sites: two high-affinity sites map to domains 1-3
and 9 (15, 16), with essential residues for carbohydrate
recognition residing in domains 3 and 9 (17), and a recently
identified low-affinity site has been localized to domain 5
(18). in contrast to their similar affinities for  xxxd1292xxx  (ki
) 18 and 23 µm, respectively), domains 1-3 and 9 of the
 xxxg1147xxx  exhibit differences in their binding properties to
various mannose-containing glycans (16, 19). although
domain 5 has been shown to have an approximately 300fold lower affinity for  xxxd1292xxx  than domains 1-3 and 9
(18), its carbohydrate binding specificity has not been
determined.
to date, the structures of two out of the four  xxxd1292xxx 
binding sites of the mprs have been determined: the crystal
structure of the extracytoplasmic region of the  xxxg1353xxx  (20,
21) and domains 1-3 of the  xxxg1147xxx  in complex with man6-p (22) revealed the residues that are within hydrogen-

bonding distance to the carbohydrate and demonstrated that
domains 1-3 of the  xxxg1147xxx  exhibit similar folds which are
also similar to that of the extracytoplasmic region of the cdmpr. the structures show that four residues (gln, arg, glu,
tyr) contact the 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyl groups of the mannose
ring. these residues are conserved in the  xxxg1353xxx  and
domains 3, 5, and 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (figure 2b), and
mutagenesis studies have confirmed their critical role in
carbohydrate recognition by the  xxxg1353xxx  and domains 3
and 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (17, 23, 24). however, the role of these
conserved residues (gln, arg, glu, tyr) in carbohydrate
recognition by domain 5 is not known.
in the current study, site-directed mutagenesis and surface
plasmon resonance (spr) analyses were performed to probe
the architecture and ligand specificity of the carbohydrate
binding pocket contained within domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx .
domain 5 mutants containing single amino acid substitutions
were generated to evaluate the role of the conserved gln-

proteins, each with an n-terminal signal sequence, an extracytoplasmic region, a single transmembrane region, and a c-terminal cytoplasmic
domain. the  xxxg1147xxx  has a large extracytoplasmic region comprised of 15 contiguous domains, each ∼150 residues in length. the dom5his
and dom9his constructs contain a substituted n-terminal yeast signal sequence plus a c-terminal tag of six histidine residues. the
glycosylation-deficient, truncated  xxxg1353xxx  construct contains a substituted n-terminal yeast signal sequence, 154 residues of the 159residue extracytoplasmic region, and 6 histidine residues at the c-terminus. only one out of the five n-glycosylation sites (n) is retained
(at position 81), with glutamine (q) substitutions placed at positions 31, 57, 68, and 87. (b) structure-based sequence alignment of domains

n-glycosylation site at position 711 in  xxxd1292xxx  binding. in
addition, the generation of a lysosomal enzyme, acid r-glucosidase (gaa), with defined glycans by enzymatic treatment using recombinant glcnac-phosphotransferase alone
or recombinant glcnac-phosphotransferase plus recombinant uncovering enzyme allowed, for the first time, a
comparison of the binding properties of the two mprs with

an endogenous ligand that contains solely phosphomonoesters ( xxxd1292xxx ) or solely phosphodiesters (man-pglcnac).

a his6 tag (17)) and the cd-mprhis construct (residues
1-154 containing only a single n-glycosylation site at
position 81 plus a c-terminal his6 tag (24)) in the pgapzra
expression vector were described previously.
expression and purification of  xxxg1147xxx  constructs. pichia
pastoris transformants expressing dom5his (18), dom9his
(17), and cd-mprhis (24) were obtained previously. mutant
dom5his cdna constructs encoding single amino acid
substitutions were linearized with bsphi and transformed
into p. pastoris wild-type strain x-33 (invitrogen) by
electroporation, and zeocin-resistant transformants were
selected as described previously (25). positive clones were
inoculated in liquid medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone,
and 2% dextrose), and cultures were harvested after 3 days
of growth at 30 °c. following removal of the cells by
centrifugation, the medium was dialyzed against nickel
binding buffer (20 mm tris, 10 mm imidazole, and 500 mm
nacl, ph 8.0). the dialyzed medium was passed over a
nickel- xxxd2739xxx  (ni-nta) agarose (qiagen)
column, washed, and then eluted with nickel binding buffer
containing 100 mm imidazole (dom9his, dom5his, and
dom5his mutants) or 200 mm imidazole (cd-mprhis).
purified dom5his and dom5his mutants were subsequently
dialyzed against  xxxd2620xxx  (cona) binding buffer
(20 mm tris, ph 7.5, 150 mm nacl, 1 mm cacl2, 1 mm
mncl2, and 1 mm mgcl2) and subjected to cona sepharose
(sigma) affinity chromatography to separate glycosylated
from nonglycosylated species. the glycosylated proteins
were eluted from the column with cona binding buffer
containing 0.5 m methyl r-d-mannoside. the glycosylated

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 44, 2007 12607
proteins were then subjected to ni-nta agarose affinity
chromatography to remove any contaminating cona. all
proteins were extensively dialyzed against mes buffer
(50 mm mes, ph 6.5, 150 mm nacl, 5 mm beta-glycerophosphate, and 10 mm mncl2) and concentrated by filtration
using a 4 ml vivaspin spin column containing a poly(ether
sulfone) membrane with a 5 kda nominal molecular mass
limit. the bradford protein assay (bio-rad) with bovine
 xxxg124xxx  as the standard was used to estimate protein
yields.
endo- xxxg1403xxx  h (endo h) digestion.
purified dom5his or n711q protein was incubated with
endo h (5 mu, roche molecular biochemicals) in buffer
containing 100 mm imidazole, 20 mm tris, and 500 mm
nacl, ph 6.0, at 37 °c for 16 h. the samples were resolved
by sds-page and detected by silver staining as described
by the manufacturer (bio-rad).
purification of human beta-glucuronidase. human beta-glucuronidase was collected from serum-free conditioned medium from cells which overexpress and secrete this lysosomal
enzyme (mtx 3.2 cells were generously provided by dr.
william sly, st. louis university school of medicine, st.
louis, mo). beta-glucuronidase was purified by affinity
chromatography on a  xxxg1147xxx  affigel-10 column to remove
nonphosphorylated enzyme as described previously (26).
generation of recombinant human gaa with glcnac1p-6-man (gaa diester) and  xxxd1292xxx  (gaa monoester). the
gaa diester and the gaa monoester were prepared from
recombinant human gaa with high-mannose-type glycans
(hm-gaa) using recombinant human glcnac-phosphotransferase (27), uncovering enzyme (9), and/or sweet potato
purple acid phosphatase (sppap) (28) in vitro (see figure
1d). hm-gaa was purified from the conditioned medium
of cho-k1 cells stably transfected with recombinant human
gaa cdna (29) that were cultured in the presence of the
r-mannosidase inhibitor  xxxd2424xxx  (2.5 mg/l; industrial
research, new zealand). hm-gaa contains endogenous
phosphomonoester (see figure 5a). the transfer of glcnac1-phosphate to hm-gaa was performed by incubation of
10% (w/w) glcnac-phosphotransferase with gaa in buffer
(50 mm sodium acetate, ph 6.5, 20 mm mncl2, and
0.0002%  xxxd26xxx ) containing 3 mm  xxxd1482xxx 
(roche) for 72 h at 20 °c under an argon atmosphere. this
incubation results in the generation of the gaa precursor
(the “gaa precursor” described in this paper refers to a
glycosylation intermediate, rather than to the newly synthesized form of gaa which has not undergone proteolytic
processing except for removal of the n-terminal signal
sequence (29)). to prepare the gaa diester, the endogenous
phosphate monoester was removed by incubation (48 h) with
sppap (2000 u/mg of gaa) after purification of gaa
precursor from glcnac-phosphotransferase (see below) and
adjustment of the ph to 4.5. to prepare the gaa monoester,
the covering glcnac was removed from the gaa precursor
by incubation (3 h) of 1% (w/w) uncovering enzyme with
gaa precursor. after the reaction, gaa precursor and gaa
monoester were purified from the other proteins (glcnacphosphotransferase and/or uncovering enzyme) by affinity/
size exclusion chromatography on a superdex 200 (ge
healthcare). gaa slows on the superdex 200 since it has a
slight affinity for the dextran backbone of the superdex 200
matrix. gaa diester was purified from sppap by cation

12608 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 44, 2007
exchange chromatography using sp sepharose xl (ge
healthcare) with a kcl gradient in 50 mm sodium acetate,
ph 4.5. the carbohydrate composition of the gaa molecules
was determined after hydrolysis in 4 n tfa at 100 °c for
4 h followed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography (hpaec) separation on a carbopac pa10 (dionex). neutral and amino sugars were separated by isocratic
elution using 15 mm naoh.  xxxd1292xxx  was eluted by a
gradient (60-300 mm) of sodium acetate in 100 mm naoh.
n-glycans were released from gaa molecules using peptide
n-glycosidase f (pngase f; new england biolabs) following the manufacturer’s instructions and separated on a
carbopac pa100 (dionex) by a gradient (5-300 mm) of
sodium acetate in 100 mm naoh to determine the number
of phosphate molecules.
synthesis and purification of [3h]-n-acetylglucosaminyl
6-phosphomethylmannoside diester ([3h]glcnac-r-p-manr-me). [3h]glcnac-r-p-man-r-me was synthesized and
purified following the method described by mullis and
ketcham (30) except that recombinant soluble human
glcnac-phosphotransferase (27) was used as the enzyme
source instead of a lysate derived from the soil amoeba
acathamoeba castellanii. briefly, the molecule was synthesized from udp-[3h]glcnac and methyl r-d-mannoside
(sigma) using glcnac-phosphotransferase and purified by
size exclusion chromatography using sephadex g-25 equilibrated in 7% (v/v)  xxxd3026xxx . the concentration of [3h]glcnac-r-p-man-r-me was determined by carbohydrate
composition analysis.
biosensor studies. all spr measurements were performed
at 25 °c using a biacore 3000 instrument (biacore, piscataway, nj). cm5 research grade sensor chips, surfactant p20,
and amine coupling kits were also obtained from biacore.
purified proteins (beta-glucuronidase, gaa phosphomonoester,
gaa phosphodiester, gaa phosphodiester precursor,
dom5his, dom9his) were immobilized on cm5 sensor
chips following activation of the surface using 1-ethyl-3-[3(dimethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide and n-hydroxysuccinimide as recommended by the manufacturer. briefly, the
proteins were injected onto the activated dextran surface at
a concentration of 10-20 µg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate
buffer, ph 5.0 (except beta-glucuronidase and gaa phosphodiester, for which 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, ph 4.5, was
used), using immobilization buffer (10 mm mes, ph 6.5,
150 mm nacl, and 0.005% (v/v) p20) as the running buffer.
after coupling, unreacted n-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups
were blocked with ethanolamine. the reference surface was
treated in the same way except that protein was omitted.
samples of purified proteins (dom5his, dom5his mutants
(q644e, r687k, e709q, n711q, and y714f), dom9his,
cd-mprhis, gaa phosphomonoester, gaa phosphodiester) were prepared in running buffer (50 mm mes, ph
6.5, 150 mm nacl, 10 mm mncl2, 5 mm beta-glycerophosphate, and 0.005% (v/v) p20) and were injected in a volume
of 80 µl over the coupled and reference flow cells at a flow
rate of 40 µl/min. after 2 min, the solutions containing the
purified proteins were replaced with buffer, and the complexes were allowed to dissociate for 2 min. the sensor chip
surface was regenerated with a 10 µl injection of 10 mm
hcl at a flow rate of 10 µl/min. the surface was allowed
to re-equilibrate in running buffer for 1 min prior to
subsequent injections. in some experiments, dom5his

chavez et al.
(500 nm) or dom9his (50 nm) was flowed over sensor
surfaces immobilized with either gaa monoester or gaa
diester in the presence of increasing concentrations of glucose
6-phosphate (glc-6-p) (sigma),  xxxd1292xxx  (sigma), or nacetylglucosaminyl 6-phosphomethylmannoside diester. the
response at equilibrium (req) for each concentration of protein
was determined by averaging the response over a 10 s period
within the steady-state region of the sensorgram using the
biaevaluation software package (version 4.0.1). req was
plotted versus the concentration of protein and fitted by
nonlinear regression to a one-site saturation binding model
using the equation y ) (rmax[mpr])/(kd + [mpr]) (sigmaplot version 10.0, systat software, inc.). all response data
were double-referenced (31), where controls for the contribution of the change in refractive index were performed in
parallel with flow cells derivatized in the absence of protein
and subtracted from all binding sensorgrams.
results
site-directed mutagenesis of domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx .
in contrast to the  xxxg1353xxx , which contains a single highaffinity  xxxd1292xxx  binding site, we have recently shown that
the  xxxg1147xxx  contains three different phosphomannosyl
binding sites, two high-affinity sites which map to domains
1-3 and 9 and a low-affinity site that is localized to domain
5 (18). the crystal structure of the extracytoplasmic region
of the  xxxg1353xxx  (20, 21) and domains 1-3 of the  xxxg1147xxx 
complexed with  xxxd1292xxx  (22) revealed the residues within
the binding pocket. the structures show that both the cdmpr and domain 3 of the  xxxg1147xxx  exhibit the same fold
and similar disulfide bonding ( xxxg1353xxx  has three out of the
four disulfide bonds contained within domain 3 of the  xxxg1147xxx ) and use identical residues (gln, arg, glu, tyr) (see
figure 2b) located in virtually the same position in the
binding pocket to contact the 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyl groups
of the mannose ring. a structure-based sequence alignment
(figure 2b) predicts that the other high-affinity binding site
located in domain 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx  will have a threedimensional structure similar to that of domain 3: domain
9 exhibits a similar disulfide bonding pattern and contains
these four conserved residues (gln, arg, glu, tyr), and
mutagenesis studies have confirmed their critical role in
carbohydrate recognition by the  xxxg1353xxx  (23, 24) and
domains 3 and 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (17). the presence of these
four residues in domain 5 at positions equivalent to those
found in the three high-affinity binding sites (figure 2b)
suggests that these residues are key determinants for
carbohydrate recognition by domain 5. the alignment (figure
2b) also reveals that domain 5 is missing two cysteines that
form a critical disulfide bridge within the binding pocket of
the  xxxg1353xxx  (20, 21) and domain 3 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (22). in
place of one of these cysteine residues is a serine residue
that comprises an n-glycosylation site at position 711, which
raises the possibility that the presence of an n-glycan could
affect the ability of domain 5 to bind  xxxd1292xxx . to test these
hypotheses, site-directed mutagenesis was performed to
generate single amino acid substitutions in the dom5his
cdna construct. conservative substitutions were selected
that would significantly perturb hydrogen-bonding potential

figure 3: purification and glycosylation status of dom5his constructs. (a) following ni-nta and cona affinity chromatography, the
purified mpr constructs (3 µg) were resolved on a 12% nonreducing sds-polyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining: lane 1,
wild-type dom5his; lane 2, y714f; lane 3, r687k; lane 4, q644e; lane 5, e709q; lane 6, n711q; lane 7, cd-mprhis; lane 8, dom9his.
(b) enzymatic deglycosylation of purified wild-type dom5his (lanes 1 and 2) and n711q (lanes 3 and 4) was performed by incubating the
protein with (lanes 2 and 4) or without (lanes 1 and 3) endo h for 16 h. the samples were resolved on a 12% nonreducing sdspolyacrylamide gel and visualized by silver staining.

expression and purification of truncated forms of the
 xxxg1147xxx  and  xxxg1353xxx . we previously reported that p.
pastoris yeast is a highly effective heterologous host system
for the generation of functional, soluble forms of the bovine
mprs (16, 18, 24, 25). in the current study, this system was
used to generate truncated, soluble forms of the bovine  xxxg1147xxx  composed of extracellular domain 5 alone (dom5his)
and domain 9 alone (dom9his) and of the bovine  xxxg1353xxx 
(cd-mprhis), each containing a c-terminal tag of six
histidine residues to facilitate purification (figure 2a). the
constructs, which use the promoter from the glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene for constitutive protein
expression, are engineered in-frame with the 89-residue
saccharomyces cerevisiae r-factor signal sequence, resulting
in proteins that are secreted from p. pastoris. the his-tagged
proteins were purified from the culture medium by a singlestep process using ni-nta chromatography. the purified
cd-mprhis contained a predominant glycosylated species
that migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 19 kda
(figure 3a, lane 7), whereas purified dom9his contained
both glycosylated (21 kda) and nonglycosylated (17 kda)
forms (figure 3a, lane 8, and data not shown). the dom5his
proteins migrated on sds-polyacrylamide gels as multiple
bands representing glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms
(data not shown). to evaluate the role glycosylation plays
in  xxxd1292xxx  binding by domain 5, wild-type and mutant
dom5his proteins were subjected to additional affinity
chromatography using cona sepharose. the proteins that
were specifically eluted with methyl r-mannoside (i.e.,
glycosylated species) from cona sepharose were used in
subsequent spr analyses: wild-type dom5his, q644e,
r687k, e709q, and y714f migrated as two major glycosylated species of 19 and 22 kda (figure 3a, lanes 1-5),
whereas n711q, which contains a single n-glycosylation site
at position 591, migrates as a single species of 19 kda
(figure 3a, lane 6). enzymatic deglycosylation of dom5his
and n711q with endo h resulted in a single 15 kda protein,
confirming that the 19 and 22 kda species represent
glycoforms of the receptor (figure 3b).
role of gln-644, arg-687, glu-709, tyr-714, and nglycosylation at position 711 in  xxxd1292xxx  binding by
domain 5. spr analyses were performed to determine the
effect various single amino acid substitutions have on the
binding of dom5his to a lysosomal enzyme, beta-glucuronidase. the overall structure of the mutants was evaluated
by circular dichroism, and no significant differences between

the spectra of the mutants and the wild-type protein were
observed, indicating that the single amino acid substitutions
resulted in no gross structural changes to the receptor (data
not shown). figure 4a shows that the affinity of the n711q
mutant for beta-glucuronidase (kd ) 99 ( 12 µm) does not
differ significantly from that of wild-type dom5his (kd )
91 ( 5 µm), demonstrating that the presence or absence of
an oligosaccharide at position 711 does not influence the
ability of dom5his to interact with a lysosomal enzyme. in
contrast, no detectable binding was observed by the q644e,
r687k, e709q, and y714f mutants (figure 4a). these
results are consistent with our prediction, as derived from
the structure-based sequence alignment of domain 5 with
the high-affinity  xxxd1292xxx  binding sites of the  xxxg1147xxx  (i.e.,
domains 1-3 and 9) and the  xxxg1353xxx  (figure 2b), that gln644, arg-687, glu-709, and tyr-714 are essential residues
for carbohydrate recognition by domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx .
generation of gaa with defined n-glycans. previously,
we have used the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase to
determine the binding affinity of various mutant forms of
the  xxxg1353xxx  and  xxxg1147xxx  (17, 24, 32). we chose human
beta-glucuronidase for our studies since it has been characterized extensively and its crystal structure has been determined
(33). human beta-glucuronidase is heavily glycosylated, with
each subunit of this homotetrameric enzyme containing four
n-linked oligosaccharides, and only two out of the four
n-glycans are preferentially phosphorylated (34). therefore,
as synthesized by mammalian cells, the oligosaccharides of
human beta-glucuronidase are heterogeneous. to probe the
ligand specificity of the mprs with molecules that are
endogenous ligands for the receptors, a novel approach was
taken to generate lysosomal enzymes with n-glycans that
are defined in their phosphomannosyl content.
gaa containing either phosphomonoester (gaa monoester) or phosphodiester (gaa diester) moieties was
generated from recombinant human gaa by in vitro
enzymatic reactions. gaa contains seven n-glycosylation
sites at positions 140, 233, 390, 470, 652, 882, and 925 (35)
that are all efficiently glycosylated, except asn-925, which
exhibits only ∼50% occupancy (internal communication,
genzyme corp.). carbohydrate composition analysis demonstrated that the glycans on recombinant human gaa
isolated from the medium of cho-k1 cells cultured in the
presence of the r-mannosidase inhibitor  xxxd2424xxx  were
exclusively of the high-mannose type (this gaa is referred
to as hm-gaa), with 8.35 mannose residues on average

figure 4: interaction of dom5his constructs with lysosomal
enzymes. spr analysis of dom5his constructs binding to immobilized beta-glucuronidase (a), immobilized gaa phosphomonoester (b), or immobilized gaa phosphodiester (c). beta-glucuronidase, gaa monoester, and gaa diester were immobilized on
the surface of a cm5 sensor chip to a level of 2500, 2500, and
1600 ru, respectively. mpr constructs were injected in a volume
of 80 µl over the sensor surface at a rate of 40 µl/min. after 2
min, the solutions containing the mprs were replaced with buffer,
and the complexes were allowed to dissociate for 2 min. req was
plotted against the concentration of the dom5his construct. various
concentrations of the wild-type dom5his and n711q proteins (10,
20, 40, 80, 120, 200, 240, 280, and 360 µm) were injected over
immobilized beta-glucuronidase (a). only the response obtained at
the highest concentration of the mutants q644e (360 µm), r687k
(80 µm), e709q (280 µm), and y714f (120 µm) is shown in panel
a. various concentrations of the wild-type dom5his and n711q
proteins (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 500 µm) were injected
over immobilized gaa phosphomonoester (b), or immobilized
gaa phosphodiester (c). only the response obtained at the highest
concentration (500 µm) of the mutants q644e, r687k, e709q,
and y714f is shown in panels b and c.

per oligosaccharide. in addition, the analysis demonstrated
the presence of 1.6 mol of  xxxd1292xxx /mol of gaa, or
0.25 mol of  xxxd1292xxx /mol of glycan, which existed exclusively as a phosphomonoester (see figure 1d) as assessed
by separation of the released glycans by charge (figure 5a).
the gaa precursor was generated by enzymatic transfer
of glcnac-phosphate to hm-gaa by glcnac-phosphotransferase (figure 1a, step 1; figure 1d), an enzyme that
has the ability to transfer one or two glcnac-phosphate
groups onto a high-mannose-type glycan (36). the gaa
diester and gaa monoester were generated from the gaa
precursor (figure 1d) by removal of endogenous monoester
by sppap and by removal of covering glcnac using the
uncovering enzyme (figure 1b, step 2), respectively. carbohydrate composition analysis of gaa monoester demonstrated that 5.5 mol of glcnac-phosphate was transferred
to hm-gaa in addition to the 1.6 mol of naturally existing
 xxxd1292xxx . therefore, 1 mol of gaa precursor contains
5.5 mol of diester and 1.6 mol of monoester, and 1 mol each
of gaa diester and gaa monoester contain 5.5 mol of
diester and 7.1 mol of monoester, respectively. separation
by charge of released glycans derived from the gaa
precursor (figure 5b) and the gaa monoester (figure 5c)
demonstrated that the glycans were a mixture of neutral,
monophosphorylated, and bisphosphorylated glycans. gaa
diester and gaa monoester were used as mpr ligands with
defined n-glycans in the following analyses.
spr analyses of the various dom5his constructs were
repeated in which the gaa monoester and the gaa diester
were immobilized on separate flow cells. results similar to
those observed with beta-glucuronidase (figure 4a) were
obtained: the wild-type dom5his and n711q mutant bound
with similar affinities to the gaa monoester coupled surface
(wt, kd ) 72 ( 11 µm; n711q, kd ) 170 ( 7 µm) and
to the gaa diester coupled surface (wt, kd ) 18 ( 2 µm;
n711q, kd ) 61 ( 4 µm), whereas no detectable binding
was observed for the q644e, r687k, e709q, and y714f
mutants to either gaa monoester (figure 4b) or gaa
diester (figure 4c). these results further confirm the
importance of gln-644, arg-687, glu-709, and tyr-714 in
phosphomannosyl recognition by domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx .
furthermore, the results provide additional support for the
lack of involvement of an oligosaccharide at position 711
in carbohydrate recognition by domain 5.
domain 5, unlike domain 9 or the  xxxg1353xxx , binds with
higher affinity to man-p-glcnac than  xxxd1292xxx . surprisingly, our initial analysis of the interaction of dom5his with
the two different gaa glycoforms showed that domain 5
binds with a 4-fold higher affinity to the gaa diester (kd
) 18 ( 2 µm, figure 4c) than to the gaa monoester (kd
) 72 ( 11 µm, figure 4b). this is in contrast to the cdmpr and domain 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx , which previously have
been shown to interact with low affinity to a methyl diester
(man-6-poch3) present on dictyostelium discoideum, but
not mammalian, lysosomal enzymes (19, 37). however, the
binding affinity of the  xxxg1353xxx  or the  xxxg1147xxx  to a
mammalian lysosomal enzyme containing the naturally
occurring glcnac phosphodiester has not been determined.
spr analyses were carried out in which similar amounts of
gaa monoester and gaa diester were immobilized to
separate flow cells and increasing concentrations of dom5his,
cd-mprhis, or dom9his were passed over the sensor

figure 5: charge separation of gaa glycans. high-mannose-type glycans on gaa molecules (a, hm-gaa; b, gaa precursor; c, gaa
monoester) were released by pngase f and separated by hpaec on the basis of negative charge. glycans with different numbers of
phosphomonoester and/or phosphodiester moieties are indicated by boxes. the range of retention time for neutral high-mannose-type glycans
(neutral) was determined using high-mannose-type glycan standards. retention times for the glycans with one or two phosphodiesters
(diester × 1 or diester × 2, respectively) were determined using glycans released from in vitro phosphorylated, but not uncovered,
glycoproteins. retention times for the glycans with one or two phosphomonoesters (monoester × 1 or monoester × 2, respectively) were
determined using glycans released from in vitro phosphorylated and uncovered glycoproteins. the retention time for glycans with one
phosphomonoester and one phosphodiester (monoester × 1 + diester × 1) was marked as in the figure since the signal disappeared after
uncovering. (a) in addition to neutral glycans, hm-gaa contains a small population of endogenously phosphorylated glycans containing
one phosphomonoester. (b) glycans with one or two phosphodiesters were generated by incubation with glcnac-phosphotransferase.
thus, the gaa precursor contains phosphodiesters plus endogenous phosphomonoesters. (c) removal of the glcnac moiety in
phosphodiesters by the uncovering enzyme generated glycans with one or two phosphomonoesters and no detectable phosphodiester.

(2500 and 2300 ru, respectively) of gaa monoester and gaa diester were immobilized on the surface of a cm5 sensor chip. mpr
constructs were injected in a volume of 80 µl over the gaa and reference flow cells at a rate of 40 µl/min. after 2 min, the solutions

surface. the representative sensorgrams (figure 6a,c,e) and
corresponding reciprocal plots (figure 6b,d,f) show strikingly that cd-mprhis (figure 6a,b) and dom9his (figure
6c,d) exhibit significant responses to the gaa monoester
surface and minimal responses to the gaa diester surface
whereas, in contrast, dom5his displays significant interaction
with the gaa diester surface and diminished binding to the
gaa monoester surface (figure 6e,f). the data were
analyzed by nonlinear regression, and the affinity constants

are summarized in table 1. the affinity of dom5his for
the gaa diester (kd ) 18 ( 2 µm) is identical to that
obtained from a sensor surface coupled with a lower density
of gaa diester (i.e., 1600 ru (response units) (figure 4c)
versus 2300 ru (figure 6)) and is ∼24-fold higher than that
observed for the gaa monoester (table 1). in addition, spr
analyses of dom5his, dom9his, and cd-mprhis were
performed at different ph values (i.e., ph 5.5, 6.5, and 7.5).

the interaction between these three different receptors and
either the gaa monoester or gaa diester, demonstrating
that changes in ph did not alter the preference of the receptor
for the phosphomonoester versus the glcna phosphodiester
(data not shown).
the limited interaction of cd-mprhis and dom9his with
the gaa diester surface is consistent with previous reports
(19, 37) (and dahms’s unpublished data) that these carbohydrate recognition sites bind a methyl diester (man-6poch3) with ∼70-fold and ∼250-fold lower affinity,
respectively, than  xxxd1292xxx . however, in this study the
determined affinity constants for cd-mprhis and dom9his
are surprisingly similar for the gaa monoester when
compared to the gaa diester (table 1). since the overall
response (rmax) of cd-mprhis and dom9his to the gaa
diester sensor surface is very low (table 1), we took into
consideration that the gaa diester contains small amounts
of  xxxd1292xxx  monoester. to test this hypothesis, the gaa
precursor was subjected to spr analysis. the results show
that the response level of the precursor is intermediate
between that of the gaa diester and gaa monoester while
the affinity is similar to that of the gaa monoester
(supporting information figure 1). these results are consistent with low levels of monoester present in the gaa
diester to account for the high-affinity interaction, but low
response, observed with cd-mprhis and dom9his.
to further evaluate the interaction of individual binding
sites of the  xxxg1147xxx  with a lysosomal enzyme containing
defined glycans, similar amounts of dom5his and dom9his
were immobilized to separate flow cells on a cm5 sensor
chip and increasing concentrations of gaa monoester and
gaa diester were flowed over the sensor surface. consistent
with the above studies (figure 6), dom9his was specific
for gaa containing phosphomonoesters (kd ) 95 ( 12 nm),
with little interaction observed with the gaa diester (kd )
1.4 ( 1 µm) (figure 7a), while dom5his bound specifically
to the gaa diester surface (kd ) 0.72 ( 0.15 µm) and no
dectectable binding was observed to the gaa monoester
surface (figure 7b). although it is unclear why the measured
affinity of dom5his to the gaa diester differed by 25-fold
from that of the previous experiments in which the gaa
diester, rather than dom5his, was coupled to the sensor chip
(kd ) 18 µm; see figures 4c and 6e,f), the consistent
finding in all of these studies is the ability of domain 5 to
bind preferentially to glcnac phosphodiesters.
to directly measure the binding affinity of dom5his to
 xxxd1292xxx  and man-p-glcnac, dom5his was passed over
the sensor surface containing immobilized gaa monoester
or gaa diester in the presence of increasing concentrations
of  xxxd1292xxx , glcnac-p- xxxd814xxx , or glc-6-p. glc6-p was chosen as a control since it had been shown

similar amounts (1200 and 1100 ru, respectively) of dom9his
(a) and dom5his (b) were immobilized to separate flow cells of

30, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 500, 1000, and 5000 nm) of gaa

rate of 40 µl/min. after 2 min, the solutions containing gaa were

for 2 min. shown are representative sensorgrams at 200, 1000, and

previously to bind with low affinity (kd ) (1-8 × 10-2 m)
to the  xxxg1353xxx  and  xxxg1147xxx  (14). the results demonstrate
that dom5his binds with 14-18-fold higher affinity to manp-glcnac (ki ) 1 mm) than to  xxxd1292xxx  (ki ) 14-18 mm),
with inhibition by glc-6-p being observed only at high
concentrations (i.e., above 10 mm) (figure 8a,b). in
contrast, man-p-glcnac, like glc-6-p, did not inhibit the
interaction of dom9his with gaa at concentrations up to
5 mm (figure 8c,d). taken together, these results demonstrate that, unlike the  xxxg1353xxx  and domain 9, domain 5 of

the  xxxg1147xxx  binds preferentially to lysosomal enzymes
containing phosphodiesters (man-p-glcnac).
discussion
the mprs constitute a highly specific recognition and
delivery system by carrying phosphomannosyl-containing
proteins (e.g., soluble lysosomal enzymes) from the biosynthetic pathway or the cell surface to endosomal compartments
(1-3). the importance of this targeting process in the
generation of lysosomes containing a full complement of
hydrolytic enzymes is evidenced by the existence of over
40 different lysosomal storage disorders, the majority of
which are caused by a deficiency of a single lysosomal
enzyme that results in the accumulation or storage of
undigested endogenous macromolecules within lysosomes
(38-40). enzyme replacement therapy, in which the missing
enzyme is supplied to the patient by intravenous injection
on a weekly basis, has been shown to partially or completely
reverse lysosomal storage in many target tissues. to date,

three (fabry disease, mucopolysaccharidosis i, and pompe
disease) out of the four food and drug administration
approved enzyme replacement therapies target the mprs for
the uptake of the infused  xxxd1292xxx -containing enzyme (41).
in addition to lysosomal enzymes, the repertoire of identified
extracellular ligands of the  xxxg1147xxx  has expanded to include
a diverse spectrum of  xxxd1292xxx -containing proteins (42). for
example, varicella-zoster virus expresses  xxxd1292xxx -containing
viral glycoproteins which function to facilitate the entry of
the virus into mammalian cells via the  xxxg1147xxx  (43, 44),
while the transforming growth factor-beta precursor becomes
activated following its interaction with the  xxxg1147xxx  (45). this
list continues to expand as recent proteomic approaches using
affinity columns containing immobilized  xxxg1147xxx  have
identified new  xxxd1292xxx -containing proteins (46, 47). thus,
an understanding of the molecular basis by which mprs
recognize a diversity of targets may lead to the development
of new and improved therapies for the treatment of lysosomal
storage disorders and other human diseases. in the current

phosphodiester recognition by the mprs
study, the structural elements of domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx 
which are important for carbohydrate recognition were
identified. in addition, the generation of lysosomal enzymes
with defined n-glycans containing either phosphomonoesters
or glcnac phosphodiesters provided unique tools to further
characterize the binding properties of the  xxxg1353xxx  and  xxxg1147xxx .
previous equilibrium dialysis studies demonstrated that the
 xxxg1147xxx  contains two high-affinity  xxxd1292xxx  binding sites
(15) that have been mapped to discrete regions (domains 1-3
and 9) within its extracellular region (16, 48). the crystal
structure of the extracytoplasmic region of the  xxxg1353xxx  (20,
21) and the n-terminal  xxxd1292xxx  binding site of the  xxxg1147xxx 
(22) in the presence of bound  xxxd1292xxx  identified those
residues within hydrogen-bonding distance to this phosphorylated sugar, revealing five residues (corresponding to tyr45, gln-66, arg-111, glu-133, and tyr-143 of the  xxxg1353xxx )
that are conserved between the binding pockets of the two
receptors. a structure-based sequence alignment demonstrated that these residues are also conserved in domain 9,
the other known high-affinity  xxxd1292xxx  binding site, and in
domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (see figure 2b), leading to the
speculation that domain 5 contains a carbohydrate binding
site (18). this hypothesis was confirmed by oligosaccharide
microarray and pentamannosyl phosphate-agarose affinity
chromatography analyses (18). previous mutagenesis studies
demonstrated that four of these residues (corresponding to
gln-66, arg-111, glu-133, and tyr-143 of the  xxxg1353xxx )
are essential for  xxxd1292xxx  binding as substitution of any one
of these residues resulted in a ∼1000-fold decrease in binding
affinity by the  xxxg1353xxx  (24) and domains 3 and 9 of the
 xxxg1147xxx  (17). in the current study, these conserved residues
(gln-644, arg-687, glu-709, and tyr-714) were also found
to be critical for  xxxd1292xxx  binding by domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (figure 4). thus, all of the  xxxd1292xxx  binding sites of
the two mprs share a common feature: four residues (gln,
arg, glu, tyr), which are positionally conserved in the linear
amino acid sequence (figure 2b) and have been shown from
the crystal structure of the  xxxg1353xxx  (20, 21) and domains
1-3 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (22) to be located in identical positions
in the binding pocket and contact the 2-, 3-, and 4- hydroxyl
groups of the mannose ring, are critical determinants for
carbohydrate recognition by the mprs. taken together, these
results suggest that the carbohydrate binding sites of the
mprs arose from a common ancestor, utilizing the same
protein fold and identical residues to bind the mannose ring.
it is interesting to note that the binding pocket architecture
surrounding the phosphate group of  xxxd1292xxx  has not been
conserved: the  xxxg1353xxx  (20, 21) uses asp-103, asn-104,
and his-105, whereas domain 3 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (22) uses
ser-386 and an ordered water molecule to coordinate the
phosphate group of  xxxd1292xxx . the structure-based sequence
alignment indicates different residues may be involved in
phosphate recognition by domains 5 and 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx 
(figure 2b). clearly, the three-dimensional structure of
domains 5 and 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx  will be needed to determine
whether these regions of the receptor have a fold and
mechanism of  xxxd1292xxx  binding similar to those of the cdmpr and domain 3 of the  xxxg1147xxx .
in contrast to the nanomolar affinities observed by domains
1-3 and 9 of the  xxxg1147xxx  for the lysosomal enzyme
beta-glucuronidase (16), domain 5 bound the lysosomal enzyme

biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 44, 2007 12615
with a much lower affinity (kd ) 91 ( 5 µm) (figure 4a).
the observation that domain 5 is missing two cysteines
(figure 2b) that form a critical disulfide bridge within the
binding pocket of the  xxxg1353xxx  (20, 21) and domain 3 of
the  xxxg1147xxx  (22) may provide an explanation for the lower
binding affinity exhibited by domain 5. in place of one of
these cysteine residues is a serine residue that comprises an
n-glycosylation site at position 711. to test the possibility
that the presence of an n-glycan could affect the ligand
binding ability of domain 5, the aspargine residue at position
711 was replaced with a glutamine residue and the mutant
was assayed by spr for its ability to bind beta-glucuronidase,
gaa monoester, and gaa diester. no significant difference
in binding affinity was detected (figure 4), demonstrating
that the presence or absence of an n-glycan at this position
has little influence on the ability of domain 5 to bind a
lysosomal enzyme.
a surprising finding of the current study is the observation
that domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx  binds glcnac phosphodiesters
with a higher affinity than phosphomonoesters (figures 4
and 6-8). binding inhibition studies demonstrated that this
preference is on the order of 14-18-fold (figure 8). this is
in sharp contrast to that observed for the other carbohydrate
binding sites of the mprs that exhibit a strong preference
for  xxxd1292xxx . previously, the ability of the mprs to recognize
phosphodiesters was probed with lysosomal enzymes derived
from dictyostelium discoideum which contain the smaller
methyl phosphodiester,  xxxd1292xxx -och3, a modification not
found on mammalian lyososomal enzymes (49). early studies
using full-length  xxxg1353xxx  and  xxxg1147xxx  showed that the  xxxg1147xxx  (15), but not the  xxxg1353xxx  (37), bound d. discoideum
lysosomal enzymes. however, these results are difficult to
assess since d. discoideum lysosomal enzymes also contain
mannose 6-sulfate (50). binding experiments using man6-p and  xxxd1292xxx -och3 as inhibitors of the individual highaffinity  xxxd1292xxx  binding sites of the  xxxg1147xxx  clarified these
earlier studies and demonstrated that constructs containing
domain 9 were highly specific for the phosphomonoester and
bound  xxxd1292xxx  with a ∼250-fold higher affinity than man6-p-och3, whereas domains 1-3 also preferred  xxxd1292xxx ,
binding  xxxd1292xxx  with a ∼10-fold higher affinity than man6-p-och3 (16, 19). inhibition studies using glcnac-pmanme confirmed the high degree of specificity for the
phosphomonoester  xxxd1292xxx  and no detectable inhibition of
binding of domain 9 was observed with glcnac-p-manme
up to concentrations of 5 mm (figure 8). previous qualitative
studies in which oligosaccharides containing two glcnac
phosphodiesters were passed over a column containing
immobilized  xxxg1147xxx  showed no significant interaction with
the receptor (36). however, a subsequent study in which
equilibrium dialysis was used to evaluate the interaction of
[3h]glcnac-r-p-man-r-me with the  xxxg1147xxx  estimated an
affinity that was ∼15-fold lower than that observed with [3h] xxxd1292xxx  (15), a finding consistent with our inhibition binding
studies using domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (figure 8). thus, our
studies extend these early reports by demonstrating that
lysosomal enzymes bearing glcnac phosphodiesters can
interact with the  xxxg1147xxx , but not the  xxxg1353xxx . furthermore,
the current studies have identified the region of the  xxxg1147xxx 
(i.e., domain 5) that is responsible for this activity. in
addition, the ability of domain 5 to interact with a glcnac
phosphodiester suggests that the architecture of its binding

12616 biochemistry, vol. 46, no. 44, 2007
pocket surrounding the phosphate moiety must be significantly different from that of the other  xxxd1292xxx  binding sites
to accommodate and form specific contacts with the glcnac
sugar. it is interesting to speculate that the absence of the
two cysteine residues in domain 5, which forms an essential
tether of loops in the binding pocket of the  xxxg1353xxx  (20,
21) and domain 3 of the  xxxg1147xxx  (22), may allow for a more
open binding pocket in domain 5 to accommodate a glcnac
phosphodiester.
although the ability of the  xxxg1147xxx  via domain 5 to
interact with glcnac phosphodiesters in the context of a
lysosomal enzyme has been clearly demonstrated, the impact
of this interaction in the functioning of the  xxxg1147xxx  remains
to be clarified. one possible role involves the targeting of
newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes that are not efficiently
modified by the uncovering enzyme in the tgn, resulting
in the retention of glcnac phosphodiesters on a subset of
lysosomal enzymes. to date, a genetic disease attributable
to a deficiency of the uncovering enzyme has not been
described. this could be due to the ability of the  xxxg1147xxx 
to rescue the phenotype by targeting glcnac-covered
enzymes to the lysosome. another possibility relates to a
report that the  xxxg1147xxx  interacts with gpi-linked molecules,
which is dependent upon a  xxxd1292xxx  diester rather than the
inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate group (51). this interaction with
the  xxxg1147xxx  was speculated to influence the clustering and
subsequent transmembrane signaling of gpi-linked molecules
(51). the gpi portion of mammalian gpi-linked proteins is
quite variable and contains several types of diesters including
 xxxd1292xxx -glcnac (52) and mannose 2-phosphate diesters
(53). thus, it is possible that phosphodiesters other than man6-p-glcnac may serve as high-affinity ligands for domain
5. it is also possible that non-phosphate-containing glycans
may be the preferred ligand for this region of the receptor.
therefore, additional studies will be required to probe
whether other endogenous molecules exist that interact with
high affinity to domain 5 of the  xxxg1147xxx . future studies will
focus on testing these intriguing possibilities and determining
the three-dimensional structure of domain 5.
