mediation of noradrenaline-induced contractions of rat aorta
by the clb-adrenoceptor subtype

research and development division, recordati s.p.a., 20148 milan, italy
1 the subtypes of al-adrenoceptor mediating contractions to exogenous noradrenaline (na) in rat
aorta have been examined in both biochemical and functional studies.
2 incubation of rat aortic membranes with the irreversible xb-adrenoceptor antagonist, chloroethylclonidine (cec: 10 m) did not change the kd of [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  binding in comparison to untreated
membranes, but reduced by 88% the total number of binding sites (b.).
3 contractions of rat aortic strips to na after cec (50 gm for 30 min) incubation followed by
repetitive washing, showed a marked shift in the potency of na and a partial reduction in the maximum
response. the residual contractions to na after cec incubation were not affected by  xxxd3000xxx 

(10 nm).

4 the competitive antagonists  xxxd3000xxx , terazosin, (r)-ym-12617,  xxxd2914xxx , 5-methylurapidil and
spiperone inhibited contractions to na with estimated pa2 values of 9.85, 8.54, 9.34, 7.71, 7.64 and
8.41, respectively.
5 the affinity of the same antagonists for the a1a- and xlb- adrenoceptors was evaluated by utilizing
membranes from rat hippocampus pretreated with cec, and rat liver, respectively. 5-methylurapidil
and  xxxd2914xxx  were confirmed as selective for the mla-adrenoceptors, whereas spiperone was e1bselective.
6 a significant correlation was found between the pa2 values of the a1-adrenoceptor antagonists tested
and their affinity for the oeb-adrenoceptor subtype, but not for the m1a-subtype.
7 in conclusion, these findings indicate that in rat aorta most of the contraction is mediated by
oelb-adrenoceptors, and that the potency (pa2) of an antagonist in this tissue should be related to its
antagonistic effect on this subtype of the ml-adrenoceptor population.

introduction
since the subdivision of a,-adrenoceptors into aia- and mibsubtypes (morrow & creese, 1986; han et al., 1987a,b), the
subtype(s) of al-adrenoceptor present in rat aorta have been
variously classified as a1b (han et al., 1990; eltze & boer,
1992) both mia and mib (tian et al., 1990) or atypical
(muramatsu et al., 1991; oriowo et al., 1992).
recently, aboud et al. (1993) stated that contractions of
rat aorta induced by noradrenaline (na) are mediated by
non-a1a, non aib-adrenoceptors, due both to the high potency
of the mia-selective antagonists and the sensitivity to the
selective mlb-adrenoceptor  xxxd3249xxx , chloroethylclonidine (cec) (han et al., 1987a).
this paper describes our attempts to characterize the aadrenoceptor(s) in rat aorta by use of cec both in
biochemical and functional studies. in addition, since no
absolutely subtype-selective antagonists are available, the
potency of several al-adrenoceptor antagonists on rat aorta
was also evaluated and compared to their affinity for the miaand mb-adrenoceptor subtypes determined in rat hippocampus pretreated with cec and rat liver, respectively. some of
the affinities of the antagonists for the al-adrenoceptor subtypes were previously published by our group (testa et al.,
1993; taddei et al., 1993).

methods
male sprague dawley rats (300-450 g) were obtained from
charles river italia.

radioligand binding in rat aortic membranes
preparation of membranes rats were killed by cervical dislocation and the thoracic aorta dissected, washed in saline
and homogenized in 50 vols of 50 mm tris-hcl buffer
(ph 7.4) in a polytron (speed 7, 2 x 20 s). the homogenate
obtained was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth,
divided in two parts and centrifuged at 49000 g for 10 min.
the pellets were resuspended in 50 vol of the ice-cold buffer,
incubated for 30 min at 37'c and recentrifuged at 49000 g for
10 min. when the effects of irreversible receptor inactivation
were studied, the buffer contained cec ( xxxd1955xxx ). the pellets
were washed once more in drug-free ice-cold buffer and
finally suspended in 160 vol of tris-hcl.

[3h]- xxxd3000xxx  binding studies aliquots (2 ml) of aortic
membranes were incubated for 30 min at 25'c with different
concentrations of [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  ranging from 0.05 to 8 nm.
non-specific binding was determined in the presence of
10 jlm  xxxd2914xxx . incubations were terminated by vacuum
filtration over 0.2% polyethyleneimine pretreated whatman
gf/b fibre filters using a brandel cell harvester. the filters

were then washed with 3 x 3 ml of ice-cold buffer and the
radioactivity retained on the filters was counted in 10 ml of
filter count (packard) in a liquid scintillation spectrometer
(counting efficiency of 40%).

functional studies using rat aortic strips
spiral strips were prepared from each artery (1 strip per
aorta, fragments about 3 cm long were used) and suspended

in 20 ml organ baths containing krebs bicarbonate buffer of

the following composition (mm): nacl 112.0, kci 5.0, cacl2
2.5, kh2po4 1.0,  xxxd2534xxx  1.2, nahco3 12.0 and glucose
11.1, equilibrated at 37°c with 95% 02: 5% co2 and containing desmethylimipramine (0.1 pm) and corticosterone
(1 gm) to block neuronal and extraneuronal uptake of na,
(±)-propranolol (1 gm) to block p-adrenoceptors and yohimbine (0.1 tim) to block m2-adrenoceptors.
tissues were subject to a passive load of 1.5 g and change
in length measured with isotonic transducers (basile 7006).
tissues were allowed to equilibrate for 60 min and primed
twice with 1opjm na. after washing, the preparations were
equilibrated for a further 60 min and a cumulative
concentration-response curve to na generated (generally
from 1 nm to 100 ytm). following washout of na and reequilibration of the tissue (45 min), the drug to be tested was
added and after 30 min, a second na cumulative
concentration-response curve constructed.
when cec was the test-drug, following the 30 min incubation with the  xxxd3249xxx , the tissues were washed extensively three times (in 0.5 h) before constructing the second
na concentration-response curve. in order to evaluate the
effects of  xxxd3000xxx  in tissues previously treated with cec,
vascular preparations, subjected to the same protocol as
above and after developing the second na concentrationresponse curve, were washed with drug-free krebs solution.
after re-equilibration (45 min) the tissues were further
incubated for 30 min with the antagonist before generating a
third na concentration-response curve. proper control
preparations treated with cec and following vehicle incubation were prepared to verify any time-dependent change of
na response.
vascular endothelium was not specifically removed; however, no particular care was taken to avoid stretching or
damaging the luminal surface of the vessels, or to preserve its
integrity.

affinity for the ua- and cxb-adrenoceptor subtypes
the affinity of different antagonists for the axa- and axbadrenoceptor subtypes was evaluated by studying their ability
to displace specific [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  binding from membranes of
rat hippocampus pretreated with cec (mia) and rat liver (ab)
according to the method of morrow & creese (1986) and
taddei et al. (1993), respectively.

data analysis
values are arithmetic means ± s.e.mean. saturation binding
data were obtained from pools of rat thoracic aortae, and the
experiments were conducted on four different pools of tissue.
the saturation curves (scatchard analysis) were analyzed
according to the method of munson & rodbard (1980),
using the non-linear curve-fitting programme ligand
(from n.i.h.) to determine the apparent dissociation constant (kd) and maximum number of binding sites (b.) for

[3h]- xxxd3000xxx .
the displacement curves of the antagonists on the mia- and
a1b- adrenoceptor subtypes were analysed by non-linear curve
fitting of the logistic equation according to the method
reported by de lean et al. (1978), utilizing the allfit
programme (from n.i.h.). the icm values and pseudo-hill
slope coefficients were estimated by the programme. the
value for the inhibition constant, ki, was calculated by use of
the cheng & prusoff (1973) equation:
ki= icm/(l + l/kd),
where l is the concentration of [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  used.
in the isolated vascular preparations, 5-10 preparations
were used when the effects of cec were studied, and at least
2 preparations were taken from different animals for each
concentration of the other antagonists tested. only one
antagonist concentration was used for each preparation.

a1b-adrenoceptors mediate rat aorta contractions
the concentration-response curves (before and after
antagonist incubation) were analysed by non-linear curve
fitting of the logistic equation as reported for the binding
studies. the statistical significance of the differences between
the parameters of the control concentration-response curve
and the curve obtained after drug incubation (ecm, slope,
e..), was examined by simultaneous fitting with the considered parameter shared as reported by de lean et al.

(1978).

the dissociation constant of the agonist and the fraction of
receptors inactivated by incubation with cec were evaluated
according to furchgott & bursztyn (1967).
schild-plot parameters (pa2 and slope) were evaluated by
linear regression analysis according to tallarida & murray
(1987). the dose-ratios (drs) (ecm ratios of na) observed
after incubation with the different concentrations of the
antagonists were always corrected for time-dependent
changes in first and second curve locations, determined in
vehicle-treated time-matched control curves. identity of the
experimentally derived drs with a schild plot slope of unity
was assessed by the f test for goodness of fit, according to
munson & rodbard (1980).
correlation analysis between the functional activity of the
antagonists in rat aortic strips and their binding affinities at
al-adrenoceptor subtypes was assessed by least-squares linear
regression.

drugs
the following drugs were used: [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  (7-methoxy-3h:
specific activity 76.2 ci mmol ', batch 2825-078, nen
research product, dupont de nemours italiana);
chloroethylclonidine 2hcl, spiperone hc1, desmethylimipramine hc1, 5-methylurapidil, (research biochemical incorporated, natick, u.s.a.);  xxxd2850xxx  hcl, (-)-noradrenaline
c4h606,  xxxd3000xxx  hc1,  xxxd2914xxx -hcl, corticosterone,
(± )-propranolol hc1, yohimbine hc1, (sigma-aldrich,
italy);  xxxd2718xxx  hc1, and (r)-ym-12617 hco (tamsulosin)
were synthesized in recordati laboratories.
in binding studies, the compounds were dissolved in
 xxxd102xxx . for the isolated vascular preparations,
cec,  xxxd3000xxx , terazosin, and  xxxd2914xxx  were dissolved
in distilled water;  xxxd2718xxx , 5-methylurapidil, and
spiperone were dissolved in aqueous  xxxd1898xxx 
and tween 80 (both 1% v/v final concentration) as 1 mm
stock solutions and further diluted as necessary with distilled
water; (r)-ym-12617 was dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide
and water (1:1) at 1 mm, and further diluted as necessary
with distilled water.

effects of cec on [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  binding in rat aortic
membranes
the incubation of rat aortic membranes with 10 am cec did
not change the kd of [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  binding in comparison to
untreated membranes (kd values were 1.68 ± 0.53 and
1.28 ± 0.33 nm, respectively). in contrast, the total number of
binding sites labelled by [3h]- xxxd3000xxx  were significantly
reduced (by about 88%) from 1.80 ± 0.22 pmol g-1 fresh
tissue (untreated), to 0.22 ± 0.08 pmol g-' (after cec). a
representative scatchard plot of saturation assay in rat aorta
membranes is shown in figure 1.
the nonlinear regression analysis revealed that the data
were best described by a model for one binding site, both
before and after cec incubation.

a

pecm value (- log ecm = concentration that produced
50% of the maximal tension attainable) of 7.35 (range
6.82-7.96), in agreement with that (7.77) reported by ruffolo
& waddel (1982).
the second of the paired control concentration-response
curves to na was, in general, slightly shifted to the right of
the first curve, yielding a dr in the range 1.3-2.5.
the slopes and maxima of these curves were not statistically different.
the na concentration-response curve was partially but
significantly depressed (by about 25%) and markedly shifted
to the right after 30 min incubation (followed by repetitive
washout) with 50 gm cec (figure 2).
the plot of reciprocals of equieffective na concentrations
before and after cec incubation (not shown), according to
the method of furchgott & bursztyn (1967), enabled calculation of ka and the fraction (q) of the initial receptor pool
remaining after receptor inactivation. the pka value (4.15;
-log ka, m) estimated for the agonist was clearly different
from that previously reported (6.58) by other authors utilizing dibenamine as an irreversible antagonist (ruffolo &
waddel, 1982). the number of remaining receptors
(q = 0.0008; <0.1%) suggests that almost all the adrenoceptors were inactivated by cec.
to verify this hypothesis, the effect of  xxxd3000xxx  (10nm,
30 min incubation) on na-induced contraction of aorta
strips was evaluated in tissues pretreated, or not, with cec.
as shown in figure 3,  xxxd3000xxx  induced a marked shift to the
right (by about 85 fold) of the na concentration-response
curve (corrected dr = 34; apparent pkb = 9.5) in untreated
strips, but was practically inactive on strips previously
treated for 30 min (followed by repetitive washout) with
50 pm cec.
the addition of the calcium entry blocker,  xxxd2718xxx , (up
to 10 pim) caused only a non-significant (in comparison to the
matched control preparations), non-concentration-dependent
rightward shift and a 8-15% depression of the maximum of
the concentration-response curve for the na-induced contractions (figure 4). this suggests that dihydropyridinesensitive ca2" channels are unlikely to be involved in
receptor-effector coupling in this tissue.
in order to confirm the results described above, the
potency of different ax-adrenoceptor antagonists in inhibiting
the noradrenaline-induced contractions of rat aorta was
assessed.
the antagonists caused parallel, concentration-related
shifts to the right of the na concentration-response curves,

without affecting significantly the maximum contraction
caused by the agonist in comparison to that observed in the
matched control preparations. the slopes of the schild plots
obtained with these compounds were found to be close to,
and not significantly different from, unity, suggesting that
simple competitive antagonism occurred.
the calculated pa2 values (slope constrained to unity)
given in table 1 show that  xxxd3000xxx  and (r)-ym-12617 were
the most potent antagonists. it is noticeable that, in our
experimental conditions, spiperone proved more potent than
5-methylurapidil as an antagonist of na-induced contractions.

ale-adrenoceptors mediate rat aorta contractions
summarized in table 2.  xxxd3000xxx  and terazosin showed the
same affinity for the two a,-adrenoceptor subtypes, whereas
5-methylurapidil (figure sa) and (r)-ym-12617 were selective for the aia-subtype, and spiperone (figure 5b) was selective for the mb-subtype.
the pseudo-hill coefficients for the inhibition of [3h] xxxd3000xxx  binding were found to be close to and not
significantly different from unity (not shown), indicating a
simple competitive antagonism.
the investigated antagonists generated a significant linear
correlation between their functional potency in terms of pa2
values evaluated on rat aorta and their binding affinity for
the mb-adrenoceptor subtype, but not with the affinity for
ama-subtype (figure 6). the obtained equations are the following (y = x for identity; in parentheses the s.e. mean of
the slope; r2 = correlation coefficient):
(ala-adrenoceptor) y = 0.978 (±0.031)x; r2= 0.38, ns

fold shift to the right of the na concentration-response
curve, after cec incubation a non-significant shift of the na
curve was observed with the drug. these findings are in
agreement with those reported by oriowo & bevan (1990),
who demonstrated that cec unmasks a non-a-adrenoceptor
site in the rat aorta, insensitive to phenoxybenzamine,
 xxxd3000xxx , wb4101 and yohimbine. the ka value of the
agonist calculated after cec incubation (4.15) is in agreement with these observations.
in fact, it has been reported that the ka of na in this
tissue utilizing dibenamine as irreversible antagonist (ruffolo
& waddel, 1982) is 6.58 and we confirmed this result utilizing
phenoxybenzamine as irreversible antagonist (ka = 6.46; data
not shown). these findings indicate, on the whole, that the
receptors remaining after cec incubation cannot be considered ax-adrenoceptors.
in addition, it is well known that the smooth muscle
contractions elicited by (xa-subtype receptor activation are
dependent on ca2" influx through the dihydropyridinesensitive channels, while contractions elicited by the activation of alb-adrenoceptors are independent of extracellular
ca2+ influx (minneman, 1988; han et al., 1990). in our
experimental conditions, the calcium entry blocker,  xxxd2718xxx  caused only a non-significant, non-dose-dependent
slight rightward shift and depression of the maximum of the
concentration-response curve to na, as reported by han et
al. (1990) after nifedipine incubation.
the competitive antagonists  xxxd3000xxx , terazosin, (r)-ym12617,  xxxd2914xxx , 5-methylurapidil and spiperone
inhibited contractions to na with pa2 values of 9.85, 8.54,
9.34, 7.71, 7.64 and 8.41, respectively. though the present
functional evaluations did not provide the most precise
estimates of the antagonists affinity, owing to the limited
series of experiments and at least in some cases the narrow
range of concentrations tested, the pa2 value of  xxxd3000xxx  (or
the apparent pkb = 9.5) derived is in agreement with
previously reported data showing affinity values (pa2) of
10.42 (hamed et al., 1983), 10.30 (martinotti et al., 1991),
9.89 (muramatsu et al., 1990), 9.45 (aboud et al., 1993) and
10.6 (oriowo et al., 1990). also our pa2 values for  xxxd2914xxx  and 5-methylurapidil are similar to those previously
obtained by other authors (muramatsu et al., 1990; hamed
et al., 1983; aboud et al., 1993).
recently, aboud et al. (1993) stated that contractions of
rat aorta to na are mediated by non-ala, non-mibadrenoceptors, due to the simultaneous presence of sensitivity
to cec (@ib) and to the high potency of selective a1aantagonists. therefore, we evaluated the affinity of the tested
antagonists for the (la-adrenoceptor subtype in rat hippocampal membranes after cec inactivation (morrow &
creese, 1986), and the affinity for the (1b-adrenoceptor subtype in rat liver membranes since this tissue contains mainly
this (x-subtype (garcia-sainz et al., 1992; taddei et al.,
1993). rat aortic membranes were not utilized to evaluate
the affinity for the mib-adrenoceptors because of the low
number of specific binding sites for [3h]- xxxd3000xxx . we
confirmed that  xxxd3000xxx  and terazosin do not discriminate
between the xl-adrenoceptor subtypes, whereas 5methylurapidil and (r)-ym-12617 were confirmed as clearly
the most active on ala-adrenoceptors, and spiperone on mbadrenoceptor subtypes. the selectivity ratios (pki
hippocampus/pki liver) obtained by us with  xxxd2914xxx 
and spiperone (5.5 and 0.04, respectively) were fully in agreement with those previously reported by michel et al. (1989),
who used rat submaxillary gland and liver as sources of o1aand (lb-adrenoceptor subtypes, respectively.
the pa2 values obtained with the antagonists in the course
of our experiments gave significant correlation with their
a lower degree
affinity for the m1b-adrenoceptor, and showed
of correlation with their affinity for the ala-adrenoceptor

subtype.

functional potency correlated better with their binding
affinity for the ala-adrenoceptor than for the alb-subtype
(testa et al., 1993), supporting the soundness of this approach.
in our opinion, all the findings reported in the present
work clearly indicate that in rat aorta most of the contraction to na is mediated by alb-adrenoceptors, and that the
potency (pa2) of an antagonist in this tissue parallels its
receptor binding affinity for this subtype of the axadrenoceptor population.

%b-adrenoceptors mediate rat aorta contractions
note added during revision of the manuscript
in a recent paper, eltze (1994) reported an excellent correlation
between the affinities (pa2 values) of several a,-adrenoceptor
antagonists (including those used in our study) evaluated on guineapig spleen, and their pki values for the rat liver mb-adrenoceptors
(reported by taddei et al., 1993), concluding that the a,adrenoceptor mediating smooth muscle contraction of this tissue-can
be best characterized as being of the b subtype.
furthermore, this author showed a significant correlation between
the affinities (pa2 values) of these antagonists on guinea-pig spleen,
and the affinities (pa2 values) of the same compounds evaluated on
rat aorta, but not with the affinities (pa2 values) evaluated on rat vas
deferens (a tissue expressing the aia-adrenoceptors).
