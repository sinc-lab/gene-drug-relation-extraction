abstract
radiation-induced intestinal injuries, including inflammation
and immune response, remain a limiting factor in the effectiveness of pelvic radiotherapy and in the patient’s quality of life
during and after treatment. peroxisome proliferation-activated
receptor (ppar) agonists are now emerging as therapeutic
drugs for various inflammatory diseases that are characterized
by impaired ppar expression. the purpose of this study was to
investigate the profile of ppar expression in rat colonic mucosa 3 and 7 days after abdominal ␥-irradiation (10 gy). we
tested whether irradiation-induced acute inflammatory response could be modulated pharmacologically with the antiinflammatory properties of 5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ) (250
mg/kg/day), which is a ppar activator. irradiation drastically
reduced mrna and protein levels of ppar␣ and -␥ and of the
heterodimer retinoid x receptor (rxr)␣ at 3 days postirradiation.  xxxd2579xxx  treatment normalized both ppar␥ and rxr␣ expression at 3 days postirradiation and ppar␣  xxxd2274xxx  days. by

bowel damage induced by pelvic or intestinal radiotherapy
affects 80 to 90% of all patients and negatively affects their
quality of life during and after treatment. these radiationinduced intestinal injuries thus continue to limit the effectiveness of radiotherapy (andreyev, 2005). we previously
reported that an inflammatory process induced by abdominal
irradiation (linard et al., 2003) is associated with an imbalance of the th1/th2 adaptive immune response that results
in repression of genes involved in th1 differentiation, cytokine responses (ifn␥) and migratory behavior (grémy et al.,

doi:10.1124/jpet.107.129122.

promoting ppar expression and its nuclear translocation,
 xxxd2579xxx  interfered with the nuclear factor (nf)-␬b pathway, both
by reducing irradiation-induced nf-␬b p65 translocation/
activation and increasing the expression of nuclear factor-␬b
inhibitor (i␬b) mrna and protein. therefore,  xxxd2579xxx  prevents
irradiation-induced inflammatory processes as well as expression of  xxxg2296xxx  ␣, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, inducible  xxxd2738xxx  synthase, and macrophage infiltration. in addition,  xxxd2579xxx  restores the interferon ␥/signal
transducer and activator of transcription (stat)-1 and stat-3
concentrations that were impaired at 3 and 7 days postirradiation and are correlated with  xxxg466xxx -3
repression. collectively, these results indicate that ppar
agonists may be effective in the prevention of inflammatory
processes and immune responses during and after pelvic
radiotherapy.

2006). differentiation toward the th2 pathway requires upregulation of endogenous feedback regulators such as  xxxg466xxx  (socs)-3 in several inflammatory models (seki et al., 2003; li et al., 2006), including
abdominal irradiation (grémy et al., 2006).
one major pathway toward limiting the negative effects of
radiotherapy involves reducing inflammation levels and preventing further episodes. peroxisome proliferator activator
receptors (ppars) belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily
of transcription factors, most of which are ligand-dependent
transcriptional activators. ppars dimerize with the retinoid
x receptor (rxr), and the binding of ppar-rxr heterodimers to ppar response elements (kliewer et al., 1992)

linard et al.

regulates the transcription of target genes. four ppar isotypes have thus far been reported and are commonly designated as ppar␣, ppar, ppar␥, and ppar␦. ppar␥ has
been found to regulate adipocyte differentiation and metabolism (oberfield et al., 1999). it is highly expressed in the
intestinal and colonic mucosa by both epithelial cells and
macrophages but is also present in endothelial cells, vascular
smooth muscle cells and colon tumors (ricote et al., 1998;
sarraf et al., 1999). some ppar␥ agonists have been reported to suppress inflammation effectively by inhibiting
multiple steps in the nuclear factor (nf)-␬b signaling pathway (ricote et al., 1998; delerive et al., 2001).
ppar␥ has recently come under scrutiny as a potentially
important transcription factor that modulates the inflammatory response of monocytes and macrophages, in particular,
by inhibiting the production of  xxxd2738xxx  (inos) and macrophage-derived cytokines, i.e., tnf␣, il-1, and il-6. evidence also indicates that ppar␥ is involved at the transcriptional level in the expression of inflammatory mediators;
it negatively interferes with the nf-␬b and ap-1 signaling
pathways, independently of dna binding (ricote et al.,
1998), and this transrepression mechanism is thought to
be its primary mode of anti-inflammatory action (delerive
et al., 2001). the potentially beneficial effects of synthetic
ppar␥ ligands are thus being studied in both animal
models and humans for their effects on inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis
(kawahito et al., 2000), and irritable bowel disease (dubuquoy et al., 2003). patients with ulcerative colitis, but not
those with crohn’s disease, seem to have reduced levels of
ppar␥ protein in their colonic epithelial lining. katayama
et al. (2003) have suggested similar deficiencies in colitis
mouse models, but only in macrophages of the lamina
propria. these differences notwithstanding, both studies
support the hypothesis that sufficient levels of ppar␥ are
needed to maintain a healthy noninflamed gut. numerous
studies have since reported that various ppar␥-activating
ligands protect against or delay the onset of colitis. accordingly, saubermann et al. (2002) showed that administration of ppar␥ ligands after dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis in mice provided little therapeutic benefit but
that preventive administration protected against colitis
development.
we reasoned that strong ppar activation would normalize
the ppar-mediated gene response that limits the inflammatory process and might therefore prevent the radiation-induced alteration in immune response. we tested this hypothesis with  xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ), a potent ppar␥ ligand
activator. it inhibits inflammation by scavenging free radicals and thus interfering with the  xxxd208xxx  metabolism (tromm et al., 1999) but without inducing nf-␬b activation (wahl et al., 1998). to our knowledge, no study has
reported that irradiation modulates ppar levels. our investigation of ppar expression in a rat abdominal irradiation
model reveals that the ppar gene is extremely sensitive to
radiation. our findings indicate that the ppar activator can
prevent irradiation-induced inflammatory processes in vivo
at the molecular level by modulating the nf-␬b, stat-1,
and stat-3 pathways as well as by cell infiltration and may
thus contribute to restoring a th1 cytokine profile.

materials and methods
animal model. male wistar rats (elevage janvier, le genest
saint-isle, france) weighing 200 to 250 g were housed with food and
water ad libitum. all experiments were conducted in accordance with
the french regulations for animal experiments (ministry of agriculture order number b 92-032-01, june, 2006). anesthetized rats
received a single abdominal dose of 10 gy ␥-irradiation (60co source).
 xxxd2579xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ; generously provided by ferring laboratory, gentilly, france) (250 mg/kg/day corresponding to 130 mg/kg/day active
component) was administered orally once daily for 13 days, starting
7 days before irradiation. rats were divided into four groups (n ⫽ 6):
controls, controls treated with  xxxd2579xxx , irradiated untreated, and
irradiated  xxxd2579xxx -treated. at 3 and 7 days after irradiation, animals
were sacrificed, and colon tissue was dissected. entire colon specimens were taken for immunostaining; mucosa layers, separated
from the muscularis by scraping, were kept at ⫺80°c for protein
extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction
(rt-pcr).
immunostaining. colon tissue samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and then fixed in 40 g/l buffered formaldehyde solution. after dehydration, specimens were embedded in
paraffin and sectioned (5 ␮m).
macrophage detection. sections were dewaxed in xylene, rehydrated by repeated exposure to graded ethanol, and processed to
show macrophages. all sections were then immersed in an endogenous peroxidase blocking solution (3% h2o2) and boiled in 10%
citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. to reduce nonspecific binding,
they were preincubated 10 min at room temperature with the protein
blocker (dako uk ltd., ely, cambridgeshire, uk) and for 1 h with
the antibody binding the activated macrophage marker ed1 (catalog
number mca341; 1:50; serotec, oxford, uk) and then rinsed in 50
mm tris-hcl, 0.3 m nacl, and 0.1% tween 20. the secondary
reagent was the vector elite abc kit (dako uk ltd.). finally, the
slides were treated with a novared kit (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca) for color development and then counterstained with
mayer’s hemalum.
preparation of protein extracts. total proteins were obtained
by colonic mucosa homogenization in a cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo) containing a standard protease inhibitor cocktail. for cytoplasmic and nuclear protein
extracts, small aliquots (⬍0.1 g) were immersed in 1 ml of ice-cold
lysis buffer: 10 mm hepes, ph 7.9, 40 mm kcl, 3 mm mgcl2, 5%
glycerol, 1% igepal, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm
dithiothreitol, and 5 ␮l/ml protease inhibitor cocktail (sigmaaldrich). they were homogenized on ice with a dounce homogenizer,
kept on ice for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 4°c (12,500 rpm) for
20 s. the supernatant of this cytoplasmic extract was collected into
a new tube. the pelleted nuclei were resuspended into 50 to 200 ␮l
of extraction buffer (20 mm hepes, ph 7.9, 420 mm kcl, 1.5 mm
mgcl2, 0.2 mm edta, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 ␮l/ml protease inhibitor cocktail) and kept on ice for 30 min. the nuclear suspension was centrifuged at 12,500 rpm for 15 min at 4°c to collect the supernatants
containing nuclear protein extracts. protein concentrations of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were measured with a modified bradford method from bio-rad s.a (marnes-la-coquette, france). the
samples were then stored at ⫺80°c.
immunoblot analysis. total, cytosolic and nuclear proteins (25
␮g) were boiled in sds and  xxxd26xxx  buffer and then separated on a 120 g/l polyacrylamide gel (nupage gels; invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca) and electroblotted. polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with a blocking solution (50 g/l skimmed
milk in tween 20-pbs containing 1 ml/l tween 20), washed with
tween 20-pbs, and incubated with mouse monoclonal primary antibody directed against ppar␥ (1/200; santa cruz biochemicals,
santa cruz, ca), nf-␬b p65 (1/200; santa cruz biochemicals) and
rabbit polyclonal stat-1 p84/p91 (1/700; santa cruz biochemicals),

irradiation-induced colonic inflammation is reduced by  xxxd2579xxx 
stat-3 (1/300; santa cruz biochemicals), and socs-3 (1/200; santa
cruz biochemicals) for 1 h at room temperature or rabbit polyclonal
ppar␣ (1/200; santa cruz biochemicals), rxr␣ (1/200; santa cruz
biochemicals), and i␬b␣ (1/200; santa cruz biochemicals) overnight
at 4°c. after washing, immunodetection was performed with the
respective horseradish-linked secondary antibodies (1/1000; santa
cruz biochemicals).  xxxg861xxx 
( xxxg861xxx ) or ␤-actin proteins were detected similarly with a rabbit
anti- xxxg861xxx  polyclonal antibody (1/1000; santa cruz biochemicals)
or mouse monoclonal antibody (1/1000; santa cruz biochemicals),
respectively, to verify uniformity in gel loading. chemiluminescence
was detected according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ecl; biorad). mean band densities were quantified with a las 3000 apparatus (fujifilm, tokyo, japan) and normalized to the total amount
of proteins in the control.
transcription factor activation. nf-␬bp65 and ppar␥ activation were assayed with transam nf-␬b and ppar␥ kits (active
motif inc., rixensart, belgium), which include a 96-well plate with an
immobilized oligonucleotide containing the nf-␬b consensus-binding
site (5⬘-gggactttcc-3⬘) for nf-␬b and a ppar response element
(5⬘-aactaggtcaaaggtca-3⬘) for ppar␥. the active form of
nf-␬b and ppar␥ contained in nuclear extract specifically binds to
the oligonucleotide, respectively. the primary antibodies that detect
nf-␬b recognize an epitope on p65 that is accessible only when
nf-␬b is activated and bound to its target dna. the primary antibodies used in the transam ppar␥ kit recognize an accessible
epitope on ppar␥ protein upon dna binding. a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was used for the spectrophotometric quantification.
rt-pcr analysis. the mrna levels of inflammation-related
cytokines and chemokines and of the housekeeping gene  xxxg1075xxx  ( xxxg1075xxx ) were measured by
rt-pcr. total rna was extracted from the colon mucosa samples
with the rneasy kit (qiagen s.a., courtaboeuf, france). rna
purity and integrity were checked by spectrophotometric analysis
and agarose gel electrophoresis. in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions, 1 ␮g of total rna was reverse-transcribed into
cdna with random hexamers and the superscript ii rnase h(invitrogen, cergy-pontoise, france) in a 20-␮l reaction volume.
sybr chemistry (applied biosystems, courtaboeuf, france) was
used to amplify pcr in the abi-prism 7000 detection system (applied biosystems), under the following conditions: 50°c for 2 min,
95°c for 10 min, and 40 cycles at 95°c for 15 s and 60°c for 1 min.
the primer sequences, designed with primer express software (applied biosystems), are listed in table 1.
result expression and statistical analysis. we used the comparative ⌬⌬ct method for relative mrna quantification of target
genes, normalized to an endogenous reference ( xxxg1075xxx ) and a relevant
nonirradiated control, equal to 2⫺⌬⌬ct. ⌬⌬ct is the difference between the mean ⌬ct (irradiated sample) and mean ⌬ct (nonirradiated sample),
where ⌬ct is the difference between the mean ct (genes) and the
mean ct ( xxxg1075xxx ). each sample was monitored for fluorescent dyes,
and signals were regarded as significant if the fluorescence intensity

913

was 10 times higher than the s.d. of baseline fluorescence, defined
as threshold cycles (cts).
all data are expressed as the mean ⫾ s.e.m. for six animals. data
were analyzed by one-way anova followed by a bonferroni test to
determine the significance of the differences.

results
 xxxd2579xxx  prevented an irradiation-induced increase in
cytokine and chemokine expression. ppar activators,
in particular,  xxxd2579xxx , have recently been shown to improve
inflammation in numerous experimental models of colitis
(frieri et al., 2000; rousseaux et al., 2005). ppar␥ is a
negative regulator of macrophage activation (ricote et al.,
1998), and activated macrophages are the major source of
tnf␣, which is both cytotoxic and proinflammatory. we examined the effects of  xxxd2579xxx  on tnf␣ expression. a previous
study in an intestinal inflammatory model found that the
oral dosage of controlled-release  xxxd2579xxx  that was most clinically effective was 100 mg/kg/day (rousseaux et al., 2005). as

fig. 1a shows, irradiation alone results in multiplies tnf␣
expression at 3 and 7 days postirradiation 7 (p ⬍ 0.001) and
2.5 (p ⬍ 0.01) times higher, respectively, than in nonirradiated controls. likewise, the level of  xxxg357xxx , known to recruit
and activate monocytes and macrophages in tissue, tripled
(p ⬍ 0.01) at 3 days (fig. 1b). in addition, because activated
macrophages may be one source of iinos induction, we analyzed inos expression and found that its mrna was 7
times higher than in controls at 3 days postirradiation and 3
times higher  xxxd2274xxx  days (fig. 1c). immunostaining of macrophages confirmed that overexpression of tnf␣,  xxxg357xxx  and
inos was correlated with elevated levels of ed1-positive
macrophages in the lamina propria at 3 and 7 days postirradiation (fig. 1d).  xxxd2579xxx  pretreatment markedly decreased
(p ⬍ 0.05) the irradiation-induced overexpression of tnf␣,
 xxxg357xxx , and inos at 3 days postirradiation and resulted in
normalized (p ⬍ 0.05 versus irradiated nontreated controls)
tnf␣ and inos expression  xxxd2274xxx  days. these results were
consistent with the histological anti-inflammatory benefits of
 xxxd2579xxx , seen in the drastically reduced macrophage infiltration in the colonic mucosa.
effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on irradiation-induced alterations
in the expression of ppar-related genes. to assess the
effects of increasing ppar␥ levels in vivo during the irradiation protocol, we determined these levels after irradiation
1

and treatment (and corrected for the mrna levels of  xxxg1075xxx 
housekeeping gene). in nontreated animals, 10-gy abdominal irradiation induced a significant, even drastic, decrease
in ppar␣ (⫺50%; p ⬍ 0.05) and ppar␥ (⫺60%; p ⬍ 0.01)
(fig. 2, a and b) levels, at 3 days postirradiation compared
with nonirradiated controls. these reductions drove repression (⫺50%, p ⬍ 0.01) of rxr␣ heterodimers (fig. 2c). western blot analysis of total proteins confirmed the irradiationinduced reduction in ppar␥ and rxr␣ expression at 3 days,
indicating that the reduction in ppar protein levels is associated with the reduction in mrna levels. pretreatment with
 xxxd2579xxx  limited repression of both ppar␥ and rxr␣ at 3 days
and contributed to the greater expression, compared with
controls, of both ppar␣ and rxr␣ (both mrna and protein)
 xxxd2274xxx  days postirradiation.
activation of ppars results in a cascade of reactions, including nuclear translocation (delerive et al., 2001; rousseaux et al., 2005). western blot analysis of the cytosol and
nucleus (fig. 3, a–c) thus extended and confirmed the finding that the decreased protein levels led to decreased nuclear
ppar␣ and -␥ and rxr␣ at day 3. by up-regulating mrna
and total protein,  xxxd2579xxx  treatment normalized their translocation levels. in addition, analysis of ppar␥ activation
(fig. 3d) showed that irradiation inhibited by approximately
2-fold the ppar␥ dna-binding capacity at 3 and 7 days. this

data were studied 3 and 7 days after abdominal irradiation (10 gy), and ppar␥ dna-binding activity using transam kit was performed (d) in
 xxxd2579xxx -untreated (䡺) and in  xxxd2579xxx -treated (f) after normalization to the control. the results are representative of six experiments performed on

activation capacity was significantly amplified by  xxxd2579xxx 
treatment  xxxd2274xxx  days postirradiation.
 xxxd2579xxx  attenuated irradiation-related nf-␬b translocation. previous studies suggested that ppars modulate
inflammation through their interaction with the nf-␬b signaling pathway, either by reducing nf-␬b dna binding to
target genes or by inducing the expression of i␬b␣ (delerive
et al., 2000). we therefore used western blotting of nuclear
and cytosolic extracts in the colon to determine whether the
anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd2579xxx  resulted from interference with nf-␬b p65 nuclear translocation after irradiation
(fig. 4a). the results showed that p65 protein levels in the
nucleus doubled after irradiation alone at 3 and 7 days (p ⬍
0.01) without any modification of the nf-␬b p65 protein level
in the cytosol. nonetheless, irradiated animals with  xxxd2579xxx 
treatment had normal nuclear nf-␬b p65 protein levels (p ⬍
0.05 versus irradiated groups) at day 7. nf-␬b dimers, after
translocation into the nucleus, activate appropriate target
genes. in control rats, a basal nf-␬b p65 dna-binding activity was found in the nuclear extracts of the mucosa layer;
it disappeared in the presence of an excess amount of soluble
oligonucleotide containing a wild-type nf-␬b consensusbinding site (data not shown). this finding confirms the
specificity of the p65 dna-binding activity observed. at 3
and 7 days postirradiation, the activity in the nuclear extract
was significantly 2-fold higher than in the control (p ⬍ 0.001)
(fig. 4b).  xxxd2579xxx  treatment reduced significantly the p65
dna-binding activity. these data demonstrated that the total amount of translocated p65 protein by irradiation was

activated, and  xxxd2579xxx  interferes with irradiation-induced increase of p65 dna-binding activity.
the cytosolic sequestration of nf-␬b requires binding to
i␬b inhibitor proteins. irradiation induced a significant decrease in i␬b␣ expression, confirmed for both mrna (⫺30%;
p ⬍ 0.05) and protein (⫺70%; p ⬍ 0.05) in total protein
extract at 3 days postirradiation.  xxxd2579xxx  pretreatment restored the i␬b␣ mrna level at day 3 and was associated with
an i␬b␣ protein level at day 7 that was 5 times higher (p ⬍
0.05) than in the irradiated-only rats. this finding indicates
that  xxxd2579xxx  maintains the nf-␬b p65 protein in cytosol by
regulating i␬b␣ expression (fig. 4c).
 xxxd2579xxx  effect on ifn␥/stat-1 expression. ppars are
known to affect immune response by regulating the th1/th2
balance (mueller et al., 2003). as previously reported (grémy
et al., 2006), abdominal irradiation leads to decreased th1
cytokine ifn␥ expression. figure 5a confirms the drastic
repression of irradiation-induced ifn␥ (⫺75 and 60%, p ⬍
0.01, at days 3 and 7, respectively).  xxxd2579xxx  treatment normalized the ifn␥ expression (p ⬍ 0.05 versus irradiated rats) at
day 7. because ifn␥ signaling serves mainly to activate
stat-1, we sought to determine whether ifn␥ repression in
irradiated mucosa was correlated with stat-1 repression.
western blot analysis showed that stat-1 immunoreactivity
in nuclear and cytosolic extracts was significantly lower at
day 3 than in controls (fig. 5b). at day 7, stat-1 protein
levels in nuclear extracts remained low (p ⬍ 0.05), but in the
animals pretreated with  xxxd2579xxx  treatment, they returned to
normal then (p ⬍ 0.05 versus irradiated).

expression of the socs-3. we focused our attention on
how irradiation might inhibit ifn␥/stat-1 expression. we
considered the possibility that endogenous feedback regulators of cytokine activities, such as socs-1 and socs-3,
might be involved in these events because they have been
identified as negative regulators of the ifn␥/stat-1 pathway (schreiber et al., 2002). we observed no modification of
socs-1 expression postirradiation (fig. 6a). however,
socs-3 expression increased markedly at 3 and 7 days
postirradiation (by multiples of 13 and 3, respectively, p ⬍
0.01 and p ⬍ 0.001). western blot analysis on day 3 confirmed the elevation in the socs-3 protein level (fig. 6b).
 xxxd2579xxx  pretreatment resulted in normal socs-3 mrna and
protein level expressions at day 3 postirradiation.
it is interesting to note that socs-3 has properties enabling it to negatively regulate stat-1 as well as activate
stat-3 (naka et al., 1999). we observed a significant reduction in stat-3 immunoreactivity in nuclear and cytosolic
extracts at day 3 compared with controls (fig. 6c), as well as
repression of radiation-induced stat-1 protein expression.
 xxxd2579xxx  treatment counterbalanced the irradiation-induced
stat-3 repression by elevating stat-3 protein levels in
both cytosol and nucleus at day 3. this stat-3 elevation
remained significant in the cytosol  xxxd2274xxx  days postirradiation.

these data support the hypothesis that ppar ligands establish stat-1 and stat-3 levels by regulating the socs-3
gene.

discussion
the key new findings of this study are that irradiation
targets and modifies ppars expression, demonstrating for
the first time that a synthetic ppar␥ agonist,  xxxd2579xxx , exerts
potent anti-inflammatory effects in the rat colon after abdominal irradiation.  xxxd2579xxx  therapy has been widely used in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease (van bodegraven
and mulder, 2006), and ppar␥, the key receptor for  xxxd2579xxx ,
mediates its main effects in the colon (rousseaux et al.,
2005). in addition to this therapeutic effect of prophylactically administered  xxxd2579xxx , some reports show that in experimentally induced colitis, ppar␥ ligands consistently reduce
lesion despite destruction of the epithelial cell layer
(desreumaux et al., 2001). the utility of  xxxd2579xxx  drugs in
preventing acute enteritis during radiotherapy has been a
much debated subject (rubenstein et al., 2004). the benefic
effect of  xxxd2579xxx  drugs remained controversial because of the
different mechanisms involved in this severe radiation
complication.

in animal models, irradiation-induced intestinal inflammatory processes have previously been characterized by increased cytokine production, including those involved in th2mediated-immune polarization (grémy et al., 2006). ppar␥
ligands have been shown to reduce cytokine expression in
activated macrophages (ricote et al., 1998), an effect that
appears to be independent of ppar␥ expression (welch et al.,
2003). the main cellular sources of ppar␥ in colonic mucosa
are epithelial cells and macrophages (jain et al., 1998). previous studies have suggested that inflammation may affect
ppar␥ expression. in clinical settings, ppar␥ expression in
colonic epithelial cells is impaired in patients with ulcerative
colitis but remains normal in inflammatory cells (dubuquoy
et al., 2003). our analysis of ppar␥ expression revealed its
dramatic impairment at 3 days postirradiation, related,
moreover, to repression of both ppar␣ and the rxr␣ heterodimers. here, however, unlike in ulcerative colitis, the
ppar␥ defect is not due to a general alteration in nuclear
factor expression. these findings suggest that reduced ppar
expression may contribute to the overwhelming colonic inflammation associated with abdominal irradiation. this
acute gastrointestinal inflammation has only recently been
recognized as the source of the gastrointestinal symptoms
that affect quality of life and may even lead to stopping
radiotherapy treatment (andreyev, 2005).
of the different hypotheses for the diminution in ppar␥
levels during inflammation, irradiation-induced alteration of
epithelial cells seems particularly likely and may explain
ppar repression, although no histological differences were
seen after  xxxd2579xxx  treatment. despite alterations of the epithelial cell layer, however, ppar␥ ligands consistently reduce lesion intensity in several colitis models (katayama et
al., 2003; rousseaux el al, 2005). additional mechanisms

d7

may also play a role after irradiation. for example, nitration
of ppar␥ proteins inhibits the ability of the nuclear receptor
to translocate, and the peroxynitrite produced by superoxide
and no radicals may cause this nitration, either directly by
the irradiation-induced production of ros species or indirectly by overexpression of tnf␣ and inos. in a recent
study, some ppar ligands have proved effective against nitration related to rheumatoid arthritis and tnf␣-stimulated
macrophage cell line (shiojiri et al., 2002). we hypothesize
from our findings that the suppression of irradiation-induced
inos overexpression by  xxxd2579xxx  may have contributed to decreasing ppar␥ nitration and resulted in restoring ppar␥
levels, both total protein and in the nucleus.
at this time, nothing at all is known about regulation of
ppar␥ expression. however, evidence suggests that  xxxd2579xxx 
is able to bind ppar␥, activate it, enhance its expression,
and promote its translocation from the cytoplasm to the
nucleus, perhaps in a positive-feedback loop (rousseaux et
al., 2005). this point is particularly important in our irradiation model where the protein ppar␥ normalization induced
by  xxxd2579xxx  was also associated with increased translocation
and a delayed (day 7) activation. it is interesting to note that
 xxxd2579xxx  normalizes both ppar␣ and rxr␣. in reality, the
ppar␥ activation required a cotranslocation with the heterodimer rxr␣ (kliewer et al., 1992) only restored at day 7
by  xxxd2579xxx . these results indicated that the  xxxd2579xxx  beneficial
effect acted by inducing ppars/rxr coexpression. although
the therapeutic efficacy of  xxxd2579xxx  has been recognized in
diverse clinical situations (van bodegraven and mulder,
2006), this agent was originally developed without knowledge of its molecular target. our data may define its efficacy
as the dual activation of ppar␣ and ppar␥.
in vivo studies have shown that ppar␥ ligands suppress

inflammatory response by attenuating cytokine/chemokine
production in mouse models of colitis (desreumaux et al.,
2001; saubermann et al., 2002; katayama et al., 2003).
 xxxd2579xxx  may thus have widespread beneficial effects in our
irradiation model, where the reduction of macrophages resulted in decreased levels of such inflammatory mediators as
tnf␣,  xxxg357xxx , and inos. the beneficial effect of  xxxd2579xxx  on
inflammatory mediators in our study occurred at 3 days
postirradiation, a point at which ppar␣ and -␥ are expressed
only weakly. these data support the hypothesis by crosby et
al. (2005) from their study of ppar␥-deficient macrophages
that ppar␥ is not necessary for the successful inhibition of
inflammatory mediators, in particular, inos, by synthetic
agonists.
ppar activator-repressed inflammatory genes inhibit signaling of nf-␬b transcriptional activity. proposed mechanisms include ppar interaction with the p65/p50 subunit
and thus the inhibition of i␬b protein degradation (delerive
et al., 2000). in this study, the interaction between ppars
and nf-␬b has been restricted to the nf-␬b p65 subunit,
where an activation of the total amount of p65 translocation
induced by irradiation has been observed.  xxxd2579xxx  significantly
reduced irradiation-induced nf-␬b nuclear translocation/acti-

d7

vation. inhibition of p65 translocation by  xxxd2579xxx  was only observed at day 7. kennedy et al. (1999) demonstrated that  xxxd2579xxx 
had no effect on the nf-␬b nuclear translocation. in fact, a
timing issue may have occurred for this discrepancy. the therapeutic value of  xxxd2579xxx  require a ppar translocation into nucleus (seen at day 3 in this study), a recruitment of coactivator
(rousseaux et al., 2005), and a i␬b expression that occurred at
day 3 in this study and its stabilization in cytoplasm (delerive
et al., 2000); the nf-␬b translocation alteration was the
issue of these different steps. in addition, this delayed response is consistent with the hypothesis that ppar␣-mediated inhibition of nf-␬b-driven gene transcription increases
with exposure to ppar ligands (delerive et al., 1999) and
thus suggests a complementary mechanism. nf-␬b activity
is tightly controlled by the degradation of i␬b␣, which sequesters inactive nf-␬b dimers in cytosol. it is interesting to
note that ppar␣ ligands induced i␬b␣ mrna and protein
expression (delerive et al., 2000) when ppar␥ ligands inhibited i␬b-kinase complex activity, thereby both preventing
i␬b␣ degradation and increasing i␬b␣ nuclear traffic (castrillo et al., 2000), without increasing the protein level, as far
as we know. our data show that the marked decrease in i␬b␣
mrna and protein elicited by irradiation was substantially

irradiation-induced colonic inflammation is reduced by  xxxd2579xxx 

impaired by  xxxd2579xxx , and the protein overexpression  xxxd2274xxx  days
confirms that impairment of  xxxd2579xxx  may thus act like dual
ppar␣ and -␥ ligands on nf-␬b signaling by overexpressing
i␬b␣. a discrepancy was observed between the magnitude of
i␬b␣ level (5-fold) and the only 2-fold decrease of p65 activity
at day 7. ppar␥ inhibits nf-␬b-driven transcription by
physically interacting with both p65 and p50 (delerive et al.,
1999); this study was only restricted to p65 activity.
previous reports noted that stat signaling may be involved
in the anti-inflammatory action of ppar ligands (ricote et al.,
1998). in this study, we showed that  xxxd2579xxx  can act at two
points: by restoring or increasing the irradiation-induced modulation of stat-1 correlated with repression of socs-3, which
is the regulator of cytokine signaling involved in the stat
pathway. socs-1 probably inhibits ifn signaling most
strongly, and it acts by suppressing stat-1 phosphorylation
(brysha et al., 2001). socs-3 plays an essential role as a negative inhibitor of il-6 by interfering with stat-3 (ihle, 2001).
however, macrophage activation models indicate that socs-3
overexpression may also inhibit ifn␥/stat-1 signaling (stoiber et al., 2001; ekchariyawat et al., 2005). our study thus
extends previous reports (han et al., 2002; grémy et al., 2006)
that irradiation reduces ifn␥ levels associated with stat-1
signaling. it is tempting to conclude that irradiation-induced
socs-3 can interfere with ifn␥/stat-1 signaling and stat-3.
classic ppar␥ agonists rapidly induce socs-1 and socs-3
transcription, thus suppressing stat phosphorylation and in
turn repressing ifn␥ (chen et al., 2003; park et al., 2003). our
data are not wholly consistent with these reports but indicate
instead that the ppar ligand  xxxd2579xxx  restores ifn␥/stat-1 and
stat-3 levels that were altered by irradiation. based on observations that immune th2 differentiation is enhanced in socs3-transgenic mice, whereas expression of dominant-negative
socs-3 interferes with th2 differentiation (li et al., 2006) and
that irradiation shifts the immune response to th2 cell polarization (grémy et al., 2006), we can hypothesize that socs-3
induction would have a dramatic effect on the immune system.
socs-3 repression by  xxxd2579xxx  may be a key element in minimizing the inflammatory and immune effects of irradiation. weber
et al. (2003) show that ppar agonists initiate t cell immune
response, especially th1 response, by reducing ifn␥/stat-1
signaling. confirming the findings of mueller et al., we demonstrated that the ppar␥ ligand may also regulate induction of a
th2 type immune response notably after irradiation, and we
think that the effects of ppar␥ ligation in immune response are
highly pleomorphic.
