since parenteral ~i-adrenergic stimulation can induce hypokalemia, we postulated that administration of ~i adrenoreceptor agonists by inhalation could induce the same. we
administered the usual clinical doses of three commonly
used bronchodilators to each of six subjects receiving
assisted mechanical ventilation in line with the ventilator:
two ~i-adrenoreceptor agonists,  xxxd2583xxx , 5 percent
solution, and  xxxd2391xxx , i percent solution; and the
anticholinergic agent atropine as a control. each bronchodilator was nebulized over 10 to 15 minutes in random
order, four hours apart, and given to every subject. plasma

m ore than 50 years ago d'silva1,2 described the

hypokalemic action of adrenaline on serum
potassium. more recent studies have revealed that the
hypokalemic effect of adrenaline is independent of
insulin, renin-aldosterone, and renal excretion of potassium. -4-6 the hypokalemic effect of catecholamines
is mediated by the ~2-receptor linked to the sodiumpotassium atpase in skeletal muscle.":" this mechanism explains why the hypokalemic effect is greater
with epinephrine than norepinephrine. 3,11
although it is clear that parenteral administration
of ~2-adrenoreceptor agonists can cause hypokalemia,
several preliminary reports l2- 14 have suggested that
potentially clinically relevant hypokalemia may occur
after inhalation of ~2-adrenoreceptor agonists.
this investigation was undertaken to ascertain
whether hypokalemia can be induced by inhalation of
~2-adrenoreceptor agonists. we studied in six patients
the effects of usual clinical doses of three commonly
used bronchodilators: metaprote renol,  xxxd2391xxx ,
and atropine. we postulated that  xxxd2583xxx  and
 xxxd2391xxx  would induce hypokalemia, while atropine
would not.

plasma potassium showed a mean decline following
administration of each of the three drugs (fig 1). the
decline occurring between 15 and 50 minutes after
drug administration was greatest for  xxxd2583xxx .
the maximum difference in mean plasma potassium
decline between the drugs occurred at 35 minutes
after baseline, at which time the mean decline from
baseline following  xxxd2583xxx  was - 0.56 meq/l,
and the mean decline following both  xxxd2391xxx  and
atropine was - 0.13 meq/l. between 15 and 50
minutes after drug administration, atropine and  xxxd2391xxx  were similar in their mean decline patterns, both
achieving a relatively small mean trough at 40 minutes
after baseline (for  xxxd2391xxx , -0.23 meq/l; for

analyses of variance failed to show that these differences were statistically significant.
the mean decline from baseline plasma potassium

almost three times greater for  xxxd2583xxx  than for
either  xxxd2391xxx  or atropine (see table 1). t tests

 xxxd2583xxx  (p = 0.04) and atropine (p = 0.(01) but
not in  xxxd2391xxx  (p = 0.09). these differences in
significance level can be attributed to the differing
variance estimates for the effect of each drug.

discussion

this investigation was undertaken to ascertain
whether an intracellular shift in potassium can be
induced by inhalation of ~2-adrenoreceptor agonists.
each patient was studied with three different kinds
ofbronchodilators (1) atropine, 1 mg or 0.003 mmole;
(2)  xxxd2391xxx , 2.5 mg or 0.01 mmole; (3)  xxxd2583xxx , 15 mg or 0.03 mmole. both  xxxd2391xxx  and
 xxxd2583xxx  are ~2-adrenoreceptor agonists, while
atropine has no ~2-adrenoreceptor effect
inhaled  xxxd2583xxx  in usual clinical dosage
induced hypokalemia of both statistical and possible
clinical significance. inhaled  xxxd2391xxx  did not induce statistically significant hypokalemia, either due
to small dosage or relatively weak affinity for the p2adrenoreceptor.  xxxd2391xxx  might cause statistically
significant hypokalemia with a larger dose. inhaled
atropine-induced hypokalemia was of clinically insignificant magnitude but did achieve statistical significance. the mechanism by which atropine induced a
decline in serum potassium is not clear and requires
further study for confirmation.
although the level of significance in the decline in
plasma potassium following atropine administration
(p = 0.(01) was greater than that following  xxxd2583xxx  (p = 0.04), the hypokalemia induced by  xxxd2583xxx  (0.56 meq/l) was more pronounced than with
atropine (- 0.13 meq/l). the difference in significance level can be attributed to the differing variance
estimates for the plasma potassium levels following
administration of each drug.
the magnitude of the potassium shifts induced by
 xxxd2583xxx  was fairly modest. one explanation for
the small magnitude of the hypokalemic effect in this
study is a decreased number of ~2-adrenoreceptors in
our patient population secondary to loss of skeletal
muscle mass. all of the subjects participating in the
study had severe muscle wasting. resting oxygen
consumption was measured on different occasions in
three of the subjects and ranged between 130 mllmin
to 160 ml/min, suggesting significantly decreased muscle mass.
another explanation for the modest hypokalemic
effect we observed is tachyphylaxis due to long-term
~2-adrenoreceptor agonist therapy although bronchodilator medications were withheld for at least 24
hours before the study it is possible that this was an
insufficient time to prevent some tachyphylaxis from
occurring.
the time of peak hypokalemic effect varied from
drug to drug (fig 2). however, most of the peaks (17
of 18) were achieved within 40 minutes from baseline.
the individual variation for each drug can be explained

at least in part by a variable rate of drug delivery due
to differing individual minute ventilations.
since h + ion concentration is known to have a
profound effect on plasma potassium concentration, it
is important to control ph when using plasma potassium as an outcome variable. there were no significant
differences among average ph values at baseline or
changes in ph during the study period among the
drugs. thus, ph cannot be considered a confounding
factor with regard to the observed hypokalemia. although insulin also can cause potassium flux into cells,
it is unlikely that such an effect occurred in our
subjects, since they fasted for 12 hours before and
during the study period.
a weakness of our study design is the lack of a truly
negative control exposure. we did not anticipate that
inhaled atropine would be associated with a slight but
statistically significant decline in plasma potassium. in
retrospect, a more appropriate control exposure would
have been nebulized normal saline. since we used a
study design with each subject serving as his own
control, it was not possible to obtain more data
following the administration of nebulized normal saline
solution. once we noted that atropine had caused
some, albeit slight, hypokalemic effect, the conditions
of the subjects had changed considerably from the
time of the initial study and we no longer had access
to all of them. the decline in plasma potassium
associated with inhaled atropine was slight (and perhaps within the range of measurement error). thus,
we are reluctant to accept a hypokalemic potential for
this drug without confirmation of our results by further
stud}t
the results of this study indicate: (1) that the
routinely used inhaled dose of  xxxd2583xxx  can
induce hypokalemia of potential clinical significance;
(2) that the routinely used dose of  xxxd2391xxx  is not
likely to induce significant hypokalemia, either due to
relative lack of potency or weak ~2 effect; and (3) that
relatively low doses of inhaled atropine might induce
mild hypokalemia by an unclear mechanism.
