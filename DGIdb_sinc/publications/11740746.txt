to the editor—we read with interest the publication by dean
et al. [1] and would like to comment on both the reported serovar
j variant and the persistence of chlamydia trachomatis infection. while the cervical persistence of c. trachomatis infection
was being studied, a new variant j genotype, termed “ja” (genbank accession no. af202458), was identified. compared with
the prototype j sequence, there were 7 nucleotide substitutions,
each of which encoded for a change in amino acid. four of
these amino acids were nonconservative; in addition, 6 silent
mutations were found. of interest, we have published the omp1
sequence of another serovar j variant, termed “jv” [2]. however,
our variant and ja were not compared in the article by dean et al.
[1], probably because the sequence of jv had not been submitted
to genbank, although the complete sequence was published [2].
table 1 compares all nucleotide substitutions in serovars ja
and jv with those in serovar j. surprisingly, all mutations reported in ja are also present in jv. in addition, 2 more mutations
are present in jv, both resulting in amino acid changes (variable
segment 1 [vs1] and constant segment 2 [cs2]). as expected
for structural conserved segments, all silent mutations were
found in the constant segments, whereas all amino acid changes
but 1 were identified in the variable segments. the 2 j variants
can also be separated by omp1 restriction fragment–length polymorphism (rflp) genotyping because of the loss of an alui and
a hinfi restriction-enzyme site in vs2. since the differences in
the subsequent rflp pattern are small, careful analysis of the
rflp is warranted. from an epidemiologic point of view, it is
important to observe the spread of specific c. trachomatis serovars and variants. the observed variant jv that was detected in
3 of 93 isolates analyzed [2] in amsterdam might have evolved
from the ja strain identified by dean et al. [1] in seattle.
the persistence of c. trachomatis infections is an important
subject for 2 reasons: persistence of infection is thought to be
associated with the development of late complications in
women, and persistence of infection could potentially reflect
antibiotic resistance. in addition to reducing the prevalence of
c. trachomatis infections, the initiated and advocated screening
programs for c. trachomatis could potentially result in enhanced
antibiotic-resistant c. trachomatis strains. dean et al. [1] found
that 1 of 7 isolates tested had an elevated mic for doxycycline
and azithromycin, compared with 1 control isolate. one could
conclude that antimicrobial resistance does not seem to be a
likely explanation for persistence of infection in these patients.
however, dreses-werringloer et al. [3] showed that standard
determination of mics is not always sufficient to verify that the
antibiotic will eliminate the organism in vivo, since these assays
do not include monitoring of chlamydial persistence. they

showed that failure of eradication often induced a state of chlamydial persistence characterized by the presence of nonculturable but fully viable bacteria and the development of aberrant
inclusions. furthermore, jones et al. [4] showed that resistance
to tetracycline, erythromycin, and clindamycin occurred in c.
trachomatis and may be a factor in some treatment failures.
during the recent international congress of sexually transmitted infections (berlin, 24–27 june 2001), it was shown that
heterotypic resistance may be common and is not induced by
cotreatment of gonorrhea with tetracyclines. in addition, treatment failure was more likely in women infected with heterotypic
resistant strains than in women infected with susceptible isolates
[5]. on the other hand, persistence of infection could represent
reinfection from an untreated partner, although that seemed unlikely in the study by dean et al. [1], given that the infections
occurred over 5–10 years; however, one cannot exclude the fact
that some people had untreated partners. since a significant association of c class serovars with persistent cervical infections
was found, further research to confirm these results are warranted
to investigate if biological properties of c class serovars allow
for persistence.

to the editor—we thank morré et al. [1] for pointing out a variant of prototype serovar j, serovar jv, that was dissimilar to serovar ja, which we reported [2], by 2 amino acid substitutions [3].
there may have been additional differences between ja and jv,
but no sequence data were available for the constant segment 5
region of ompa of jv where ja had 3 additional nucleotide substitutions encoding for an amino acid change. although the jv
strain was found in 3 of 93 isolates, there is insufficient molecular and epidemiologic information available to understand the
evolutionary relationship of the jv and ja strains at the present
time.
jones et al. [4] were the first to report resistance of chlamydia
trachomatis to tetracycline and erythromycin. we found no
significant difference in mics for doxycycline and azithromycin
when the persistent and control strains were tested; yet, subsequent patient samples were culture negative and ligase chain
reaction (lcr) positive. this evidence suggested that the strains
were persistent, as opposed to resistant to the antibiotics used for
treatment.
although we found a significant association between c class
serovars and persistent cervical infections, it is unlikely that
these infections represented reinfection within a core group,
because (1) the isolates came from women seen at many different clinics in the seattle area and during different years; (2) chlamydial persistence occurred over many years; (3) there was a
significantly higher rate of culture-negative, lcr-positive
samples in the persistence group than in the reinfection or control groups; and (4) variant genotypes only arose after treatment
and were very similar to the parent genotype. however, our
sample size was small, and we concluded that “this raises the
question of whether there are particular biologic properties of c
class serovars that allow for persistence” and that “it will be
important to do additional in vitro and animal studies comparing
selected persistent strains, such as those described here, with b
and intermediate class serovars, to determine relative rates of
persistence, differential effects on infectivity, and influence of
antibiotics on rates of gene mutation” [2, p. 915].
the focus of our study was to determine whether there was

besides the investigation of c. trachomatis bacterium, serovars, and antibiotic resistance, an additional variable influencing
the course of c. trachomatis infection must be taken into account: the host genetic background. recent studies of twins and
adoptees have indicated that host genetic factors are major determinants of susceptibility to infectious diseases in humans [6].
the immunogenetics of human infectious diseases has been
reviewed recently by hill [7]. no cytokine gene polymorphism
studies have been published for urogenital c. trachomatis infections. however, studies of patients with trachoma, the leading
cause of blindness worldwide that is caused by specific ocular c.
trachomatis strains, showed that up-regulated local production
of interleukin-1 and  xxxg2296xxx – a might contribute
to conjunctival damage and scarring in trachoma [8]. murinemodel studies of urogenital c. trachomatis infections showed an
important role for interferon-g in knockout mice [9]. stable variations in the production rates of cytokines between individuals
as well as significant increases within an individual, in response
to infections in general or other proinflammatory stimuli, have
been observed. it is now known that these interindividual differences in cytokine production are associated with polymorphisms
or mutations in regions of cytokine genes that regulate transcription or translation. therefore, further studies are needed on the
genetic properties of c. trachomatis, with emphasis on persistence of infection and on the host genetic background.

evidence for the persistence of cervical c. trachomatis infections, given the high rates of recurrent chlamydial sexually
transmitted diseases that significantly contribute to ectopic pregnancy and infertility. thus, we concentrated on the molecular
properties of the pathogen instead of host genetic susceptibility.
we certainly agree that host factors are likely to play an important role in persistence.

plasmodium falciparum: pfcrt and dhfr mutations
are associated with failure of chloroquine
plus  xxxd1672xxx  prophylaxis in travelers

to the editor—french clinicians still support the combination
of chloroquine and  xxxd1672xxx  for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis
in most of west africa, where falciparum chloroquine resistance
(fcr) remains moderate. recently, a polymorphism in the pfcrt
gene was reported as strongly associated with in vitro fcr in
parasite lines and in natural isolates [1–3]. in vivo studies
demonstrated absolute selection of the pfcrt k76t mutant allele
in therapeutic failure [4]. however, in areas where fcr rates are
high, the pfcrt mutant allele was ubiquitous and thus was not predictive of clinical outcomes in immune patients [5, 6]. as has
been shown previously in many studies, point mutations in plasmodium falciparum dhfr are linked to antifolate resistance.

the aim of the present work was to determine the dhfr and
pfcrt genotypes of isolates obtained from travelers who had
used combination chloroquine- xxxd1672xxx  prophylaxis.
from 1997 to 2000, 62 isolates of p. falciparum were
obtained, at the bichat–claude bernard hospital (paris), from
symptomatic malaria-infected travelers who had correctly taken
chloroquine- xxxd1672xxx  prophylaxis. the countries visited were
categorized into 2 groups, according to the classification adopted
by french experts: group 2 countries are those where the recommended chemoprophylaxis regimen is chloroquine- xxxd1672xxx ,
and group 3 countries are those where the recommended chemoprophylaxis regimen is mefloquine. isolates came from 15 countries in sub-saharan africa, southeast asia, and south america;
1 isolate was from an undetermined african country. twentyeight isolates were from group 2 countries, and 33 were from
group 3 countries. the presence of chloroquine, monodesethylchloroquine,  xxxd1672xxx , and cycloguanil in plasma was determined by high performance liquid chromatography [7]. drugs or
metabolites in plasma were detected for at least 3 of the 4 drugs
or metabolites tested in 48 of the 62 cases. in 14 cases, only
chloroquine and monodesethyl-chloroquine were detected.
dna was extracted from clinical isolates, and dhfr 108, 51,
and 59 and pfcrt 76 genotypes were determined by polymerase
chain reaction followed by dna sequencing (see table 1, published only in the electronic edition of the journal [http://www
.journals.uchicago.edu/jid/home.html]). all isolates had the
pfcrt k76t mutation. sixty-one isolates (98%) presented the
dhfr s108n mutation. fifty isolates (81%) had the triple
dhfr mutation s108n, n51i, c59r. eleven isolates (18%) had
double dhfr mutations, either s108n, n51i (2 isolates) or
s108n, c59r (9 isolates). one isolate had a wild-type dhfr
genotype. there was no significant association between the number of mutations in dhfr and the classification of the country.
there also was no significant association between the number of
mutations in dhfr and drug concentrations in plasma.
the interpretation of the efficacy of a prophylactic regimen
depends on drug compliance and may be controversial. in this
regard, well-conducted interrogations were crucial to validate
the prophylaxis failures included in this series. measurements of
 xxxd1672xxx  and its metabolite cycloguanil were not always useful
because their short half-life limited interpretation of drug ingestion. in particular, most patients who did not show a protective
cycloguanil level in plasma developed malaria .4 weeks after
returning to france and discontinuing prophylaxis. in addition, a
large interindividual variability of drug or metabolite levels in
plasma has often been reported. however, the only patient who
presented an isolate having a dhfr wild-type genotype had no
detectable cycloguanil in plasma.
the mutant allele pfcrt k76t was found in all isolates of this
series. this could reflect a very high frequency of this allele in
countries visited by the patients, but results of previous studies
did not confirm this hypothesis [2–4, 8]. the more likely explanation is a selection of the mutant allele by the chloroquine

included in the prophylactic regimen of patients. these results,
obtained with prophylactic doses given mostly to nonimmune
subjects, confirmed the association of the mutation pfcrt k76t
with chloroquine resistance.
mutations observed in the dhfr gene were dramatically frequent among isolates of the series. all isolates but 1 showed the
s108n mutation, and most had a triple mutation. in a comparable
series of isolates from travelers who had not taken antifolate prophylaxis, the proportion of wild-type (s108) isolates was reported
as near 50% [9]. the rapid selection of dhfr point mutations in
positions 108, 51, and 59 has already been described under antifolate pressure.
among isolates with double mutations in the present series, a
mutant allele was selected more frequently in codon 59 than in
codon 51, as reported by doumbo et al. [10] in a study using prophylaxis by pyrimethamine alone. more than one-half of isolates
in the present series came from group 3 countries, where chloroquine- xxxd1672xxx  prophylaxis is not recommended by french clinicians. authentic prophylaxis failures with this combination
remain rare in group 2 countries. to continue to recommend combination chloroquine- xxxd1672xxx  prophylaxis to travelers, it is
important to regularly monitor the susceptibility of parasites in
areas where fcr is not already extensively present. it may be
stressed that prophylaxis failures in travelers may detect resistance earlier and at weaker levels than treatment failures within
local populations, because the doses used are lower and because
travelers usually are nonimmune subjects.
