acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is a heterogeneous disease with
multiple different cytogenetic and molecular aberrations contributing to leukemic transformation. we compared gene
expression profiles of 4608 genes using cdna-arrays from 20
aml patients (nine with 7/del7q and 11 with normal karyotype)
with 23 cd34 þ preparations from healthy bone marrow donors.
ski, a nuclear oncogene, was highly up regulated. in a second
set of 183 aml patients analyzed with real-time pcr, the
highest expression level of ski in aml with 7/del7q could be
confirmed. as previously described, ski associates with the
 xxxd3417xxx  receptor (rar) complex and can repress transcription. we wanted to investigate the interference of ski with
rara signaling in aml. ski was co-immunoprecipitated and
colocalized with rara. we also found that overexpression of
wild-type ski inhibited the prodifferentiating effects of retinoic
acid in u937 leukemia cells. mutant ski, lacking the n-cor
binding, was no more capable of repressing rara signaling.
the inhibition by wild-type ski could partially be reverted by the
histone deacetylase blocking agent  xxxd3485xxx . in conclusion, ski seems to be involved in the blocking of differentiation
in aml via inhibition of rara signaling.

introduction
acute myeloid leukemia (aml) is a clonal disease arising from
hematopoetic progenitor cells. a key event in the pathogenesis
of aml is the disturbance of transcription factors that control the
normal hematopoetic differentiation.1 as an example, in
patients with acute  xxxg1785xxx  (apl), the function
of the  xxxg1931xxx  (rara) is inhibited by
translocations that replace the amino-terminal transactivation
domain with different repressor proteins.2 the fusion protein
pml–rara interacts with n-cor and recruits the msin3–histone
deacetylase (hdac) complex, decreasing histone acetylation
and producing repressive chromatin organization and transcriptional repression. unlike normal stem cells, cells with this kind
of chimeric receptor do not differentiate in response to
physiological concentrations of  xxxd3417xxx .3 higher doses of
 xxxd3417xxx  lead to dissociation of the n-cor–msin3–hdac

complex and transcriptional activation.4 this molecular mechanism accounts for the block in differentiation in apl.
the apl is characterized by a very good prognosis. in our
study, we were interested in the better molecular understanding
of a clinical homogenous subgroup with a poor prognosis (aml
with monosomy 7 or deletion 7q (7/del7q)).5–8 we analyzed
samples from aml patients with 7/del7q, aml patients with
normal karyotype (without  xxxg801xxx  mutation) and normal bone
marrow stem cells of healthy individuals, by gene expression
profiling. comparison of these three groups showed that the
expression of ski, a nuclear co-repressor of the hdac complex,
is highly upregulated in 7/del7q aml. a further analysis of ski
expression in a larger group of aml patients from different
cytogenetic subgroups by real-time pcr confirmed a high ski
expression in 7/del7q aml and to a lesser degree in other
cytogenetic subgroups.
a functional involvement of ski in different signaling pathways and its transforming activity in hematopoetic cells has
been described.9–11 because dahl et al.12 showed that ski could
be involved in the repression of rar signaling and we found a
lower ski expression in the more differentiated aml subgroups
(e.g. t(15;17)), we decided to further investigate ski and its
interference with the rara signaling pathway in aml.

patients, materials and methods

patients
in total, samples from 201 patients (median age: 60 years; range:
15–87 years; male: n ¼ 95; female: n ¼ 106), treated according
to the aml-96 multicenter protocol of the german süddeutsche
hämoblastose group with a blast count z60%, were
selected.13 diagnosis was based on standard criteria including
clinical, microscopical and facs analysis as described.14 each
patient gave written informed consent to participate in the study.
the local ethics committee of the philipps-university marburg
approved this study.
twenty of the 201 aml samples were selected for microarray
studies. the first subgroup consisted of bone marrow samples
from nine patients (median age: 62 years; range: 20–74 years)
with aberrations of chromosome 7, either monosomy 7 or
deletion of the long arm (del7q). the second group (n ¼ 11; 10
with de novo aml; one with raeb-t; median age: 57 years;
range 36–74 years) was of normal karyotype without  xxxg801xxx 
aberrations.  xxxg801xxx  mutations were assessed as described.14 for
both groups, only aml bone marrow samples with a blast count
x60% were analyzed. the blast count was estimated by
standard microscopy and facs analysis in a central laboratory.
patient characteristics are shown in supplementary table 1.

aml samples for real-time pcr

plasmid constructs

samples from 183 aml patients out of 201 patients were
analyzed by real-time pcr. samples from eight patients out of
20, which were analyzed with microarray technology, were
included in real-time pcr experiments.

t7-tagged expression vectors for wild-type ski (wt-cski) and
ski(l110p) vectors have been described previously.15 the
expression vectors for rara and  xxxg1998xxx  were kindly provided
by dr t heinzel, frankfurt, germany. for expression and
detection in cos-1 cells, human rara (x06614) cdna
fragment was generated by pcr using primers 50 -gcgcggg
aattcgccagcaacagcagc-30 , 50 -gcgcggtcgactcac
ggggagtgggt-30 , digested with ecori/sali, and cloned into
ecori/sali sites of pcmv-tag2b (stratagene, la jolla, ca, usa).
the luciferase construct p(rare)3-tk-luc was kindly provided by
dr cecile egly, strassbourg, france. the b-galactosidase vector
pcmvb and the expression vector pegfp-c1 were purchased
from clontech bd biosciences, germany.

healthy bone marrow specimens
twenty-three patients (mean age: 63 years; range: 46–82 years)
undergoing total hip arthroplasty, due to osteoarthritis or
fracture, were included as control group for array analysis.
neither malignant, chronic inflammatory or systemic diseases
were present. spongy bone tissue was carefully cut into small
pieces, rinsed with saline and filtered. cd34 þ selection of the
bone marrow cell suspension was performed using magnetic
microbeads (miltenyi biotec, bergisch gladbach, germany).
this procedure was repeated once (mean purity was 76%). each
patient gave written informed consent. the ethics committee of
the philipps-university marburg had approved the study.

cell lines
cell lines hl-60, kasumi-1 and u937 were purchased from
atcc and incubated (rpmi1640 þ 10% fetal calf serum
(fcs) þ  xxxd2871xxx  (100 u/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml)).
fcs was used without depletion of  xxxd3417xxx  because
changes in cell differentiation were only seen after addition of
supra-physiological levels of  xxxd3417xxx . u937/pegfp-c1,
u937/c-ski wt and u937/c-ski (l110p) cells were generated as
previously described.15 qt6 (transformed quail fibroblasts16),
was grown in iscoves’ modified dmem (8% fcs, 2% chicken
serum,  xxxd2871xxx  (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml)).

rna extraction
all aml samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis. no
cd34 þ selection was made. patient samples or cell culture
were isolated using rneasy mini kit (qiagen, hilden,
germany). dnase digestion of all samples was performed using
the rnase free dnase-kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). cd34 þ
selected bone marrow cells were extracted using rnazol
(peqlab, erlangen, germany). yield of rna was measured
with ribogreen fluorometry.17

preamplification of rna samples and microarray
experiments (see supplementary information)
real-time pcr analysis.
microarray expression data were validated using real-time pcr
analysis. reverse transcription (rt) of 1 mg total rna was
performed as described previously18 or the omniscript rt-kit
(qiagen, hilden, germany). triple reactions were carried out by
abi prism 7700 (applied biosystems, foster city, usa) using
the detection system quantitect sybr green pcr kit (qiagen)
as outlined by the supplier. the data of real-time quantitative
pcr were evaluated based on the ddct-method. b-actin
(patient samples and cell lines) or pbgd (32d cells) expression
was used as internal reference. primer pairs specific for kras,
ube2d3,  xxxg611xxx ,  xxxg412xxx , vcam, ski, rpa3, gtf2b, bteb1, rfp,
flj21016, sec61g, kiaa0010, polrj2,  xxxg2171xxx  and ywhah
are available upon request. in every assay, ski expression of the
cell line kasumi-1 was used as internal standard.
leukemia

transient transfections and reporter gene assays
qt6 cells were transfected with p(rare)3-tk-luc(1 mg), expression vectors for rara and  xxxg1998xxx  (2 mg), wt-ski or ski(l110p)
(2 mg) and pcmvb(1 mg).19 the total amount of dna was
adjusted with empty vector (pegfp-c1). for ligand stimulation,
cells were treated with 1 mm atra and/or 1 mm  xxxd3485xxx 
(vpa) for 16 h. data were plotted relative to b-galactosidase
activity. results were expressed as means7s.d. from three
independent experiments.
expression plasmids were introduced into cos-1 cells using
fugene 6 (roche applied science).15 cells were transfected
with flag-tagged-rara plus t7-tagged wt-c-ski. t7-tagged
wt-c-ski was co-immunoprecipitated with flag-tagged-rara
using anti-flag antibody or normal igg.

immunoprecipitation and western blot
transiently transfected cos-1 cells were lysed in nonidet p-40
buffer (50 mm tris-hcl (ph 7.5), 150 mm nacl, 5 mm edta,
0.5% nonidet p-40, and 10% glycerol) containing phosphatase
and protease inhibitors. precleared extracts were incubated with
mouse anti-flag (m2, sigma) monoclonal antibody or mouse
normal igg (santa cruz biotechnology). immunocomplexes
were recovered using protein g-sepharose (amersham biosciences), separated on sds-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes ( xxxd2571xxx , schleicher &
schüll). the primary antibodies used for western blot were
anti-t7 and rabbit anti-flag polyclonal antibody (sigma).
proteins of interest were detected using chemiluminescence
(ecl, amersham biosciences).

immunofluorescence
cultured cells and patient samples were spun down on
coverslips by cytospin centrifugation, air-dried and fixed with
methanol (50 at room temperature), and permeabilized with
acetone (20 at 201c).20 cells were processed as described.21
primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal anti-ski (g8, kamiya
biomedical company, seattle, wa, usa) and rabbit polyconal
anti-rara (c-20): sc551 (santa cruz, heidelberg, germany)),
secondary antibodies (donkey-anti-rabbit alexa 488 (invitrogen,
karlsruhe, germany, 1:500) and donkey anti-mouse tetramethylrhodamine-isothiocyanate (tritc) (dianova, hamburg,
germany, 1:100)) were used. for details see supplementary
information.

flow cytometry
cell lines were harvested and washed twice with facs buffer
(pbs þ 5 mg/ml bsa). cells (5  105) were incubated with 10 ml

pe-conjugated anti-human  xxxg1206xxx ,  xxxg1208xxx  or cd34 antibody
(becton dickinson, heidelberg, germany) and analyzed on a
facs-scans. pe histograms were obtained by analyzing
15 000–20 000 cells, gated by scatter characteristics. the
viability was assessed by  xxxd3027xxx  iodide staining (1 mg/ml)
and cell quest software (version 6.3.1; becton dickinson).

nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay
the nitro blue tetrazolium (nbt) reduction assay was carried out
as described.15 u937 cells were treated with solvent (ethanol) or
atra (1 mm). cell viability was 490% (trypan blue exclusion).

statistical analysis
two-sample t-statistics and adjusted p-values were used to
identify differentially expressed genes.22 the adjusted p-values
correct for testing 4608 genes at the same time and estimate the
overall probability of detecting one false gene. differences in
quantifiable ski gene expression or other quantifiable parameters between the analyzed subgroups were evaluated by twotailed mann–whitney u-test or t-test. differences in binary
parameters were evaluated by two-tailed fisher’s exact test.
multivariate analyses of the influence of age, cytogenetics
(good/standard/poor) and ski expression (low/high) on the
probability of relapse or survival were carried out by cox
regression using the spss 11.0 software package (spss, chicago,
il, usa). po0.05 was considered significant.
box and whisker plots were used to graphically display the
differences in the expression level of ski (figure 1a).23

results

gene expression analysis shows ski as upregulated
in 7/del7q aml
a cdna chip consisting of 4.608 genes was used to analyze
expression profiles in 20 aml patients (nine with 7/del7q and
11 with normal karyotype ( xxxg801xxx -negative)) and compared them
with cd34 þ progenitor cells isolated from healthy human
bone marrow (n ¼ 23). in the statistical analysis of gene
expression profiles, we found the oncogenes ski and k-ras2
among other highly differentially regulated genes (supplementary figure 1 and supplementary table 2a–c). we further
analyzed ski, because elevated expression of ski is sufficient to
transform embryonic and hematopoetic cells.10,11
to validate the cdna-microarray analysis, relative gene
expression levels were measured by real-time pcr in a set of 14
genes that were differentially regulated in aml samples. twelve
out of 14 genes, analyzed by rt-pcr, could be confirmed
(supplementary table 3).

ski is upregulated in most cytogenetic subgroups
we determined expression levels of ski in different cytogenetic
subgroups of aml. cytogenetic data were available in 183 out
of 189 cases analyzed by real-time pcr. correlation of ski
expression with the cytogenetic data revealed that ski expression was very high in blasts from 7/del7q aml patients. ski
was also overexpressed in most subgroups of aml compared
with normal cd34 þ stem cells (figure 1a), consistent with the
array data. we observed differences between normal cd34 þ
progenitor cells, and aml with normal karyotype (p ¼ 0.007),
aml with 7/del7q (p ¼ 0.008) and for the group of complex or
other rare karyotypes (p ¼ 0.002)(figure 1b). however, in aml

of the 13 analyzed aml-m3 t(15;17) samples, 11 revealed a
very low expression level comparable to the expression level of

difference between aml with translocations involving cbf and
normal cd34 þ cells (figure 1b).

mutated ski(l110p) partially reverts the effect of ski
in an nbt assay
to test whether ski inhibits rara signaling as previously
described by dahl et al., we used the monoblastic leukemia
cell line u937.12,24 because u937 cells express low levels of
endogenous ski, we infected these cells with recombinant
retroviruses expressing ski, as well as with a blasticidin

resistance gene. addition of atra to control u937 cells led to a
strong increase in cells staining positive with nbt, an indicator
for cellular differentiation (figure 2a and b). retroviral expression of ski led to reduced nbt staining in response to atra
(figure 2a and b). immunophenotypic and morphological
differentiation of transfected u937 cells treated with atra is
shown in supplementary figure 2.
expression of ski(l110p) resulted in a number of nbt-positive
cells, comparable to control cells after atra incubation (figure
2a and b). western blot confirmed equal levels of ski expression
in wild-type and mutant ski in u937 cells (figure 2c).
to test whether repression of rar function by ski required
binding to n-cor, we performed transient transfection experiments in fibroblastic qt6 cells using either wild-type ski or the
point mutant which is unable to interact with n-cor
(skil110p).15 in contrast to wild-type ski, ski(l110p) revealed
only a partial reduction of the atra-induced luciferase activity
(figure 2d).

ski binds to rara and colocalizes in primary aml cells
to investigate a potential interaction of ski and rara in vivo,
we performed a co-immunoprecipitation (co-ip) analysis. cos-1
cells were co-transfected with constructs encoding flagtagged-rara and t7-tagged wt-cski. flag-tagged-rara coprecipitates with t7-tagged wt-cski as shown in figure 3a, lanes
3 þ 6. treatment of cos-1 cells with the ligand  xxxd3417xxx 

does not influence the binding of flag-tagged-rara and
t7-tagged wt-cski (figure 3a, lanes 1–3 vs lanes 4–6).
colocalization of ski and rara could be detected using
immunofluorescence in myeloblastic cell line u937 and in aml
samples, but not in the promyelocytic cell line nb4. as can be
seen in figure 3b, in u937 leukemia cells (e–h), both proteins
were partially colocalizing, which can be seen by yellow
colorization in the nucleus (h). in contrast, in nb4 cells (i–l),
which harbour a t(15;17), ski could not be detected (j). in panel l
(merge) no yellow colorization is present. panels a–d of
figure 3b show the immunofluorescence of a first diagnosis
sample of an aml patient with normal karyotype. colocalization of ski and rara (small speckles) in the nucleus can be
seen. two further patients showed similar results.

the hdac inhibitor, vpa, partially reverts the
repressive effects of ski
n-cor is associated with hdac activity and repression of
transcription in a hdac-dependent manner.25 we used qt6
cells transiently transfected with the reporter gene prare-tkluciferase (under the control of  xxxd3417xxx  response elements)
and vectors encoding for rara and ski and incubated these
cells with either atra and/or vpa as indicated (figure 4a). skimediated repression of atra-induced luciferase activity was
partially antagonized by vpa (figure 4a). in u937 cells
transfected with wt-c-ski or vector, the addition of vpa alone

we found a higher expression of endogenous ski in the more

discussion
ski has transforming activity in chicken hematopoietic cells and
has been implicated in the regulation of different signaling
pathways that control the proliferation and differentiation.10
first, ski is a negative regulator of signal transduction through
tgf-b in vivo.26 second, ski is a cofactor for repression of the
mad family of transcriptional repressors.27 third, ski represses
transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, for example,
rara.12 the divergent functions of ski may be explained by its
ability to bind multiple partners.

we analyzed aml with 7/del7q, using gene expression
profiling, and found an overexpression of ski. the analysis of a
larger group of aml patients by real-time pcr also showed
elevated ski expression levels in other cytogenetic subgroups.
according to the involvement of ski in the rara signaling
pathway, as described by dahl et al.,12 we were interested to
find out whether the overexpression of ski might play a role in
aml. in line with the data of dahl et al.,12 who found a binding
of ski to rara in vitro, we showed the physical interaction of ski
and rara in vivo in cos-1 cells. additionally, we could show
in vitro that the overexpression of ski inhibits transactivation of
rara in the presence of ligand, and that ski and rara are
colocalized in the nucleus of the hematopoetic cell line u937,
as well as in primary aml cells. these data showed that ski
indeed binds to rara and functionally interacts in the nucleus
of hematopoetic and leukemic cells.
in apl, the pml-rara fusion protein causes a strong
dominant-negative effect, resulting in a blockade of rarainduced differentiation.2 the rara signaling pathway, which is
important in myeloid differentiation, might also be partially
inhibited by other binding partners in non-apl amls. our
hypothesis was that ski overexpression interferes with rara
signaling, causing a partial inhibition of differentiation and thus
contributing to the leukemic phenotype. in tumor cells, it is
known that genetic aberrations frequently target alternative
proteins involved in the same critical signaling pathway. for
instance, palmero and peters28 described a comparable
leukemia

phenomenon in human tumors, where mutations that affect
either p16( xxxg421xxx ), cyclin d or the retinoblastoma protein, all
components of the same pathway, occur in a mutually exclusive
manner.
nomura et al.27 could show that ski is a component of the
hdac complex and is involved in the transcriptional repression
by nuclear hormone receptors. the multiple repression domains
of ski interact with different partners of the hdac multiple
protein complex. ski binds to n-cor/smrt and msin3a
through different repression domains, but seems to mediate
transcriptional repression with additional factors.27 previously,
we could show that the function and interaction of ski with

n-cor is signal dependent.15 in contrast to the ski-mediated
repression of the nuclear receptor signaling, repression of tgf-b
signaling was n-cor independent. as demonstrated in figure 2,
our results of co-ip showed a direct interaction of ski and rara,
suggesting that ski exerts its repressive function via the nuclear
receptor pathway. moreover, this repression is n-cor dependent as shown by the reporter gene assay, using the mutant
ski(l110p), lacking the n-cor binding (figure 3). our data
suggest that ski inhibits rara signaling n-cor dependent, as
one partner of the multiprotein complex of hdacs.
n-cor, a binding partner of ski, and smrt have been
implicated in repression of differentiation in acute leukemias. (i)
in apl, the interaction of pml-rara fusion protein with the corepressors was shown to be less sensitive to  xxxd3417xxx  than
interaction with wild-type rara.29 (ii) in aml with t(8;21),
aml-eto interacts with n-cor and represses transcription,
causing an inhibition of differentiation.30,31 (iii) acute leukemias
with translocations involving tel also showed an interference
with the co-repressor n-cor.32 we found that overexpressed
ski inhibits rara signaling in different cytogenetic subgroups of
aml. as described for leukemias (i–iii), where hdac inhibitors
impaired the repression of differentiation, we could show that
the hdac inhibitor vpa partially reverted the effect of
overexpressed ski. thus, the repression of hdac-associated
differentiation seems to be a more common event in acute
leukemias.
to study the clincal relevance of hdac inhibitors, kuendgen
et al.33 and our study group34 investigated the therapy with vpa
and vpa/atra in patients with myeloid diseases. kuendgen
et al.33 reported a response rate of 44% in 18 patients with low/
intermediate mds or secondary aml. bug et al.34 investigated
the combined therapy with vpa and atra. out of 26 patients
with overt aml, only two (8%) achieved an objective response.
these data show that vpa/atra treatment has an in vivo effect
in some patients with myeloid diseases. the involvement of ski
in aml patients treated with vpa/atra has to be analyzed in
additional trials.
in conclusion, ski is involved in rara signaling pathway, and
the repressive function can be antagonized by the hdacinhibitor vpa in cell culture experiments. the overexpression of
ski in certain aml patients might be one step of the multistep
process of leukemogenesis.

figure 4 (a) vpa partially blunts repressive activity of ski in rara
signaling. reporter gene assay showing the ski effect on rara
signaling. qt6 cells were transfected with (rare)3-tk-luc (1 mg),
rara, rxr (2 mg each) plus vector or wt-ski (2 mg) without atra or
vpa (white bars) or in the presence of 1 mm vpa (light grey bars),
1 mm atra (dark grey bars) or a combination of 1 mm vpa and
1 mm atra (black bars) as indicated. reporter gene assays were
carried out 24 h post-transfection. rlu, relative light units
(arbitrary activity). all results are expressed as means7s.d. from
three independent experiments. (b and c) downregulation of
endogenous ski and induction of cell differentiation by treatment
with vpa/atra in vitro. hl60 cells were treated with atra (1 mm)
and/or vpa (1 mm) for 72 h as indicated. (b) facs analysis of the
monocytic/granulocytic differentiation markers  xxxg1206xxx  and  xxxg1208xxx 
upon incubation with the indicated agents. the numbers give the
percentage of cells staining positive for  xxxg1206xxx  (light grey) and
 xxxg1208xxx  (dark grey). (c) real-time pcr analysis documenting ski
expression upon the indicated treatments. expression of b-actin
was used as control. ski expression level of hl60 without
treatment was set to 100%.
