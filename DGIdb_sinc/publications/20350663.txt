rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia
samantha m. jaglowskia and john c. byrdb
rituximab is a class i chimeric anti-cd20 antibody that has shown efficacy in chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (cll), both as a single agent and in combination with traditional chemotherapies. the
modest activity demonstrated in early studies evaluating rituximab in relapsed cll was improved
with higher doses or more dose-intensive regimens that overcame the unfavorable pharmacokinetic
features commonly found in cll. these studies led to a variety of combination trials of rituximab
with chemotherapy, where both phase ii and later phase iii studies have shown great promise for
the advancement of cll therapy. despite the therapeutic success of rituximab in cll, studies
demonstrating the definitive relative mechanism of tumor clearance are still lacking and this requires
further investigation. in addition to being used as a therapy for cll, rituximab is an effective treatment
for autoimmune cll complications such as hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia (itp).
patients with cll may experience early infusion-related side effects that can be diminished with
corticosteroid pretreatment and stepped-up dosing. risk factors for infusion-related toxicity may relate
to atypical cll expressing bright  xxxg1445xxx  expression, although several different studies have not
clearly implicated elevated white blood cell count as a risk factor. other adverse events, including
delayed cytopenias, reactivation of hepatitis b, and development of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, are rare. future efforts focusing on novel combination-based strategies will be required
to fully appreciate the benefit of this therapy in cll.

hronic lymphocytic leukemia (cll)is one of the
most common types of adult leukemia and is
characterized immunophenotypically by expression of the b-cell markers  xxxg375xxx , cd20,  xxxg378xxx , and
cd23, with co-expression of the t-cell marker cd5.
the majority of patients present with asymptomatic
disease, and based on the absence of a survival benefit
with early treatment, they are generally observed until
symptoms of enlarged nodes, organomegaly, or cytopenias develop. genetically, cll has several common
chromosomal aberrations, including del(13q14), trisomy 12, del(11q22.3), and del(17p13.1); the latter
two aberrations are associated with earlier development of symptomatic disease requiring therapy.1 sentinel observations have demonstrated that subtypes of
cll can be biologically distinguished by igvh mutational status.2,3 patients with igvh unmutated disease

often have overexpression of  xxxg2438xxx  and enhanced
b-cell receptor signaling.4 – 6 this subgroup has a higher
frequency of genomic instability and high-risk interphase cytogenetic abnormalities and rapidly progresses
to requiring therapy. in contrast, cll patients with
igvh mutated disease have a more indolent disease
course with extended time from diagnosis to treatment. a role of disordered apoptosis in cll has been
suggested with constitutive activation of several antiapoptotic transcription factors, including nuclear factor-␬b (nf-␬b), nuclear factor of activated t cells
(nfat), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3), that enhance overexpression of
several anti-apoptotic proteins, including bcl-2,  xxxg1388xxx ,
 xxxg2432xxx , and a1.7–9 cll cells also derive significant survival signals from both direct contact with stromal cells
and cytokines (stromal cell– derived factor 1 [ xxxg560xxx ],
cd40-ligand, b-cell–activating factor [baff],  xxxd3054xxx  [il-4], and  xxxg2413xxx 
[vegf]).10
treatment of cll for many years relied on palliative
alkylator-based therapy ( xxxd1665xxx  or cyclophosphamide), which promotes response in 40% to 60% of
patients.11 the nucleoside analog  xxxd2120xxx  was demonstrated to be superior to alkylator-based therapy in
several phase iii studies with respect to overall response rate (orr), complete response (cr) rate, and
progression-free survival (pfs).12–15 subsequent combiseminars in hematology, vol 47, no 2, april 2010, pp 156 –169

nation studies with  xxxd2120xxx  and cyclophosphamide
have demonstrated superior cr rate, orr, and pfs
when compared to  xxxd2120xxx  monotherapy.12,16,17
however, none of these cytotoxic treatment strategies
have attained the high cr rates observed in aggressive
lymphoma and acute leukemia, where cure is appreciated. attaining this goal in cll would require application of therapies with different mechanisms of action.
while the benefit of rituximab is now clearly seen as an
important contributor to improving outcomes in cll
patients, the historical review of development clearly
documents a less promising potential during the early
days of rituximab clinical development.

early development of
rituximab as a single agent in cll
rituximab is a chimeric murine/human antibody directed at the  xxxg1445xxx . cd20 is expressed almost
exclusively on b cells from beyond pre–b-cell stage but
is lost as post-germinal cells differentiate to become
plasma cells. the function of cd20 is germane to b-cell
development as cd20 knock-out mice demonstrate
normal b-cell number and localization with a very
modest phenotype of immature and mature b cells
where igm expression is moderately lower and cd19induced intracellular calcium response is significantly
reduced.18 the  xxxg1445xxx  is neither shed nor internalized in resting b cells, making it an ideal antigen for
targeting with therapeutic antibodies.19 early preclinical studies with rituximab demonstrated this antibody
could mediate both complement-dependent cytotoxicity (cdc) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(adcc) against cd20⫹ tumor targets.20 preclinical primate studies demonstrated depletion of normal b cells
in vivo20 with rituximab, providing sufficient validation
for this antibody to be tested in a phase i study in
cd20⫹ non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl). the initial
phase i dose-escalation study of rituximab demonstrated a dose-dependent and specific depletion of b
cells in patients with relapsed nhl, specifically at
doses greater than 100 mg/m2, and in spite of the fact

that this was a study of a single infusion of rituximab,
some partial responses (prs) and minor responses
were noted.21 the subsequent phase i multidose trial
also demonstrated the rapid depletion of circulating
normal b cells, as well as malignant cells in patients
with relapsed b-cell malignancies.22 patients received 4
weekly doses of 125 mg/m2, 250 mg/m2, or 375 mg/m2
of rituximab; 18 patients received all four doses. three
of nine patients who received 375 mg/mg2 had prs; the
majority of adverse events were infusion-related and all
were reversible.22 an early communication of the subsequent phase ii study reported on 37 patients with
relapsed nhl.23 three of these patients had crs, and
another 14 had prs. in those patients who responded,
the median time to progression was 10.2 months. the
most common adverse event noted was, again, infusion-related toxicity.23 the best responses were observed
in patients with follicular histology, and the phase iii
study of 166 patients was focused on those patients
with low-grade or follicular lymphoma.24 forty-eight
percent of patients had a response, and 6% had a cr. of
the 75 patients who did not meet criteria for a cr or
pr, 56 had a measurable disease response. the projected
median time to progression was 13 months.24 however,
when response was broken down according to international working group criteria, the response among the 33
patients with small lymphocytic lymphoma (sll) was
only 12%.25 similarly disappointing results were obtained
in several other small studies enrolling 10 or fewer sll/
cll patients each.26 –28 studies performed by the german
cll study group (gcllsg) (n ⫽ 28 patients) and nordic
study group (n ⫽ 25 patients) demonstrated orrs of 25%
and 35%, respectively, with short remission duration.29,30
responses in each of these studies were predominately in
the blood and nodal compartment, with little improvement in marrow disease. relapse of disease was generally
noted within 2 to 4 months following completion of
therapy. the results of selected phase ii studies are listed
in table 1.
the very modest response to rituximab as compared
to other types of b-cell lymphomas provided some

158

pause for developing this agent in cll/sll. potential
reasons for lower response in this disease included
diminished cd20 expression on cll cells,31 altered
innate immune function,32,33 and different pharmacokinetic features25 compared to lymphoma, due to the
often large tumor load in the blood. two trials performed by the m.d. anderson cancer center and our
own group administered either higher doses of rituximab weekly (up to 2,250 mg/m2 per dose) or thriceweekly doses to relapsed cll patients and showed
improved response.34 –36 benefit in these two trials was
again seen predominately in the blood and nodal compartment, although response duration approached that
achieved in follicular b-cell nhl in previous trials. unfortunately, no patients with del(17p13.1) responded
to thrice-weekly rituximab, indicating that single-agent
rituximab is ineffective in this high-risk population.37,38
nonetheless, both dose escalation and thrice-weekly
dosing improved response rate, established a role for
single-agent rituximab in relapsed cll, and provided
support for the study of rituximab in combination strategies in previously untreated cll. such studies were
also supported by early investigations demonstrating
sensitization of cd20⫹ tumor cells to the effects of
cytotoxic therapy with rituximab.39
subsequent studies demonstrated that weekly single-agent rituximab at the lower 375 mg/m2 dose had
greater clinical efficacy in previously untreated cll
patients.40 forty-four previously untreated patients
with sll/cll received 4 weekly doses of rituximab at
375 mg/m2; the orr after the first course of rituximab
was 51% (cr 4%). twenty-eight patients with stable or
responsive disease received additional 4-week courses
of rituximab every 6 months for up to four cycles.
however, there was only a modest increase in orr
(58%) and cr rate (9%), and the median pfs of 19
months was shorter than the 36- to 40-month median
pfs obtained by the same investigators using the same
regimen in previously untreated patients with follicle
center b-cell nhl.41 nonetheless, this response duration compared favorably with the response duration to
 xxxd2120xxx  in the upfront setting, suggesting that rituximab is active and may have a role in the upfront
therapy of sll/cll.

early studies examining
mechanism of action of rituximab in cll
therapeutic antibodies such as rituximab can mediate cdc, adcc, and direct apoptosis.42 extensive investigation of each mechanism of action in cll has
been pursued. while cdc is relevant to rituximabmediated cytotoxicity in some b-cell lines, cll cells
express dim cd20 with only a small subset of cells
being susceptible to cdc by rituximab.43,44 very elegant preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that cll cells are prone to cd20 shaving

s.m. jaglowski and j.c. byrd

following treatment, and this diminishes the ability of
cdc to occur. b lymphocytes are rapidly cleared from
the bloodstream following initiation of infusion of rituximab. however, at high blood concentrations of rituximab (⬎100 ␮g/ml), there is a substantial resurgence of b cells. interestingly, these b cells have very
low levels of cd20. rather than being internalized,
rituximab-cd20 complexes are removed from opsonized cells by monocytes in an fc␥ri-mediated process
via the direct exchange of membrane fragments between effector and target cells, resulting in “shaving” of
cd20 from b lymphocytes.45– 48 the transfer of cd20
from lymphocytes to natural killer (nk) cells and
monocytes was again recently demonstrated and presented at the annual meeting of the american society of
hematology (ash).49 attempts to abrogate the phenomenon of shaving have been undertaken clinically
by administering very low doses of rituximab on a
thrice-weekly schedule to subvert the recrudescence of
these b cells with low levels of cd20 with very modest
clinical activity.46,50 thus, while a very strong hypothesis with supportive preclinical data supports shaving
as a reason for modest rituximab clinical activity when
administered at higher doses, it is not clear what cdc
contributes to tumor elimination. monocytes mediate
antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (adcp)51
and nk cells mediate adcc51 against rituximab-labeled
cll cells in vitro. despite this, the function of both
monocytes52,53 and nk cells32,33 to mediate adcp and
adcc respectively are compromised in vivo in cll patients due to increased t-regulatory cells, chemotherapy
administration, and marrow compromise promoted by
active leukemia. whereas single-nucleotide polymorphisms of fc␥riiia and fc␥riia enhance adcc and
response to therapy in other types of lymphoma,54,55 no
added therapeutic benefit has been observed in cll
patients with high affinity fc␥riiia or fc␥riia polymorphisms in two separate studies of rituximab.38,56 collectively, this suggests that adcc may not play a major
role in rituximab clearance of cll cells. finally, our
group and several others have demonstrated that rituximab can mediate both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis in cll through activation of distinct
signaling pathways in vitro.57 in most cases, this requires co-incubation of rituximab with an anti-human
fc-directed antibody.57– 61 type ii anti-cd20 antibodies
such as b1 and the humanized  xxxd2765xxx  antibody promote direct apoptosis without a cross-linking antibody.62 differences between type i (rituximab) and
type ii ( xxxd2765xxx , b1) anti-cd20 antibodies lie predominately in their ability to redistribute cd20 into plasma
membrane lipid rafts.63 type ii anti-cd20 antibodies do
not segregate cd20 into lipid rafts and are very effective at activating a caspase-independent, lysosomal-dependent mechanism of death that is dependent upon
homotypic adhesion.62 the relevance of this observation in vivo among cll patients receiving type ii cd20

rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia

antibody therapy remains unexplored. our group was
the first to note the occurrence of apoptosis with
caspase activation in cll cells in vivo following administration of rituximab.57 this was accompanied by serial
down-modulation of  xxxg1388xxx  in cll cells derived from
patients receiving this therapy.57 these studies, along
with many other pre-clinical studies in lymphoma,39,64
provided justification to move forward with combination treatment strategies proposed below.

phase ii chemoimmunotherapy trials
rituximab has synergistic effects with several chemotherapeutic agents traditionally used for cll and
nhl. two early studies pursued the combination of
 xxxd2120xxx  and rituximab (fr) in cll. the first study
performed by the gcllsg included 31 patients, 20 of
whom were previously untreated and 11 of whom had
relapsed disease.65  xxxd2120xxx  was administered at 25
mg/m2 on days 1–5, 29 –33, 57– 61, and 85– 89, and
rituximab was administered at 375 mg/m2 on days 57,
85, 113, and 151. toxicity included predominately cytopenias and infection. the orr was 87% with 10
(32%) patients achieving a cr. the median duration of
response in this study was 75 weeks.65 a second study
led by the cancer and leukemia group b (calgb) also
examined this combination.66,67 in calgb 9712 patients were randomized to receive sequential  xxxd2120xxx  at 25 mg/m2 on days 1–5 of a 28-day cycle that was
repeated for a total of six cycles followed by 4 weekly
cycles of 375 mg/m2 rituximab given to those patients
with stable disease after 2 months or to receive  xxxd2120xxx  given concurrently with 375 mg/m2 rituximab on
days 1 and 4 of cycle 1 then on day 1 of the subsequent
cycles. this was followed by 4 weekly cycles of rituximab at 375 mg/m2 in those patients with stable disease
after 2 months. patients in the concurrent arm experienced more grade 3 or 4 hematologic toxicity and
infusion-related toxicity, but the orr was 90% with a
cr rate of 47% compared with an orr of 78% and cr
rate of 28% in the sequential arm.66 long-term follow-up data from calgb 9712 were recently presented. remissions appeared quite durable with extended follow-up. there also does not appear to be an
increase in treatment-related myeloid neoplasms or second cancers.68 made possible by similar patient characteristics, the results of calgb 9712 were retrospectively compared to those of calgb 9011, a study
comparing  xxxd2120xxx  and  xxxd1665xxx  as single
agents and their combination.67 only the  xxxd2120xxx 
arm was used in the comparison. multivariate analyses
controlling the pretreatment characteristics demonstrated that patients receiving the fr combination had
significantly better 2-year pfs, with 2-year pfs probabilities of 0.67 versus 0.45 and 2-year overall survival
probabilities of 0.93 versus 0.81.67 a recent third italian
phase ii study of sequential fr confirmed good re-

159

sponse rates, with 78% of patients achieving a cr;
 xxxg2438xxx  –positive and  xxxg384xxx ⫹ patients had significantly
shorter pfs with 25% and 18% at 3 years, respectively.69
the combination of  xxxd2120xxx , cyclophosphamide,
and rituximab (fcr) has been observed to have significant activity in cll. in a single-arm study, 300 previously untreated patients with progressive cll were
given 375 mg/m2 of rituximab on day 1 followed by 25
mg/m2 of  xxxd2120xxx  and 250 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide on days 2, 3, and 4 of the first of six 28-day
cycles.70,71 the rituximab was increased to 500 mg/m2
and the  xxxd2120xxx  and cyclophosphamide were given
on days 1–3 of subsequent cycles. the orr was 95%,
with cr in 72%, nodular partial remission (npr) in 10%,
pr due to cytopenia in 7%, and pr due to residual
disease in 6%.71 two patients (⬍1%) died within 3
months of starting therapy. six-year overall and failurefree survival rates were 77% and 51%, respectively.
median time to progression was 80 months.71 pretreatment characteristics associated with inferior response
in this trial were age (⬎70 years),  xxxg233xxx 
(␤2m) elevated more than twice normal, white blood
cell count greater than 150 x 109/l, abnormal chromosome 17 by standard karyotype, and lactate dehydrogenase greater than twice normal. a multivariate analysis of patients receiving serial  xxxd2120xxx -based
treatments at m.d. anderson cancer center demonstrated that receiving fcr therapy was the strongest
variable associated with improved survival.71 toxicity
in this study included predominately cytopenias and
associated infection. following completion of therapy,
19% patients had persistent cytopenias lasting more
than 3 months. recurrent late cytopenias were also
noted in 28% of patients enrolled on this study. these
cytopenias were predominantly noted during the first
year of remission. the risk of opportunistic infection
was 14% during the first 2 years post-therapy. after this
time period, infections were much less frequent and
typically bacterial in origin. eight patients developed
myelodysplasia with no patient having been exposed to
other cytotoxic therapy. collectively, this study demonstrates the remarkable activity of the fcr regimen as
initial therapy for cll and also suggests long-term toxicity is modest outside of a low frequency of secondary
leukemia.
a second study of 177 previously treated patients at
this same institution was pursued using the same
schedule of fcr.72 the results of this study demonstrated a cr rate of 25% with an orr of 73%.72 the
median time to progression was 28 months, which
varied significantly based on response. specifically, the
median times to progression for patients achieving cr,
npr, and pr were 39, 33, and 15 months, respectively.
toxicities observed in this trial were predominately
grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (81%) and grade 3 or greater
infection (16%). other adverse events were generally
manageable. a retrospective study has recently demon-

160

strated that previously untreated cll patients with the
del(11q22.3) appeared to benefit from fcr with loss of
the adverse pfs observed in  xxxd2120xxx  monotherapy
studies.73 in contrast, patients with igvh unmutated
disease appear to have an inferior outcome with fcr as
compared to patients with igvh mutated disease.74
calgb 10404 is a randomized phase ii study comparing fr, fcr, and fr followed by consolidation therapy with lenalidomide. while both fr and fcr have
been demonstrated to improve cr rate, orr, and pfs,
fcr is potentially more myelosuppressive and immunosuppressive than fr. this study is therefore assigning patients with lower risk cll [those without
del(11q22.3)] who have been shown to benefit from
cyclophosphamide therapy to these three different
therapies. this study is currently ongoing.

phase iii chemoimmunotherapy trials
the large phase ii studies by the m.d. anderson
group described above along with several other small
studies by others prompted confirmatory phase iii
studies. these studies focused on previously untreated
disease (cll8 from the gcllsg)75 and early relapsed
disease (reach trial)76 have recently been presented
and confirm improved response rates and pfs. in cll8,
previously untreated patients were randomized to receive either  xxxd2120xxx  and cyclophosphamide (fc) at
25 mg/m2 and 250 mg/m2, respectively, on days 1–3 of
a 28-cycle for six cycles or fcr with rituximab given at
375 mg/m2 during the first cycle of therapy and 500
mg/m2 on day 1 of the second through sixth courses. at
a median observation time of 25.5 months, the orr for
fcr was 95% versus 88% for fc, and the crr was 52%
compared to 27% in the fc arm.75 an analysis of
genomic subgroups demonstrated particularly poor
outcomes in those patients with del(17p13.1); shorter
overall survival was seen in the fc arm, as was a trend
towards shorter overall survival in the fcr arm in
patients with unmutated igvh.77 this experience was
recently updated with a median observation of 37
months. the median pfs for patients receiving fcr
was 51.8 months versus 32.8 months for patients receiving fc. the orrs were virtually identical after the
longer observation period, and the cr rates were 44%
versus 21.8% for patients receiving fcr and fc, respectively. the greatest benefit was seen in patients with
binet stage a or b disease. in spite of an increased
number of hematologic toxicities including neutropenia, an increased infection rate was not observed in the
fcr arm, and the number of deaths in the fc arm was
greater than that in the fcr arm.78
the reach trial also compared fc to fcr, this time
in relapsed/refractory patients. the dosing schedule in
the fc arm was identical to that of cll8, but the fcr
arm included a dose of 375 mg/m2 rituximab with the
first cycle. median observation time was 25 months.

s.m. jaglowski and j.c. byrd

observed pfs in the fcr arm was 30.6 months compared with 20.6 months in the fc arm. an orr of 70%
for fcr was observed, versus 58% for fc alone, and the
cr rates were 24% versus 13% for fcr and fc, respectively.76 as observed in earlier studies, hematologic
toxicities were the most significant adverse effects in
both studies.
the french collaborative group on cll and wm
(fcgcll/mw) and the groupe ouest-est d’etudes des
leucemies aigues et autres maladies du sang (goelams)
conducted a multicenter french and belgian trial to
evaluate the efficacy of  xxxd2120xxx  and cyclophosphamide in combination with alemtuzumab (fccam) versus fcr. the cll2007fmp is a phase iii study where
178 fit patients under the age of 65 years without the
del(17p) with previously untreated disease were given
oral fc with 40 mg/m2  xxxd2120xxx  on days 1–3 and 250
mg/m2 cyclophosphamide on days 1–3 for six 28-day
cycles in combination with either rituximab at 375
mg/m2 on day 0 of the first cycle then 500 mg/m2 on
day 1 of subsequent cycles, or alemtuzumab 30 mg
subcutaneous on days 1–3 for six cycles. recruitment
to the study was stopped early because of excess mortality in the fccam arm. the orr in the first 100
patients evaluated was 96% in the fcr arm versus 85%
in the fccam arm and the cr rates were 78% and 58%,
respectively.79 based on this study, the use of alemtuzumab in place of rituximab in combination with  xxxd2120xxx  and cyclophosphamide in the frontline setting
has an unfavorable safety profile and does not represent a valid therapeutic option.

alternative phase ii
chemoimmunotherapy
regimens with rituximab
due to both the delayed cytopenias and less optimal
outcome of fcr in elderly cll patients, alternative
dosing strategies have been evaluated. fcr-lite is one
such strategy.80 this regimen was evaluated in previously untreated patients, many of whom were treated
in a community setting. the dose of  xxxd2120xxx  was
decreased to 20 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide was
decreased to 150 mg/m2, both given on days 1 through
3 of a 28-day cycle for six cycles. the dose of rituximab
was increased to 500 mg/m2 every other week, and
maintenance rituximab was given every 3 months until
relapse. the orr and cr rates were 100% and 79%,
respectively, with a median duration of response of
22.3 months.80 sequential administration of fcr has
also been evaluated. in this trial, all patients received
25 mg/m2  xxxd2120xxx  for 5 days every 4 weeks. if there
was no response after three cycles, they went on to
high-dose cyclophosphamide; otherwise, they completed six cycles. four to 6 weeks after completing
 xxxd2120xxx , patients received cyclophosphamide at
3,000 mg/m2 every 3 weeks for three doses. approxi-

rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia

mately 4 weeks after this, patients received a second
consolidation with 375 mg/m2 rituximab weekly for
four doses. the orr was 89% with a cr rate of 61%.
thirty-three percent of patients achieved a molecular
cr. myelosuppression remained the most significant
toxicity, with 26% of patients unable to complete six
courses of therapy due to cytopenias.81
 xxxd2879xxx  is a purine analog that has been suggested to be less myelotoxic than  xxxd2120xxx  while still
active in cll. a study of patients with previously
treated cll82 or other low-grade b cell neoplasms evaluated patients given 4 mg/m2  xxxd2879xxx , 600 mg/m2
cyclophosphamide, and 375 mg/m2 rituximab on day 1
of each of six 21-day cycles (pcr combination), with
rituximab omitted in the first cycle. among cll patients,
the orr was 75% with a cr rate of 25%. the major
toxicities were grade 3/4 infections in 28% of patients
and grade 3/4 myelosuppression in 53%. the pcr combination was evaluated in previously untreated patients
using a dose of  xxxd2879xxx  of 2 mg/m2.83 ninety-one
percent of patients had responses, with a 41% cr rate.
nineteen patients with a cr had less than 1% cd5⫹ and
 xxxg375xxx ⫹ cells in their bone marrow. similar to the study
with fcr, patients with del(11q22.3) had similar pfs
compared with those without this aberration.83 while
individuals over the age of 70 were more likely to
experience treatment delays with this regimen, no significant differences in orr, cr rate, and pfs were
observed, nor was there a significant difference in the
number of cycles administered or grade 3/4 hematologic, infectious, or other toxicities.84
a community-based phase iii study comparing fcr to
pcr in untreated or minimally treated patients randomized patients to receive either 4 mg/m2  xxxd2879xxx  with
600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide and 375 mg/m2 rituximab
on day 1 of six 21-day cycles or 20 mg/m2  xxxd2120xxx 
with 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide and 375 mg/m2 rituximab on day 1 of six 28-day cycles.85 cr rates were 17%
in the fcr group compared with 7% in the pcr group,
and the orr was 57.5% versus 45%, respectively. the cr
rate was significantly different, but orr was not. infection rates were statistically equivalent.85 the reasons for
the extremely low response to both regimens in this
study are uncertain but emphasize the importance of
developing treatment regimens that can be effectively
translated to the practicing community or alternatively
directing cll treatment to centers with significant experience in managing these treatment regimens.
 xxxd298xxx  is a bifunctional agent consisting of a
 xxxd2551xxx  group, a benzimidazole ring, and a
butyric acid side chain. it has been demonstrated in
vitro to induce dna cross-links and strand breaks, as
well as inhibit mitotic checkpoints and induce mitotic
catastrophe. a phase ii study of 67 patients with relapsed indolent nhl and mantle cell lymphoma, including 10 patients with sll, was recently published. patients received 375 mg/m2 rituximab on day 1 followed

161

by 90 mg/m2  xxxd298xxx  on days 2 and 3 every 28
days for four cycles (br combination). additional doses
of rituximab were given 7 days before the first cycle
and 28 days after the last cycle. six cycles were permitted if disease regression was evident between the
second and fourth cycles. orr was 92% with 41% crs,
14% unconfirmed crs, and 38% prs.86 this has been
further evaluated in a phase iii study comparing br
with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (r-chop) as frontline therapy
in patients with follicular, mantle cell, or indolent lymphoma, including sll. the orr was similar between
the groups, but the cr rate was significantly higher for
the br group at 40.1% compared with 30.8% for rchop. the event-free survival was 51 months in the br
group and 31 months with r-chop. br had a more
favorable toxicity profile with significantly fewer grade
3 and 4 neutropenic and leukocytopenic events.87 br
was evaluated as a frontline therapy in patients with
cll in the cll2m study performed by the gcllsg.
 xxxd298xxx  was given to 117 patients at a dose of 90
mg/m2 on days 1 and 2 combined with rituximab at 375
mg/m2 on day 1 of the first cycle and 500 mg/m2 on day
1 of subsequent cycles for 6 cycles. at a median observation time of 15.4 months, an orr of 90.9% was
observed with 32.7% crs, 2.7% nprs, and 55.5% prs.
fifty-six of 63 patients with unmutated igvh had a
response. based on these results, the gcllsg is initiating cll10, a randomized phase iii study comparing
the efficacy of br to fcr.88

double-antibody
chemoimmunotherapy
while this review focuses predominately on rituximab,
other therapeutic antibodies are being developed in cll,
including alemtuzumab and lumiliximab, that have been
combined with chemoimmunotherapy approaches. the
approaches that are most promising are reviewed below.
alemtuzumab is a humanized  xxxg393xxx  antibody that
has demonstrated evidence of clinical activity in both
upfront and relapsed cll, including patents with
del(17p13.1). because this antibody targets an alternative antigen than rituximab, investigators at m.d.
anderson cancer center combined this with their fcr
backbone therapy in previously treated patients with
cll. seventy-eight patients with relapsed cll received
the cfar regimen:  xxxd2120xxx  20 mg/m2 on days 2– 4,
cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 on days 2– 4, rituximab
375 mg/m2 (cycle 1) or 500 mg/m2 (cycles 2– 6) on day
2, and alemtuzumab 30 mg intravenously on days 1, 3,
and 5 every 28 days for up to six cycles.89 patients
received pegfilgrastrim, as well as prophylaxis for
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (pcp) and cytomegalovirus (cmv). grade 3– 4 neutropenia was seen in
89% of patients, and 59% developed grade 3– 4 thrombocytopenia. the incidences of major infections (11%),

162

minor infections (28%), and fever of unknown origin
(36%) were similar to the same institution’s experience
with fcr in the relapsed setting. however, prophylactic valganciclovir was significantly more effective in
preventing cmv reactivation (three of 30 patients,
10%) than was prophylactic valacyclovir (25 of 48 patients, 52%). the orr was 65%, with 24% of patients
achieving cr. median pfs was 27 months for the 19
patients achieving cr, compared to only 10 months for
the 32 patients attaining pr. significantly better results
were observed in patients who were sensitive to their last
 xxxd2120xxx  regimen (orr 74%, cr 36%), compared to
patients refractory to  xxxd2120xxx  (orr 49%, cr 6%).
given these promising results, a follow-up study in previously untreated, high risk patients (␤2m ⬎2x normal) was
initiated.90 this trial enrolled 60 patients, of whom 48
were evaluable for response and follow-up at the time of
the initial report. the orr was 94% and the cr rate was
69%. as compared to fcr, the cfar regimen had more
myelosuppression and cmv reactivation. cfar has been
evaluated in the upfront setting as well. sixty patients
were enrolled on a phase ii study and treated according to
the regimen described above. cr was achieved in 70% of
patients, npr in 3%, pr in 18%, and no response in 7%,
leading to an orr of 92%. patients with unmutated igvh
had an orr of 73%, and those with del(17p) had an orr
of 57%, but the time to progression was significantly
shorter in these groups. infectious complications were
similar to those reported with fcr.91
lumiliximab is a primatized antibody directed at
cd23 that mediates apoptosis against cll cells in vitro
and enhances the cytotoxicity of both  xxxd2120xxx  and
rituximab in xenograft models of cd23⫹ lymphoma.92
a phase i study of monotherapy with lumiliximab was
well tolerated but demonstrated no crs or prs.93 we
therefore pursued a phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of
lumiliximab added to fcr in previously treated cll patients.94 thirty-one patients received either 375 mg/m2
(n ⫽ 3) or 500 mg/m2 (n ⫽ 28) of lumiliximab in combination with fcr as administered by the m.d. anderson
cancer center group for six cycles. the toxicity profile
was similar to that previously reported for fcr in treatment of relapsed cll. the orr was 65%, with 52% of
patients achieving cr, which compares favorably with
the cr rate previously reported for the fcr regimen
alone in relapsed cll. the estimated median pfs for all
responders was 29 months. based on this study, a randomized phase iii trial comparing lumiliximab plus fcr
with fcr alone is underway to define the benefit of this
combination in relapsed cll.

rituximab with corticosteroids
corticosteroids are active in lymphoproliferative
diseases including cll, with preclinical data suggesting they both disrupt stromal cell interaction and in
combination with rituximab induce synergistic apo-

s.m. jaglowski and j.c. byrd

ptosis.64 additionally, higher doses of solumedrol
have been shown to promote responses in patients
with chemotherapy-refractory cll independent of
del(17p13.1).95,96 based on these date, investigators
from the university of california, san diego cll group
have performed several small pilot studies of solumedrol (1 g/m2 on days 1–5) in combination with
rituximab 375 mg/m2 weekly ⫻ 4 in both relapsed97
and previously untreated cll.98 among the 14 relapsed
patients treated with this regimen,97 the orr was 93%
and the cr rate was 36%. median time to progression in
the relapsed patient population was 15 months. this
same regimen in 28 previously untreated patients administered for up to three consecutive treatments was
explored, with an orr of 96% and a 32% cr rate.98
toxicity with this treatment in both the relapsed and
upfront treatment settings was acceptably tolerated
provided aggressive infectious prophylaxis was provided. a retrospective analysis of 37 patients with cll
treated with this regimen at the mayo clinic found an
orr of 78% and a cr rate of 22%.99 responses were
observed in patients with del(17p13.1).96 although
well tolerated, 11 (29%) patients developed severe infectious complications during the first week of therapy.
while this regimen is effective in controlling both
del(17p13.1) cll and disease with bulky lymphadenopathy, it requires significant attention to complications that are commonly observed with corticosteroid
therapy: electrolyte abnormalities, hyperglycemia, infectious complications, psychosis, and myopathy.

maintenance rituximab
the question has arisen as to whether there is a role
for maintenance rituximab. maintenance and consolidation strategies using alemtuzumab have been evaluated by several groups including the calgb and
gcllsg. while there is an improvement in cr and
minimal residual disease (mrd) with consolidation alemtuzumab, this strategy has been fraught with complications, and the gcllsg phase iii study had to be
stopped prematurely when seven of the 11 patients
randomized to alemtuzumab consolidation developed
severe infections.100,101 this was recently reiterated
when the final analysis of calgb 10101 was presented
at ash; five patients in cr after receiving  xxxd2120xxx 
and rituximab who were receiving alemtuzumab consolidation died of infectious complications.102 to date,
no randomized trials have been performed to determine if benefit is derived from maintenance rituximab.
two separate phase ii studies have suggested this approach is feasible. the first study performed by hainsworth and colleagues treated 44 previously untreated
cll patients with 375 mg/m2 rituximab weekly ⫻ 4.40
patients with objective responses or stable disease
went on to receive repeated four dose cycles at
6-month intervals. orrs were better than what had

rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia

been previously reported in relapsed/refractory patients, but the median pfs was only 18.6 months.40 a
second phase ii study of 75 previously untreated patients with cll evaluated the efficacy of rituximab
maintenance following treatment with  xxxd2120xxx  for
six cycles.103 all patients received 4 weekly doses of
375 mg/m2 rituximab following therapy, and then
those who were mrd-positive went on to consolidation
with 4 monthly cycles of 375 mg/m2 rituximab followed
by 12 monthly cycles of 150 mg/m2. mrd-positive patients in cr or pr who received consolidation had a
significantly longer response duration than a subset of
patients who did not receive consolidation (87% v 32%
at 5 years). this study identified that patients with
 xxxg2438xxx  positivity,  xxxg384xxx  overexpression, and igvh unmutated status all had lower likelihoods of improved
outcome with rituximab maintenance.103 the infectious complications seen with consolidation alemtuzumab have not been observed in studies evaluating
consolidation rituximab.

rituximab in the
treatment of richter’s syndrome
richter’s syndrome (rs) is an uncommon complication of cll, and its prognosis is poor. two phase ii
studies have examined the use of riutximab as part of
aggressive salvage regimens used to treat this disease. a
study evaluating fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, liposomal doxorubicin, and dexamethasone
plus rituximab and granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (gm-csf) alternating with methotrexate and  xxxd1790xxx  plus rituximab and gm-csf did
not produce better results than an earlier study evaluating hyper-cvad alone, with an overall survival rate of
38% and a 12-month failure-free survival rate of 27%.104
a phase i-ii trial of oxaliplatin,  xxxd2120xxx ,  xxxd1790xxx ,
and rituximab (ofar) was conducted in patients with
rs or  xxxd2120xxx -refractory disease. patients were
given increasing doses of oxaliplatin on days 1– 4 with
 xxxd2120xxx  30 mg/m2 on days 2 and 3,  xxxd1790xxx  1
g/m2 on days 2 and 3, and rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day
3 of cycle 1 and day 1 on subsequent cycles. the
highest tested and tolerated dose of oxaliplatin was 25
mg/m2. the orr was 50% in rs and 33% in fludarabinerefractory cll, and responses were seen in seven of 20
patients with del(17p13.1); median duration was 10
months.105 in an attempt to enhance the response rate
while decreasing myelosuppression, a follow-up study
was conducted where the dose of  xxxd1790xxx  was decreased to 500 mg/m2 and oxaliplatin was increased to
30 mg/m2.  xxxd2120xxx  and  xxxd1790xxx  were given on
days 2– 4 in dose level 2, which was the maximal
tolerated dose. preliminary results indicated an orr of
63%. six of 13 patients with del(17p13.1) responded.106
while these studies suggest rituximab can be effec-

163

tively added to regimens commonly used to treat rs, it
is unclear if this adds any benefit.

rituximab in the treatment
of autoimmune complications
autoimmune complications of cll are well recognized and are reported in about 10% to 25% of patients
during their disease course. these complications are
both an intrinsic characteristic of cll and potentiated
by its therapy, mainly  xxxd2120xxx . autoimmune hemolytic anemia (aiha) is the most common complication,
followed by immune thrombocytopenia (itp).107 rituximab was initially described for the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory pure red blood cell aplasia or
aiha108; subsequently, the successful treatment of two
patients with cll who developed red blood cell aplasia
with 375 mg/m2 rituximab weekly for 2 weeks was
described.109 several case reports of patients with aiha
who have been successfully treated with rituximab
have been reported.110 –112 a series of eight patients
with cll and corticosteroid-refractory aiha was
treated with a combination of rituximab and dexamethasone, and all patients achieved a remission of their
aiha, with five patients achieving a coombs-negative
status. re-treatment was also found to be successful.113
in a series of 14 patients with cll and aiha treated
with rituximab monotherapy, all but two patients had
an increase in their hemoglobin levels after treatment.114 rituximab is effective in patients with chronic
refractory itp as well. twenty-five patients with itp,
including eight who had failed splenectomy, were
treated with rituximab at 375 mg/m2 weekly ⫻ 4, and
52% of patients responded; five had a cr.115 rituximab
has been evaluated in cll specifically, as fludarabinerelated itp is not responsive to corticosteroids. in a
small series of patients, it was shown to be helpful in
quickly reversing  xxxd2120xxx -associated itp.116 while
randomized data demonstrating the exact benefit of
rituximab in autoimmune complications is lacking,
these data provide evidence for the effectiveness of this
treatment. there is no data at present to suggest that
the use of rituximab in combination regimens has reduced the incidence of autoimmune cytopenias in cll,
particularly those that occur with  xxxd2120xxx . in the
authors’ opinion, rituximab represents one of the more
active therapies for the treatment of autoimmune complications of cll not responding to initial corticosteroid treatment.

complications of rituximab therapy
rituximab is generally safe and well tolerated, but it
has been associated with significant adverse events. in
the phase ii studies, it was commonly associated with
fever, chills, rigors, and rarely bronchospasm, all of
which tended to be self-limited and confined to the first

164

one or two doses of treatment.23 while early studies
suggested high blood tumor load may be predictive of
infusion toxicity, subsequent studies have shown no
relationship to this in cll. this suggests that physicians
administering rituximab to cll patients must consider
every cll patient at risk for this toxicity and monitor
closely. in this author’s opinion, the frequency of serious infusion toxicity with rituximab can be greatly
diminished by administration of dexamethasone (20
mg) prior to the first dose of rituximab and by splitting
the first dose over 2 days. fatal reactivation of hepatitis
b (hbv) after rituximab has been described in a small
subset of cll patients receiving this treatment.117–122
because of this complication, screening for evidence of
hepatitis b and c prior to treatment is recommended.
for patients with past exposure to hepatitis b, close
monitoring during and after therapy should be performed, as well as consideration of prophylaxis against
re-activation. organizing pneumonia and interstitial
pneumonitis have been reported with rituximab, both
alone and in combination with chemotherapy.123–125
recently, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) following rituximab use have been described; pml has a case-fatality rate of 90%, although it
is extremely rare.126 –129

new directions and
combination strategies with rituximab
while rituximab has generated significant promise
for the treatment of cll when incorporated into combination-based regimens, its effect as a monotherapy is
somewhat limited. as such, investigators have explored a variety of strategies to enhance the mechanisms of killing that rituximab uses to eliminate cll
cells. to enhance complement-mediated killing, investigators have altered the schedule and dose of administration to diminish the influence of cd20 shaving on
cll cells.46,50 in addition, investigators have infused
fresh frozen plasma to replete complement and enhance the efficacy of rituximab.130,131 relative to adcc,
administration of therapeutics that enhance adcc (lenalidomide132,133, il-21134) or adcp (cpg oligonucleotides,  xxxg2291xxx  angonists) has been pursued preclinically
and, in some cases, in early phase i clinical trials in
combination with rituximab. in this regard, il-21 represents one of the most promising therapeutics51 as it
both enhances autologous nk cell adcc and promotes
apoptosis through a bcl-2–interacting mediator of cell
death (bim)-dependent pathway in cll cells. in contrast, other therapeutic agents such as lenalidomide
that activate both cll cells and the innate immune
system under certain conditions can downregulate
cd20 and antagonize both rituximab adcc and direct
apoptosis with cross-linking.133 nonetheless, this activation-induced cd20 internalization promoted by lenalidomide might offer the opportunity to effectively de-

s.m. jaglowski and j.c. byrd

liver rna-based therapy to cll cells, as our group has
previously demonstrated. these collective noninclusive examples of future strategies to combine rituximab
with other therapeutics exemplifies the significant
amount of work that remains in order to fully appreciate the complete potential of rituximab in cll therapy
more than a decade after its approval for this disease.

conclusion
the chimeric antibody rituximab binds to cd20 and
effectively mediates cdc, adcc, and direct apoptosis
in some settings. the contribution of each of these
mechanisms to rituximab tumor clearance in cll remains unknown and requires further study. rituximab,
when administered in its optimal schedule, has demonstrated monotherapy activity in both untreated and
previously treated cll. rituximab’s greatest contribution to cll therapy is in combination, both in symptomatic, previously untreated cll patients and in those
with relapsed disease. in both of these settings, phase
iii studies have demonstrated improved orr, cr rate
and pfs as compared to chemotherapy alone. rituximab also represents a very helpful therapy in managing autoimmune complications of this disease. to this
point, insufficient data exist to recommend maintenance rituximab in cll and this should not be considered out of the context of a clinical trial.
