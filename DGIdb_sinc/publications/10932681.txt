drugs to treat obesity can be divided into three groups: those which reduce food intake, those
which alter metabolism and those which increase thermogenesis. monoamines acting on
noradrenergic receptors, serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors and histamine receptors can
reduce food intake. a number of peptides also affect food intake. the noradrenergic drugs
phentermine, diethylpropion,  xxxd2546xxx   xxxd311xxx  and phendimetrazine are approved only
for short-term use. sibutramine, a norepinephrine–serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, is approved
for long-term use. orlistat inhibits  xxxg1789xxx  and can block 30% of triglyceride hydrolysis
in subjects eating a 30% fat diet. the only thermogenic drug combination that has been tested
is ephedrine and caffeine, but this treatment has not been approved by regulating agencies.
leptin is currently in clinical trials and other drugs that may modulate peptide-feeding systems
are being developed.
key words: sibutramine; orlistat; ephedrine; thermogenic; monoamine; peptides.

drug treatment for obesity has been tarnished by a number of disasters. beginning in
1893, almost any drug treatment that has been used in obese patients has generated
undesirable outcomes resulting in their termination. table 1 is an historical presentation of drug treatments for obesity and the disasters that befell them.
an additional serious negative impact on the use of drug treatment for obesity is the
negative halo spread by the addictive properties of amphetamine. amphetamine, or
alpha-methyl- xxxd2901xxx , is an addictive  xxxd2901xxx  that reduces food
intake. the addictiveness of amphetamine is probably related to its effects on dopaminergic neurotransmission. its anorectic effects, on the other hand, probably result from
its modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission. because this  xxxd2901xxx 
was addictive, other  xxxd2901xxx  derivatives were also presumed to be addictive;
whether actually addictive or not, they were guilty by association. this has led to
table 1. disasters with drug treatments for obesity.

restrictions on the use of this entire class of drugs by the us drug enforcement
agency.
drugs such as phentermine, diethylpropion, fenﬂuramine sibutramine and the antidepressant venlafaxine are all beta-phenethylamines. phentermine and diethylpropion are
sympathomimetic amines like amphetamine but differ from amphetamine in having little
or no effect on dopamine release at the synapse. the abuse of either phentermine or
diethylpropion is rare. fenﬂuramine, on the other hand, has no effect on the re-uptake
or release of either norepinephrine or dopamine in the brain, but increases serotonin
release and partially inhibits serotonin re-uptake. sibutramine and venlafaxine block the
re-uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine (ne) and, to a lesser extent, dopamine.
thus, derivatives of  xxxd2901xxx  have a wide range of pharmacological effects.
however, if examined uncritically, they could all be lumped with amphetamine and
carry its negative halo. it is thus misleading to use ‘amphetamine-like’ will reference to
appetite-suppressant  xxxd2901xxx  drugs, except for amphetamine and methamphetamine, because of the negative linguistic images.
another issue in the drug treatment of obesity is the perception that, because
patients regain weight when the drugs are stopped, the drugs are ineffective. quite the
contrary is true. overweight is a chronic disease that has many causes. cure, however,
is rare, and treatment is thus aimed at palliation. as clinicians, we do not expect to
cure such diseases as hypertension or hypercholesterolaemia with medications.
instead, we expect to palliate them. when the medications for any of these diseases
are discontinued, we expect the disease to recur. this means that medications only
work when used. the same arguments apply to medications used to treat overweight:
it is a chronic incurable disease for which drugs only work when they are used.
recent reports of valvular heart disease associated with the use of fenﬂuramine,
dexfenﬂuramine and phentermine have provided the most recent problem for the drug
treatment of obesity. this is an example of the ‘law of unintended consequences’. the
report of valvulopathy in up to 35% of patients treated with the combination of
fenﬂuramine and phentermine was totally unexpected. the ﬁnding, however, will add
caution to use of any future drugs marketed to treat obesity and will provide support
for those who believe that the drug treatment of obesity is inappropriate.
mechanisms for drug effects in treatment of obesity
corpulence results from an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure.
this relationship can be viewed in terms of a nutrient balance feedback model. the
targets in this model where drugs might be used are shown in figure 1. this nutrient
balance feedback model provides the framework for this approach to drug treatment.
drugs can reduce food intake, alter metabolism and/or increase energy expenditure;
this will be used in discussing the available and potential drug leads for the treatment
of obesity.
reduction of food intake
noradrenergic receptors
a number of monoamines and neuropeptides are known to modulate food intake.
both noradrenergic receptors and serotonergic receptors have served as the site for
clinically useful drugs to decrease food intake (table 2).1–4 activation of the alpha1- and beta2-

adrenoceptors decreases food intake. stimulation of the  xxxg831xxx -adrenoceptor in experimental animals, on the other hand, increases food intake. direct agonists and drugs
that release ne or block ne re-uptake can activate one or more of these receptors
depending on where the ne is released. phenylpropanolamine is an alpha1-agonist that
decreases food intake by acting on alpha1-adrenergic receptors in the paraventricular
nucleus. the weight gain seen in patients treated with alpha1-adrenergic antagonists for
hypertension or prostatic hypertrophy indicates that the alpha1-adrenoceptor is clinically
important in the regulation of body weight. stimulation of the  xxxg92xxx  by ne
or agonists such an terbutaline, clenbuterol and salbutamol reduces food intake. the
weight gain in patients treated with some adrenergic antagonists, for example
propranolol, also indicates that this is a clinically important receptor in the regulation
of body weight.
serotonergic receptors
the serotonin receptor system, which consists of seven families of receptor, is also
involved in modulating food intake. the stimulation of receptors in the 5-ht1 and
5-ht2 families has major effects on feeding. activation of the  xxxg1108xxx 

134

g. a. bray

increases food intake, but this acute effect is rapidly down regulated and is not clinically
signiﬁcant in the regulation of body weight. activation of the 5-ht2c and possibly
 xxxg1109xxx  decreases food intake. direct agonists (quipazine) or drugs that block
serotonin re-uptake reduce food intake by acting on these receptors or by providing
the serotonin that modulates these receptors.
altered metabolism
excess fat is the visible sign of obesity. metabolic treatment strategies have been
directed to pre- and post-absorptive mechanisms. pre-absorptive mechanisms that
inﬂuence the digestion and absorption of macronutrients have been utilized to develop
orlistat, which inhibits the intestinal digestion of fat and lowers body weight. another
strategy is to affect intermediary metabolism. enhancing lipolysis, inhibiting lipogenesis
and affecting fat distribution between subcutaneous and visceral sites are strategies
that can be developed.
increased energy expenditure
increased energy expenditure through exercise would be an ideal approach to treating obesity. drugs that have the same physiological consequences as exercise would
provide useful ways of treating obesity.
drugs that reduce food intake
table 3 summarises data on a number of drugs used to treat obesity. they are
discussed individually in more detail below.
noradrenergic drugs approved for short-term use in treating obesity
pharmacology
the noradrenergic sympathomimetic drugs are grouped together because they can
increase blood pressure and in part act like the neurotransmitter ne. drugs in this group
work by a variety of mechanisms, including the release of ne from synaptic granules
( xxxd311xxx , phendimetrazine, phentermine and diethylpropion), the blockade of ne
re-uptake ( xxxd2546xxx ), or direct action on adrenoceptors (phenylpropanolamine).
all of these drugs are absorbed orally and reach peak blood concentrations within
a short time. the half-life in blood is short for all except sibutramine and its
metabolites, which have a long half-life. both metabolites of sibutramine are active, but
this is not true of the other drugs in this group. liver metabolism inactivates a large
fraction of these drugs before excretion. side-effects include dry mouth, constipation
and insomnia. food intake is suppressed either by delaying the onset of a meal or by
producing early satiety. sibutramine and  xxxd2546xxx  have both been shown to increase
thermogenesis in experimental animals, but the clinical data are contradictory.
efﬁcacy
the efﬁcacy of an appetite-suppressing drug can be established by showing that, in
double-blind randomized clinical trials, it produces a signiﬁcantly greater weight loss

than a placebo2 and that the weight loss is more than 5% below base-line weight.
clinical trials of noradrenorgic drugs performed before 1975 were generally short
term because it was widely believed that short-term treatment would cure obesity.4
this was unfounded optimism, but because the trials were of short duration, and often
crossover in design, they provided few long-term data. this discussion focuses on
longer-term trials lasting over 24 weeks and on those trials in which there is an
adequate control group.5
phentermine and diethylpropion. a 36-week trial comparing the continuous administration of phentermine with intermittent phentermine and placebo is shown in
figure 2.6 both continuous and intermittent phentermine therapy produced more
weight loss than did the placebo. in the drug-free periods, weight loss slowed the
intermittently treated patients, only for then patients lose weight more rapidly when
the drug was registated. a small trial with diethylpropion showed a greater weight loss
than with placebo. phentermine and diethylpropion are schedule intravenous drugs a
regulatory classiﬁcation indicating the potential for abuse, although the potential
appears to be very low. phentermine and diethylpropion are only approved for a few
weeks, which is widely interpreted as being up to 12 weeks. weight loss with
phentermine and diethylpropion persists for the duration of treatment, suggesting that
tolerance does not develop to these drugs. if tolerance does develop, the drugs would
be expected to lose their effectiveness or patients would require increased amounts
of drug to maintain their weight loss. this does not seem to occur.

enzi et al7 studied 102 patients taking  xxxd2546xxx  2 mg per day and 102 patients receiving placebo in a 15-week trial using a crossover design with an additional 12 months
of treatment with  xxxd2546xxx . there was no signiﬁcant difference between the drug and
placebo conditions during the 15-week trial, but  xxxd2546xxx  gave signiﬁcantly more
weight loss during the long-term 15-month period of treatment.

drug treatment of obesity

137

in a 12-month open-label study of  xxxd2546xxx  in japan, inoue enrolled 32 subjects, half
of whom dropped out prior to 1 year of treatment.8 using last observation carried
forward analysis, there was a 9% loss of initial body weight, which is comparable to the
drug-induced weight loss seen in many placebo-controlled trials with other drugs.
blood pressure and glucose, insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride and glutamic pyruvic
transaminase ( xxxg941xxx ) (gpt (alt)) levels declined during treatment.
phenylpropanolamine. phenylpropanolamine is an  xxxg832xxx -adrenergic agonist of the
propanolamine group. it is an over-the-counter preparation with a provisional us food
and drug administration (fda) approval for weight loss. in reviews by weintraub9 and
greenway10 including published and unpublished studies obtained from the manufacturer, 1439 subjects took active medication and 1086 placebo. at the end of the
studies, which were up to 12 weeks in length and performed before 1985, subjects on
phenylpropanolamine lost about 0.27 kg per week more than did subjects on placebo.
there is only one controlled trial of phenylpropanolamine that lasted 20 weeks. in
this double-blind placebo-controlled trial, 101 subjects were treated with placebo or
phenylpropanolamine for 6 weeks with an optional double-blind extension to week
20.11 at 6 weeks, the phenylpropanolamine-treated group had lost 2.4 kg (0.43 kg per
week) compared to wire 1.1 kg (0.18 kg per week) for the placebo group. in the
optional extension, 24 subjects on phenylpropanolamine lost 5.1 kg (6.5%) compared
with 12 subjects treated with placebo, who lost 0.4 kg per week (0.5%) of their initial
body weight (p <0.05).
serotonin–norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors
sibutramine
in experimental animals, the inhibition of food intake by sibutramine is duplicated by
combining a noradrenergic re-uptake inhibitor (nisoxetine) with a serotonin re-uptake
inhibitor (ﬂuoxetine).12 sibutramine produces the behavioural consequence of satiety.13
sibutramine does not bind to any one of the wide variety of receptors on which it has
been tested. in addition to the inhibition of food intake14, sibutramine also stimulates
thermogenesis in experimental animals15 and human but, as noted above, the human
data are contradictory.16,17
both short-term18–21 and long-term22–25 clinical trials have been reported with
sibutramine. in an 8-week trial comparing placebo with 5 and 20 mg per day
sibutramine, weintraub et al26 noted a weight loss of 1.4 ± 2.1 kg in the placebo group,
2.9 ± 2.3 kg in the group treated with 5 mg per day and 5.0 ± 2.7 kg in the group
treated with 20 mg per day.
in a multicenter dose-ranging trial25, sibutramine produced a dose-related weight
loss lasting up to 6 months (figure 3). a total of 1043 patients were randomized to
receive placebo or 1, 5, 10, 15, 20 or 30 mg per day sibutramine. there was a clear
dose–response relationship, the placebo group losing 1% and the 30 mg per day group
9.5% of their initial body weight. by the end of the 6 months, patients receiving the
lower doses had plateaued in their weight loss, but the 15, 20 and 30 mg per day dose
groups were still losing weight.
in a 1-year trial comparing placebo with sibutramine 10 and 15 mg per day, there
was a signiﬁcantly greater weight loss in the 10 and 15 mg per day group than in the
placebo-treated group.22 in a 1-year trial in which patients were randomly assigned to

over the 24 weeks of the trial.25

sibutramine or placebo after an initial weight loss using a very low-energy diet (vled),
the sibutramine-treated patients continued to lose weight whereas the placebotreated patients regained some weight.27
the initial weight loss in patients treated with sibutramine predicts the long-term
response. of those losing over 2 kg in 4 weeks, only 20% of those on placebo versus
49% of those on sibutramine lost more than 10% of their initial body weight in 12
months.24 weight loss with sibutramine or placebo produces a graded decrease in
triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol.
safety
the side-effect proﬁle for the noradrenergic/sympathomimetic drugs is similar. they
produce insomnia, dry mouth, asthenia and constipation. the safety of older
sympathomimetic appetite-suppressant drugs has been the subject of considerable
controversy because dextroamphetamine is addictive. the sympathomimetic drugs
phentermine, diethylpropion and  xxxd2546xxx  have very little abuse potential, as assessed
by the low rate of reinforcement when the drugs are available intravenously to test
animals. in this same paradigm, neither phenylpropanolamine nor fenﬂuramine showed
any reinforcing effects, and no clinical data show any abuse potential for either of these
drugs.28 similarly, sibutramine has no abuse potential in this paradigm, but it is nonetheless a schedule intravenous drug.
sympathomimetic drugs can affect blood pressure. phenylpropanolamine is an alpha1agonist and, at doses of 75 mg or more, can increase blood pressure. phenylpropanolamine has been associated with stroke and should not be used above doses
of 75 mg per day. phenylpropanolamine has also been reported in association with
cardiomyopathy. in the placebo-controlled studies, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure increased by 1–3 mmhg and the pulse increased by approximately 4–5 beats
per minute. caution should be used when combining sibutramine with other drugs

drug treatment of obesity

139

that may increase blood pressure. sibutramine should not be used in patients with a
history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia or
stroke. there should be a 2-week interval between the termination of monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (maois) and beginning sibutramine, and it should not be used with
maois or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (ssris). because sibutramine is
metabolized by the cytochrome p450 enzyme system (isozyme cyp3a4), it may
interfere with the metabolism of erythromycin and ketoconazole.
peptides that reduce food intake and may be in the early stages of
drug development
leptin
leptin is a peptide produced exclusively in adipose tissue. the absence of leptin
produces massive obesity in mice (ob/ob) and humans.29 treatment with the peptide
decreases food intake in the ob/ob mouse. the diabetes mouse (db/db) and the fatty rat,
which have genetic defects in the  xxxg1320xxx , are also obese, but they do not
respond to leptin. leptin levels in the blood are highly correlated with body fat levels,
yet obesity persists, suggesting that there may be leptin resistance. clinical trials are
currently underway with leptin to see whether it can reduce food intake and body fat
in overweight or diabetic humans. the preliminary data show that high doses of leptin
given peripherally can reduce body weight.
neuropeptides y
 xxxg1590xxx  (npy) is one of the most potent stimulators of food intake and
appears to act through y-5 receptors, although y-1 receptors may also transmit the
feeding effect of npy. antagonists to these receptors might block npy and thus
decrease feeding. pre-clinical trials are underway, and clinical trials are expected soon.
cholecystokinin
cholecystokinin (cck) reduces food intake in humans and experimental animals. this
effect does not require an intact hypothalamic feeding control system but does appear
to need an intact vagus nerve. peptide analogues have been developed and tested
experimentally, but clinical data have not yet been published. a second strategy to
modify cck activity is to reduce the degradation of cck. this approach is similarly
under evaluation.
pancreatic hormones
glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1. pancreatic glucagon produces a dose-related
decrease in food intake. a fragment of glucagon (amino acids 6–29) called glucagonlike peptide-1 (glp-1) reduced food intake when given either peripherally in humans30
or into the brain experimental animals.
amylin. amylin is a pancreatic peptide released from the islet beta-cell along with
insulin. it, too, has been shown to decrease food intake and body weight in animals. in
clinical trials, it lowers glucose, and it has been used with success in type i diabetes.
clinical trials on weight loss are awaited.

drugs that alter metabolism
pre-absorptive agents
orlistat
orlistat is a potent inhibitor of most, if not, all mammalian lipases.31,32 during shortterm treatment with orlistat, faecal fat loss rises during the days of treatment and then
returns to control levels after the medication is discontinued, as would be expected
from an inhibitor of intestinal lipase.33–35 with volunteers eating a 30% fat diet, there
is a dose-related increase in faecal fat loss, which increases rapidly with doses of up to
200 mg per day and then reaches a plateau with doses above 400–600 mg per day.
because of its lipid solubility, less than 1% of an oral dose is absorbed, being degraded
into two major metabolites.36 pharmacodynamic studies suggest that orlistat does not
affect the pharmacokinetic properties of dioxin37, phenytoin37, warfarin38, glyburide38,
oral contraceptives39 or alcohol.31 orlistat also did not affect a single dose of four
different anti-hypertensive drugs:  xxxd2167xxx , captopril, nifedipine37, and atenolol.40 the
absorption of vitamins a and e and beta-carotene may be slightly reduced45, and this may
require vitamin therapy in a small number of patients.
several double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials lasting 1 and 2 years
have been conducted and the data published in papers or in abstract form. the design
of the trials lasting 2 years followed two formats. they all included a 4–5-week singleblind run-in period, after which subjects were stratiﬁed into those losing >2 kg or
<2 kg. orlistat was given at a dose of 60 or 120 mg before each of three meals. the
diet contained 30% fat and, during the ﬁrst year, was designed to produce a mild
hypocaloric deﬁcit of 500–600 kcal per day. during the second year, patients were
placed on a eucaloric diet to evaluate the effect of orlistat on weight maintenance.
weight loss at 1 year varied from 5.5 to 6.6% of initial body weight in the placebo
group and 8.5 to 10.2% in the orlistat-treated group. during the second year, patients
were kept on the same drug regimen as in the ﬁrst year in two trials41, while in the
other two trials42,43, patients were re-randomized to placebo or active drug in a
crossover design. the percentage of patients losing over 5% of body-weight ranged
from 23% to 49.2% in the placebo-treated group and 49% to 68.5% in those treated
with orlistat. using a criterion of above 10% weight loss, 17.7–25% of placebo-treated
patients reached this goal compared with the more successful 38.8–43% seen in those
treated with orlistat. nearly two-thirds of the enrolled patients completed year 1.
data on the second year of treatment are available from three studies. in one
study41, subjects remained on the same treatment for 2 years. at the end of the second
year, weight loss from base-line was –7.6 ± 7.0% for those on orlistat compared with
–4.5 ± 7.6% in the placebo group. at 1 year, the corresponding losses were –9.7 ± 6.3%
and –6.6 ± 6.8%. in the two other studies, the orlistat subjects were re-randomized at
the end of years to placebo or orlistat 60 or 120 mg three times a day.42,43 one of
these studies is shown in figure 4.42 those remaining on orlistat for 2 years regained
32.5% from the end of year 1 to the end of year 2 but were still 8.8 ± 7.6% below baseline. the patients who continued on orlistat with the maintenance diet regained half as
much (2.5 kg, or 2.6%) as did those switched from orlistat to placebo (5.7 kg, or a 5.2%
regain). in this trial, subjects who received orlistat in the second year and placebo in
the ﬁrst lost an average of 0.9 kg more. these data show that initial weight loss is
greater and that weight regain is slowed by orlistat. the 2-year us prevention of
weight regain study treated patients, who had lost more than 8% of their initial weight

by dieting, with orlistat 30, 60 or 120 mg three times a day.45 at the end of 1 year, the
placebo-treated group had regained 56% of the weight they had lost, in contrast with
a regain of 32.4% in the group treated with orlistat 120 mg three times a day.
orlistat improves some serum lipid values more than can be explained with weight
reduction alone.42,44,46 in a multicentre trial, tonstad et al44 compared orlistat at
30–360 mg per day with placebo on a weight-maintaining diet in an 8-week doubleblind, randomized trial. total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterols were reduced 4–11%
and 5–10% respectively in the orlistat groups compared with placebo.44 this reduction
is probably related to the faecal fat loss induced by the drug, and this loss may necessitate supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins during treatment. during the weight loss
period, there was a decline in total cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol, hdl-cholesterol,
fasting glucose level and blood pressure. reitsma et al41 reported that postprandial
lipaemia was reduced. orlistat appears to reduce cholesterol, but not glucose or blood
pressure, by more than can be accounted for by the decrease in body weight.
in a 1-year trial in diabetics47, the orlistat-treated patients lost 6.2% and the placebotreated patients 4.3% of their initial weight. there was also a reduction in the need for
hypoglycaemic medication.
the side-effects of orlistat are to be expected from its mechanism of action on
 xxxg1789xxx .48,49 these include intestinal borborygmi, ﬂatus and abdominal cramps.
the most troubling were faecal incontinence, oily spotting and ﬂatus with discharge.
in a comparison of pooled data on 1740 placebo-treated and 2038 orlistat-treated
patients, orlistat appeared to be well tolerated, the principal complaints being being
gastrointestinal symptoms. most were mild and occurred within the ﬁrst few weeks.48
more placebo-treated patients (35%) withdraw prematurely than did orlistat-treated
patients (29%). there was no evidence for gallstones, renal stones or cardiovascular
or central nervous system events. orlistat has been approved in europe, but has been

delayed in the usa because nine cases of breast neoplasm occurred in patients receiving orlistat as opposed to one in the placebo group. most were detected in the ﬁrst 6
months and almost certainly represent preexisting lesions.
post-absorptive drugs
metformin
metformin is a biguanide approved for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, a disease that
is exacerbated by obesity and weight gain. metformin has been associated with signiﬁcant weight loss compared with sulphonylureas or placebo.
campbell et al50 compared metformin and  xxxd2204xxx  in a randomized double-blind
study of type ii diabetic individuals who had failed on diet. the 24 subjects on
metformin lost weight and had a better diabetic control of their fasting glucose and
glycohaemoglobin levels than did the  xxxd2204xxx  group. the  xxxd2204xxx  group gained weight,
and the difference in weight between the two groups at the end of the study was highly
signiﬁcant. in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in subjects with the insulin resistance syndrome, metformin also increased weight loss. fontbonne et al51 reported the
results from the bigpro study, a 1-year french multicentre study that compared
metformin with placebo in 324 middle-aged subjects with upper body obesity and the
insulin resistance syndrome. the subjects on metformin lost signiﬁcantly more weight
(1–2 kg) than did the placebo group, and the study concluded that metformin might
have a role in the primary prevention of type ii diabetes mellitus.
the package insert for metformin52 describes a 29-week double-blind study
comparing  xxxd2215xxx  20 mg per day with metformin 2.5 g per day and their combination in 632 type ii diabetic subjects who had inadequate glucose control. the
metformin group lost 3.8 kg compared with a loss of 0.3 kg in the  xxxd2215xxx  group and
a gain of 0.4 kg in the combined group. the package insert also describes a doubleblind controlled study in poorly controlled type ii diabetic subjects comparing
metformin 2.5 g per day with placebo. weight loss in the placebo group was 1.1 kg
compared with 0.64 kg in the metformin group.
lee and morley53, however, compared 48 type ii diabetic women in a double-blind,
controlled trial randomizing subjects to metformin 850 mg twice daily or a placebo.
subjects on metformin lost 8.8 kg over 24 weeks compared with only 1.0 kg in the
placebo group, a highly signiﬁcant difference (p <0.001). although metformin may not
give enough weight loss to receive an indication from the fda for treating obesity, it
certainly deserves consideration in obese type ii diabetic individuals who have failed diet
and exercise treatment for their diabetes. metformin has also been used in children.54
drugs approved by the fda but for an indication other than obesity
androgens and androgen antagonists
dehydroepiandrosterone. dehydroepiandrosterone (dhea; ∆5-androstene-3-beta-hydroxy17-one) is produced by the adrenal gland. in humans, this steroid and its sulphated
derivative are the most abundant steroids produced by the adrenal gland. dhea levels
decline with age in men and women.55 mice, rats, cats and dogs fed dhea lose weight.
a recent structure function analysis by lardy et al56 showed that the biological effect on
body fat of dhea-related steroids was greatest with 7-oxo-dhea derivatives.
several clinical studies with dhea have been carried out.57 in a study lasting 28 days

drug treatment of obesity

143

with 10 normal-weight volunteers, dhea at 1600 mg per day, near the limit at which
hepatic toxicity is a risk, had no effect on body weight or on insulin sensitivity as assessed
by the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp.58 a similar study showed no effect of dhea
on energy expenditure, body composition or protein turnover.59 after 28 days of
treatment with dhea, obese male volunteers showed no improvement in body fat or
insulin sensitivity.60 in obese female volunteers, there was similarly no change in body fat,
but there was a decrease in insulin sensitivity.61 based on these negative studies in both
lean and obese human subjects, it appears that dhea is ineffective in human obesity. a
steroid derivative of dhea called  xxxd603xxx  has, in one preliminary study, been
suggested to reduce body weight.62 more data are awaited.
testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. testosterone is the principal product of the testis
and is responsible for masculinization. the inverse relationship between testosterone
and visceral fat in men suggested the possibility that visceral fat might be reduced by
treatment with testosterone. marin et al63–65 have evaluated this in two trials using men
with low-normal circulating testosterone levels (<20 nmol/l) and a body mass index
(bmi) of over 25 kg/m2. in the ﬁrst trial, testosterone 80 mg twice daily was given orally
as the undecenoate. the 11 men who received testosterone had a signiﬁcant decrease
of visceral fat mass as measured by computed tomography compared with the 12 men
who received placebo for 8 months. there were no changes in body mass, subcutaneous fat mass or lean body mass. insulin sensitivity was improved.63 in a second
trial by marin et al64, 31 men were randomly allocated to three groups receiving either
placebo, testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. the testosterone was given as a gel
with 5 g containing 125 mg testosterone applied to the arms daily. the dihydrotestosterone was applied in a similar gel at the same dose. the placebo group received
only the gel. after 9 months, the testosterone-treated group showed a signiﬁcant
decrease in waist circumference and visceral fat.
two additional studies have examined the effects of anabolic steroids in men and
women.66,67 the ﬁrst was a 9-month trial on 30 healthy overweight men with mean bmi
values of 33.8–34.5 kg/m2 and testosterone values between 2 and 5 ng/ml.68 during the
ﬁrst 3 months, when an oral anabolic steroid ( xxxd2806xxx ) was given daily, there was
a signiﬁcantly greater decrease in subcutaneous fat and a greater fall in visceral fat than
in the groups treated with placebo or  xxxd3326xxx  injected every 2 weeks.
because of the drop in hdl-cholesterol, which is a known side-effect of oral anabolic
steroids69, the anabolic steroid group was changed to an injectable drug, nandrolone
 xxxd1821xxx . the effects were similar to those of  xxxd3326xxx . the data with
testosterone given as a bi-weekly injection did not replicate the data of marin et al63,64,
and the bi-weekly injections of nandrolone failed to maintain the difference seen in
daily treatment with  xxxd2806xxx . this suggests that, to obtain the visceral effects with
steroids, frequent if not daily administration may be needed.
drugs that increase energy expenditure
drugs approved by the fda for an indication other than obesity
ephedrine with and without caffeine
ephedrine is a phenylpropanolamine. the hydroxyl group on the alpha carbon prolongs
its duration of action, and the methyl group on the beta carbon, as well as the amino

144

g. a. bray

group, increases its peripheral actions and decreases its central actions on adrenergic
receptors.
the mechanism by which ephedrine affects weight is due, at least in part, to its effect
on thermogenesis. astrup et al70 demonstrated that the excess oxygen consumption,
compared with placebo, in the 3 hours following an oral dose of ephedrine of 1 mg/kg
was 1.3 ± 1.1 and 1.2 ± 1.1 litres before and 2 months after chronic treatment with
ephedrine 60 mg per day. this can be compared with an increase in oxygen consumption of 7.0 ± 2.3 and 6.9 ± 1.8 litres after 4 and 12 weeks of continuous treatment
(p <0.01). obese subjects have been shown to have a reduced thermogenic response to
cold exposure and to ephedrine. the thermogenic response to cold exposure was not
affected by 5 weeks of exercise training, but the thermogenic response to ephedrine
was slightly improved (1.1 ± .23 versus 1.4 ± .17 kj/kg lean body mass (lbm)/180
minutes, p <0.06).71 thermogenesis may be only one way in which ephedrine exerts its
effect. jonderko and kucio72 have demonstrated that ephedrine 50 mg orally signiﬁcantly
delays gastric emptying compared with a placebo. the amount of food remaining in the
stomach after 90 minutes was 70.3 ± 5.1% after placebo and 80.9 ± 3% in the ephedrine
group (p <0.02), which may represent a mechanism for decreased hunger.
in a 6-month trial, astrup et al73 compared placebo, caffeine 200 mg three times day,
ephedrine 20 mg three times daily, and the combination of caffeine 200 mg three times
a day with ephedrine 20 mg/three times per day in 180 obese subjects (figure 5).
withdrawals were equal in all groups, and 141 subjects completed the trial. weight
loss was signiﬁcantly greater in the group receiving both caffeine and ephedrine
(16.6 ± 8.6 kg versus 13.2 ± 6.6 kg, p <0.0015). weight losses in the caffeine-only group
and the ephedrine-only group were no different from those open in the placebo group.
side-effects of tremor, insomnia and dizziness were transient and, by 8 weeks, were
no different from those of in the placebo group. blood pressure fell equally in all four
groups. after 6 months, the medication was stopped for 2 weeks to assess withdrawal
symptoms. one hundred and twenty-seven subjects then entered a 6-month openlabel study of caffeine 600 mg per day with ephedrine 60 mg per day.73,74 the 99
subjects who completed the study lost an additional 1.1 kg (p <0.02), and no clinically
signiﬁcant withdrawal symptoms were observed (figure 5). caffeine and ephedrine,
like phentermine and fenﬂuramine in the one other long-term controlled trial that
combined two medications for weight loss, gave a 16% loss of initial weight over 6
months, which was maintained for the remainder of the year of treatment.
␤3-adrenergic receptor agonists in the early stages of drug development
the sympathetic nervous system has a tonic role in maintaining energy expenditure
and blood pressure. blockade of the thermogenic part of this system will reduce the
thermic response to a meal. norepinephrine, the neurotransmitter of the sympathetic
nervous system, may also decrease food intake by acting on beta2- or  xxxg838xxx -adrenergic
receptors. several synthetic  xxxg838xxx -agonists have been developed against the animal
 xxxg838xxx -receptor, but the clinical responses have been disappointing. after cloning of the
human  xxxg838xxx -receptor, a new round of compounds are being synthesized that will soon
be tried in obese human subjects.

evaluation of an overweight patient.4 those patients who have a bmi above 30 kg/m2
are potential candidates for drug therapy. the presence of co-morbidities such as
dyslipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, symptomatic
osteoarthritis or sleep apnoea increases the rationale for treatment by shifting the bmi
from 27–30 kg/m2 to a risk-adjusted weight index above 30 kg/m2.
the currently available noradrenergic sympathomimetic drugs can reduce body
weight, but only sibutramine has been approved for long-term use. this drug should
not be used in patients with stroke, congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction.
the probable approval of orlistat will further expand the therapeutic armamentarium
of the physician.
a weight loss of 10–15% can improve health risks. however, failure to lose weight
or failure to improve co-morbid conditions indicates either non-compliance with the
drug or that the patient is not responding to the drug. either setting requires the reevaluation of therapy and the addition of other medications or other modalities of
treatment. as a guideline, patients being treated with drugs should lose more than 2 kg
in the ﬁrst month and achieve more than a 5% weight loss by 6 months. as long as
weight loss is more than 5% and/or the patient’s co-morbidities have responded, the
drug can be continued. the data with phentermine (figure 2) suggests that intermittent use may be beneﬁcial.
at least two groups of patients merit long-term drug therapy. the ﬁrst is patients
who are considered for surgical treatment of their obesity. individuals with a bmi or
risk-adjusted weight index of above 35 kg/m2 should ﬁrst be treated with anti-obesity
drugs. if they respond with more than a 15% weight loss, drugs should be continued
as long as they respond and their co-morbidities improve. the second group of
patients who deserve vigorous treatment is those with sleep apnoea. a modest weight
loss is often sufﬁcient to alleviate their problem.
