1  xxxd2142xxx  has been claimed to bind to a high affinity site in the calcium channel in skeletal muscle.
we have investigated its calcium-antagonistic effects in smooth muscle and affinity for the channel in
radioligand binding assays.
2  xxxd2142xxx  was weakly active as an antagonist of ca2+-induced contractions in k+-depolarized
taenia preparations from the guinea-pig caecum, with threshold antagonism starting from concentrations
of 30nm.  xxxd2737xxx ,  xxxd2718xxx  and  xxxd2728xxx  were very potent antagonists in this model (threshold
antagonism, > 1 nm).
3 in contrast,  xxxd2142xxx  (10-1000nm) was a potent non-competitive antagonist of the effects of bay k
8644 (1-3000nm) on ca2"-induced contractions and, at lonm, selectively antagonised the effects of bay k
8644, abolished the ca 2+-channel activator effects of cgp 28392, without changing the calcium antagonist effects of  xxxd2737xxx , or modifying the sensitivity of the tissues to ca2 +. in contrast, the dihydropyridines were more effective as antagonists of ca2+ than of bay k 8644.  xxxd2142xxx  therefore selectively
antagonised the effects of dihydropyridine ca2 + channel activators without affecting the antagonist
potency.

4 in radioligand binding experiments,  xxxd2142xxx  was a potent displacer of [3h]-pn-200-1 10 binding to
rat cerebral cortical membranes (ec50 30nm), albeit with a low hill slope (0.66), and was more potent
than other lipophilic diphenylalkylamines such as  xxxd2125xxx  and lidoflazine.  xxxd2142xxx  interacted noncompetitively with [3h]-pn-200-1 10 and increased dissociation of the radioligand.

introduction
it is'now clear that there are three distinct binding sites for
selective calcium-antagonists on the  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx  protein of the
l-type calcium channel: a dihydropyridine site, a site for
phenylalkylamines such as verapamil and a site of benzothiazepines such as diltiazem (glossmann et al., 1985; mir &
spedding, 1987). however, although the lipophilic
diphenylalkylamines, fendiline,  xxxd3007xxx ,  xxxd2125xxx ,  xxxd1704xxx , lidoflazine and  xxxd2956xxx  (class iii calcium antagonists, spedding, 1985a,b) have been claimed to be calcium
antagonists since the initiation of the concept of this class of
drugs (e.g. godfraind & kaba, 1969; fleckenstein, 1983), their
mode of action has been much disputed, on the basis that the
drugs have little selectivity for ca2+ channels compared with
na' channels (grima et al., 1986), may inhibit the contractile
proteins directly (spedding, 1983) and may interfere with
calmodulin-dependent processes (see spedding, 1985b for a
review). thus it is not clear if these drugs act directly at the
calcium channel, or at other sites. in this respect, the lipophilic
nature of these agents (spedding, 1985a) and their low affinity
for the ca2+ channel has precluded their being used in the
tritiated form to define their site of action.
we were therefore interested by the finding that  xxxd2142xxx ,
a lipophilic diphenylalkylamine used as a neuroleptic, had
very high affinity for the ca2+ channels in skeletal muscle
(galizzi et al., 1986; qar et al., 1987), so that [3h]- xxxd2142xxx 
could be used as a radioligand. we have tested  xxxd2142xxx  in
a well characterized model for studying the functional effects
of calcium antagonists in k+-depolarized smooth muscle: the
taenia from the guinea-pig caecum. interactions with ca2+
channel activators such as bay k 8644 (schramm et al., 1983)
may be used to define the site of action of calcium antagonists.
dihydropyridine activators and antagonists interact competitively (spedding & berg, 1984; su et al., 1984; spedding,
1985b), verapamil and diltiazem interact non-competitively
with bay k 8644 (su et al., 1984; spedding & berg, 1984;
spedding, 1985a,b), whereas the effects of the lipophilic
diphenylalkylamines are not reversed by bay k 8644

(spedding & berg, 1984; spedding, 1985a; boddeke et al.,
1988; patmore & duncan, 1988). these functional interactions reflect the allosteric interactions of the drugs at their
respective binding sites (glossmann et al., 1985; janis et al.,
1987) and are considered to be criteria for the classification of
calcium antagonists (vanhoutte & paoletti, 1987). using these
criteria to define the site of action of  xxxd2142xxx , we found
that  xxxd2142xxx  selectively antagonised bay k 8644 without
modifying the effects of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists.
the potency of  xxxd2142xxx  in displacing tritiated ligands
from the ca2 + channels in rat cerebial cortex membranes was
also investigated; binding of dihydropyridines to cortical
membranes is similar to that in smooth muscle membranes
(janis et al., 1987). our data confirm and extend previous
results indicating high affinity for an undefined site in the
ca2 + channel in skeletal muscle, with slightly lower affinity in
brain tissue (quirion et al., 1985; galizzi et al., 1986; qar et
al., 1987). also, they show that  xxxd2142xxx  interacts noncompetitively with the dihydropyridine site, but do not fully
explain the selectivity against the calcium channel activators
which we find in functional experiments.

methods
strips of taenia (1-2mm diameter, 1.5-2cm relaxed length)
from the caecum of female guinea-pigs (200-350g) were set up
in 30 ml isolated organ baths containing k+-tyrode solution
which was gassed with 95% 02: 5% co2 and maintained at
35°c (spedding, 1982). the k+-tyrode solution had the following composition (mmol i-1): naci 97, kci 40, nahco3
11.9, nah2po4 0.4, glucose 5.5. the preparations were
washed in the ca2 + -free, 40 mmol 11 k+ -tyrode solution for
30min, by which time they were fully relaxed. contractile
responses were measured under isotonic conditions (1 g load)
with harvard or bioscience isotonic transducers connected to
bbc goetz se460 potentiometric recorders. cumulative
concentration-response curves to ca2 + (10-3000jumol lwere obtained by increasing the ca2 + concentration at
3-5 min intervals in logarithmic increments (van rossum,
1963). when concentration-response curves were repeated the
curves were obtained at 30min intervals. antagonists were

preincubated for 30 min. concentration-ratios were calculated
as the ratios of the concentrations of ca2+ which produced a
50% maximal response (ec50) in the presence and in the
absence of the antagonists. in the experiments where bay k
8644 was used the preparations were partially contracted with
ca2+ and bay k 8644 added in a cumulative fashion, so that
the increase in tone was taken as a percentage of the increase
in contraction, as a fraction of the total increase possible
(taken from the maximum response to ca2").
student's t test was used for comparisons of mean values
and the mann-whitney u test for comparison of % changes.
concentration-ratios were calculated, and tested for statistical differences, in logarithmic units and the antilogarithms
are quoted in the test. standard errors of the mean are illustrated on percentage changes for representational purposes

obtained by the non-linear least square fitting programme
'ligand' (munson & rodbard, 1980).

drugs
the following drugs were used: bay k 8644 (methyl-1,4dihydro - 2,6 - dimethyl - 3 - nitro - 4 - (2 - trifluoromethylphenyl) pyridine-5-carboxylate), nifedipine,  xxxd2734xxx  (bayer ag,
leverkusen, frg),  xxxd2718xxx  (syntex),  xxxd2142xxx , lidoflazine and  xxxd2125xxx  tartrate (jannssen), pn
200-110 (isopropyl-4-(2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,4-dihydro-2,
6-dimethyl-5-methoxy-carbonylpyridine-3-carboxylate) and
cgp
28392
(4-[24difluoromethoxy)-phenyl]1,4,5,7tetrahydro - 2 - methyl - 5 - oxofluoro[3,4 - b]pyridine - 3 carboxylic acid ethylester).
dihydropyridines were dissolved in ethanol (1 or
30 mmol i1- ), before being diluted in distilled water. stock solutions were kept at 0°c for up to 12 h and aqueous dilutions
prepared immediately before use. all solutions were shielded
from light. the other drugs were dissolved in distilled water,
with the exception of  xxxd2142xxx  which has very low aqueous
solubility (lopgml-1) and was consequently dissolved in
ethanol. the maximum concentration of ethanol in the
bathing medium was <0.03%; this concentration did not
affect responses to bay k 8644.

[3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 binding to rat cerebral cortex
membranes were prepared from the cerebral cortex of male
sprague-dawley rats by homogenization of the tissue in 30
volumes of ice-cold 50mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4 at 250c) with a
polytron tissue disruptor (setting 8, two los bursts) followed
by centrifugation at 48,000 gay, at 40c for 15 min. the resulting
pellet was washed twice by resuspension and centrifugation
under the conditions described. the final pellet was
resuspended in buffer and aliquots were stored under liquid
nitrogen until required for assay.
membrane aliquots (0.1-0.15mgml-1) were incubated in
50mm tris-hcl (ph 7.4 at 250c) with [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110
(30 pm for competition studies, 0.005-1.0 nm for saturation
studies) in a total volume of 2.0ml. incubations were carried
out for 100 min at 25°c, after which the reaction was terminated by the addition of 5.0ml ice-cold 50mm tris-hcl and
rapid filtration over whatman gf b filters by use of a
brandel cell harvester. the filters were washed twice with icecold buffer and the bound radioactivity determined by liquid
scintillation counting. non-specific binding was determined in
the presence of 1.0jum  xxxd2737xxx . for competition experiments, assays were carried out with at least 10 concentrations
of competing drug and the resulting displacement curves were
analysed by a non-linear least square parametric curve fitting
program. equilibrium binding parameters (kd and bmax) were

the antagonism by the dihydropyridines was non-competitive

potent, in that threshold antagonism occurred at 100 nm

dependent augmentation of the contraction.  xxxd2142xxx  (11000 nm) antagonised the responses to bay k 8644 in a
concentration-dependent, but non-competitive, manner,
reducing the maximum response, with a pd2 of 8.3 (figure
2d). in contrast,  xxxd2718xxx  (0.1, 1 nm) did not significantly
affect the response to bay k 8644 and at higher concentrations (10nm) shifted the curve to the right, without depressing
the maximum response (figure 2). similarly,  xxxd2737xxx  and
 xxxd2728xxx  did not depress the maximum response to bay k
8644 and antagonism was seen only at low concentrations of
bay k 8644; indeed some augmentation of the response was
apparent with high concentrations (figure 2). in these experiments, progressively higher concentrations of ca2 + (0.3, 1, 3,
10mm) were used to recontract the tissues to 25-45% of the
maximum contraction before the addition of bay k 8644
when the dihydropyridines were used, but this was not necessary in the  xxxd2142xxx  experiments as the sensitivity to ca2 +
was hardly impaired. this means that the apparently
increased responses to bay k 8644 seen after exposure to
 xxxd2728xxx  and  xxxd2737xxx  could be secondary to an
increase in the driving force for ca2+ entry, so that channels
which were unblocked by bay k 8644 would pass more ca2 +
than under control conditions.
in order to control for this difference,  xxxd2142xxx  (100nm)
was added in the presence or absence of  xxxd2728xxx  (10nm)
and the effects of bay k 8644 tested (figure 3).  xxxd2142xxx 
(100 nm for 25 min) did not antagonise the responses to ca2+
in that 0.3 mm ca2+ caused a large contraction (47 + 5%
max), but the activator effects of bay k 8644 were almost
abolished.  xxxd2728xxx  (10 nm for 25 min) in these experiments
abolished the contraction to 3mm ca2+, yet this inhibition
was reversed fully by bay k 8644. a combination of  xxxd2142xxx  (100 nm) and  xxxd2728xxx  (1o nm) also abolished the effects
of 3 mm ca2 +, but the sensitivity to bay k 8644 was reduced
30 fold by  xxxd2142xxx . the slightly greater contraction
induced by bay k 8644 in the presence of  xxxd2142xxx  and
 xxxd2728xxx , compared with that seen with  xxxd2142xxx  alone,
can probably be attributed to the increased ca2+ concentration (3 mm compared with 0.3 mm) increasing ca2 + flux
through such channels as were activated by bay k 8644.

in order to assess whether  xxxd2142xxx  affected the potency
of dihydropyridine calcium antagonists a series of experiments
was performed in parallel (figure 4a).  xxxd2142xxx  (lonm) did
not change the sensitivity of the taenia to ca2", nor did it
change the antagonistic effects of  xxxd2737xxx  (1 nm; control
mean ca2+ concentration-ratio 4.4, n = 10; in the presence of
 xxxd2142xxx  5.5, n = 10, p > 0.5). however, this concentration
of  xxxd2142xxx  markedly antagonised the effects of bay k 8644
and completely antagonised the calcium channel activator
effects of cgp 28392, revealing weak antagonistic effects
(figure 4b).
 xxxd2142xxx  is a potent dopamine antagonist, but this property does not relate directly to the antagonism of the effects
of bay k 8644 because sulpiride (10pm) did not antagonise
the effects of bay k 8644 in four experiments (data not
shown).

characteristics of [3h]- xxxd2405xxx -1 10 binding to rat
cerebral cortex
binding of [3h]-(+)- xxxd2405xxx -110 to rat cerebral cortex was
saturable, reversible and of high affinity. iterative non-linear

saturation isotherms of [3h]- xxxd2405xxx -110 binding to rat cerebral cortical membranes in the presence of  xxxd2142xxx  indicated a non-competitive allosteric interaction, producing a
decrease in kd and bmax from control (kd 0.03 + 0.007 nm,

0.063 + 0.01 nm, 211 + 16fmolmg'- in the presence of 10-8m
 xxxd2142xxx , n = 4). in contrast, scatchard transformations in
the presence of nifedipine, a dihydropyridine antagonist, indicated a competitive interaction in that kd was lowered
without a significant change in the number of binding sites
(control values: kd 0.029 + 0.008 nm, b,,,x 221 + 20 fmol

discussion
in this paper we have shown that  xxxd2142xxx  has weak
antagonistic effects on ca2+-induced contractions in k+depolarized smooth muscle, but only at much higher concentrations than are required to interact with binding sites in the
putative ca2+ channels in skeletal muscle (galizzi et al., 1986;
qar et al., 1987). however,  xxxd2142xxx  was much more potent
(threshold 1 nm) in antagonising the effects of bay k 8644 and
at 10nm abolished the augmentation of ca2+-induced contractions seen with cgp 28392. cgp 28392 is a less powerful
activator of calcium channels than bay k 8644 and these
weak effects were more readily antagonised by  xxxd2142xxx . at

concentrations which abolished the effects of cgp 28392,  xxxd2142xxx  did not significantly affect the contractile responses
to ca2+ or the antagonistic effects of  xxxd2737xxx , indicating
that the drug selectively antagonised the activator, but not the
antagonistic effects of dihydropyridines.
how could this effect come about? a simple explanation
would be that  xxxd2142xxx  prevents the binding of bay k 8644
but not of other dihydropyridines. however, it would appear
likely that activator and antagonist dihydropyridines bind to
a single site and can stabilize different states of the ca2 +
channel, with evidence from electrophysiological studies (e.g.
sanguinetti et al., 1986) and from conformational energy calculations (mahmoudian & richards, 1986; holtje & marrer,
1987; see janis et al., 1987). the high affinity binding of [3h]bay k 8644 to cell membranes that has been obtained by
several groups (bellemann, 1984; lee et al., 1987; maan &
hosey, 1987; sarmiento et al., 1987) appears to correlate with
'antagonist' binding to a state of the channel corresponding to
the inactivated state, i.e. there is competition for a single site
between all the dihydropyridines tested. however, maan &
hosey (1987) considered that activator binding was enthalpy
driven and antagonist binding was entropy driven. unfortunately, as yet, there is no clear method of investigating acti-

vated states of the channel in radioligand binding experiments
and we do not consider that bay k 8644 binding labels the
activated form of the channel. we used [3h]-pn-200-1 10 to
label the channel, as it has high affinity and labels a large
number of channels (high b,,,.) due to its high affinity for the
inactivated state (glossmann et al., 1985). saturation studies
indicated a non-competitive interaction of  xxxd2142xxx  with the
[3h]- xxxd2405xxx  binding site.  xxxd2142xxx  increased the dissociation of the radioligand from its site, compatible with an
allosteric interaction between the site for  xxxd2142xxx  and the
dihydropyridine binding site. further studies indicated similar
interactions if [3h]- xxxd2737xxx  was used as the radioligand
(data not shown).  xxxd2142xxx  may therefore resemble other
diphenylalkylamines such as  xxxd2125xxx  and lidoflazine, but
not verapamil on the grounds that verapamil does not fully
displace dihydropyridine binding (glossmann et al., 1985;
janis et al., 1987) and the effects of verapamil are readily
reversed by bay k 8644 (spedding & berg, 1984; su et al.,
1984; spedding, 1985a). thus,  xxxd2142xxx  has affinity for a
distinct site on the calcium channel, as assessed by dihydropyridine binding, but we have no evidence for a selective inhibition of 'activator' binding by the drug. indeed the weak
inhibitory effects of cgp 28392 in the presence of  xxxd2142xxx 
may point to binding being unaffected, but the activator
effects being selectively antagonised.
the conclusion from these results is that the site for  xxxd2142xxx  is only weakly linked to the dihydropyridine site, but
that binding of  xxxd2142xxx  changes the channel such that the
ability of activators to be effective is suppressed, whereas the
effects of antagonists are less affected.
the low hill slope observed in the [3h]-pn-200-1 10 displacement studies indicates that the ec50 for  xxxd2142xxx  can
only be used as an empirical estimate of potency, even though
 xxxd2142xxx  was considerably more potent than the other
diphenylalkylamines tested. in this respect, it may be considered as a prototypical agent for this class of drugs. thus,
the selective antagonism of bay k 8644 does indicate that the
site of these drugs is, if not at the dihydropyridine site, at least
tightly coupled to the calcium channel.  xxxd2125xxx  and lidoflazine have also been shown to be effective antagonists of the
effects of bay k 8644 (spedding & berg, 1984; boddeke et al.,
1988; patmore & duncan, 1988), but the present study is the
first to show that certain concentrations may selectively
antagonise the effects of calcium channel activators.
however, despite the high affinity of  xxxd2142xxx  for a site in
the ca2+ channel, in preliminary experiments we did not
observe specific binding of [3h]- xxxd2142xxx  to rat cerebral
cortex membranes under a range of experimental conditions,

presumably because of high non-specific binding as demonstrated by galizzi et al. (1986). these authors only found specific binding in skeletal muscle, where the high density of sites
increases the signal to noise ratio. further progress in this
field with radioligand binding techniques will require conditions that allow stabilization of the activated state of the channels and demonstrable high affinity binding by [3h] xxxd2142xxx  in all relevant tissues.

in conclusion, we have shown that  xxxd2142xxx , at concentrations which non-competitively modify dihydropyridine
binding, selectively antagonises the effects of calcium-channel
activators and that this drug may be considered as a useful
experimental tool to define the effects of the lipophilic
diphenylalkylamines classified as class iii calcium antagonists
(spedding, 1985a,b).
