abstract besides their involvement in the control of nuclear
gene expression by activating several peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptors (ppars), peroxisome proliferators influence
mitochondrial activity. by analogy with the previous characterization of a mitochondrial t3 receptor ( xxxg2360xxx ), we searched for the
presence of a peroxisome proliferator target in the organelle.
using several antisera raised against different domains of
ppars, we demonstrated by western blotting, immunoprecipitation and electron microscopy experiments, that a 45 kda
protein related to pparqq2 (mt-ppar) is located in the matrix
of rat liver mitochondria. in addition, we found that the amounts
of mt-ppar are increased by  xxxd1724xxx  treatment. moreover, in
emsa experiments mt-ppar bound to a dr2 sequence located
in the mitochondrial d-loop, by forming a complex with  xxxg2360xxx .
last, studies of tissue-specific expression indicated that mtppar is detected in mitochondria of all tissues tested except the
brain in amounts positively related to  xxxg2360xxx  abundance. ß 2000

1. introduction
thyromimetic e¡ects of peroxisome proliferators (pps) have
been reported earlier [1^3]. as thyroid hormone, they are
potent hypolipidemic agents [4,5]. in rats, several pps induce
the expression of enzymes regulated by thyroid hormone, such
as malic enzyme, mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,  xxxg825xxx , and s14 [5].
last, as thyroid hormone, pps a¡ect mammalian mitochondrial activity [6^8]. triiodothyronine (t3) is considered to be
the major regulator of mammalian mitochondrial biogenesis
[9]. interestingly, pps also alter mitochondrial morphology
and enzyme composition [10^12]. in addition, they increase
mitochondrial mrna and rrna levels [1].
recently, we provided evidence that a 43 kda c-erb a k1
protein ( xxxg2360xxx ) located in the mitochondrial matrix of rat liver

[13], is a mitochondrial transcription factor [14]. these data
underlined the occurrence of a novel endocrine pathway exerted at the mitochondrial level, involving a truncated nuclear
receptor acting as a transcription factor.
on the basis of these observations, in the present study, we
searched for the presence of protein(s) related to ppar in
mitochondria. we report here the occurrence in the mitochondrial matrix of a 45 kda protein related to pparq2 (mtppar) whose abundance is upregulated by clo¢brate, and
which speci¢cally binds to a dr2 sequence located in the
d-loop of the mitochondial genome.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and mitochondrial preparation
male wistar rats (body weights ranging from 200 to 300 g) received
a daily intramuscular injection of 0.56 nmol clo¢brate during 7 days.
rats of the same bred and same body weight receiving only the
clo¢brate vehicle were used as a control. liver mitochondria were
prepared by di¡erential centrifugations and purity of mitochondrial
preparations was tested as previously described [13]. membrane and
matrix extracts were collected as previously described [15].
2.2. production of antibodies raised against several ppar isoforms
for immunization we used the following sequences of human
ppar peptides coupled to bovine  xxxg124xxx  and subcutaneously
injected into rabbits using standard procedures: anti-ppark
(ssgsfgfteyqye, amino acids 45^57 of human ppark); antipparn (egapelnggpqhal, amino acids 24^37 of human
 xxxg1806xxx ); anti-pparq1/q2 (empfwptnfgissvd, amino acids 7^
21 of human pparq1, 35^49 of human pparq2); anti-pparq2
(getlgdspidpesds, 2^16 of human pparq2); anti-ppars
(daalhpllqeiyrdmy, amino acids 453^468 of rat ppark).
the anti-pparq was provided by a¤nity bioreagents inc. (interchim).
2.3. immunoprecipitation and western blotting
immunoprecipitations of mitochondrial proteins were performed
with anti-pparq2 and anti-ppars antisera. puri¢ed mitochondrial
extracts (200 wg) were mixed with 1 wl antiserum and 300 wl binding
bu¡er (hepes 50 mm, nacl 400 mm, nonidet p40 1%, aprotinin
1 wg/ml, phenylmethylsulfonyl £uoride 100 wg/ml), during 3 h at 4³c.
samples were incubated with 30 wl protein g^sepharose for 1 h at
4³c, and washed four times with binding bu¡er. immunoprecipitation
speci¢city was assessed in each case by using the related pre-immune
rabbit serum.
proteins were electrophoresed (sds^page), transferred to a
pdvf membrane and detected by a chemiluminescent western blot
procedure (ecf kit, amersham). in western blot experiments,

ppars proteins used as control were synthesized in vitro using reticulocyte lysate (promega) and [35 s]methionine with the following vector: psg5-mppark, psg5-mpparn, psg5-mpparq1 and pbsiikhpparq2 (gift of prof. w. wahli, lausanne, switzerland).
2.4. gel mobility shift assays
gel mobility shift assays were performed as reported previously
[14], using a 32 p-labeled oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the
mitochondrial dr2 sequence identi¢ed in the rat mitochondrial genome (gtcaaggcatgaaggtcagcac) [14]. speci¢city of
dna binding was tested by addition of cold related or unrelated
probe as described [14].

3. results
3.1. a 45 kda protein related to pparq2 is detected in the
mitochondrial matrix
in order to test the possibility that the in£uence of pps at
the mitochondrial level could, at least partly, involve a direct
target located in the organelle, we searched for the presence of
ppar-related proteins in rat liver mitochondria. in this purpose, western blot analysis using six antisera (four antibodies
were directed against di¡erent sequences of pparq) raised
against the four ppar isoforms were performed in highly

puri¢ed rat liver mitochondrial extracts. ppar proteins synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate were used as control. in
all cases, related pre-immune sera were tested and did not
detect any mitochondrial protein (data not shown). whereas
no signal was observed with antisera speci¢cally raised against
ppark and n (fig. 1a,b), a 45 kda protein was detected
using two other antibodies raised against sequences respectively located in the hinge region and the amino-terminus of
both pparq1 and q2 (fig. 1d,e). further experiments using
an antiserum raised against another amino-terminal sequence
to pparq2 isoform also led to the detection of a 45 kda
protein (fig. 1c). altogether, this set of data indicated that
a 45 kda protein displaying three di¡erent sequences immunologically related to the nuclear receptor pparq2 is located
in mitochondria (mt-ppar). however, the molecular weight
of this protein is clearly less when compared to that of pparq2
(56 kda). therefore, we tested the possibility that mt-ppar
could lack a part of the carboxy-terminus domain of ppar
isoforms. in agreement with this hypothesis, western blot experiments using an antiserum raised against a carboxy-terminal sequence well conserved in all ppar isoforms failed to
detect a mitochondrial protein (fig. 1f).

immunoprecipitation experiments using antiserum raised

membrane and matrix extracts was assessed by cytochrome
oxidase (inner membrane) and  xxxg522xxx  (matrix) activities (data not shown). our results con¢rmed our previous
western blot data, and brought evidence that mt-ppar was
located in the mitochondrial matrix (fig. 1g). in well agreement with this set of results, electron microscopy studies performed with the antiserum raised against the speci¢c pparq2

sequence allowed us to directly observe the occurrence of a
pparq2-related protein in mitochondria of rat liver (fig. 2).
interestingly, rat clo¢brate treatment induced an increase in
the number of gold particles present in the organelle (fig. 2c
vs. 2b).
3.2. the 45 kda protein related to pparq2 is induced by a
clo¢brate treatment
in order to con¢rm this clo¢brate in£uence, we performed a
western blot using the antiserum raised against the speci¢c
pparq2 sequence and highly puri¢ed liver mitochondrial extracts from untreated or clo¢brate treated rats. mt-ppar
abundance was assessed by scanning (phosphorimager) and
normalization relatively to e2-pdh, a mitochondrial invariant. we observed that clo¢brate induced an up to two fold
increase in the mitochondrial amounts of mt-ppar (fig. 3).
3.3. mt-ppar speci¢cally binds to a mitochondrial dna
sequence located in the d-loop
ppar isoforms have been shown to stimulate transcription
after binding to repetitions of the aggtca consensus sequence occurring in the promoter of target genes. we have
previously identi¢ed several related motifs in rat mitochondrial genome, inducing binding of  xxxg2360xxx , a mitochondrial truncated form of the t3 nuclear receptor c-erb a k1 [14]. interestingly, one of these motifs, a dr2 sequence, has been
previously described to be a ppre [16,17]. in gel retardation

assays using highly puri¢ed mitochondrial protein extracts
prepared on heparin agarose columns which contain mtppar (fig. 4a), we observed that a mitochondrial protein
complex bound to a probe corresponding to this dr2 sequence (fig. 4b, lane 2). in addition, this binding was e¤ciently competed by an excess of the corresponding cold probe
(fig. 4b, lanes 3 and 4), whereas an unrelated probe was
ine¤cient (fig. 4b, lane 5), thus demonstrating binding speci¢city. as previously reported [13,14], an antibody raised
against c-erb a strongly inhibited binding of the mitochondrial complex to the dr2 probe, thus indicating that  xxxg2360xxx  is a
major element of such a complex (fig. 4c, lane 8). interestingly, preincubation of mitochondrial preparations with an
antibody raised against the pparq1/q2 proteins also inhibited
the binding of this complex (fig. 4c, lane 9), whereas nonrelated antibodies (raised against adp/atp translocator) did
not (fig. 4c, lane 10). this set of data clearly suggests that
 xxxg2360xxx  and mt-ppar occur in the same protein complex.
3.4. mt-ppar is detected in mitochondria extracted from
di¡erent rat tissues
in western blot experiments using the antiserum speci¢cally
raised against pparq2, we studied the relative mitochondrial
amounts of mt-ppar in several tissues. as shown in fig. 5a,
important levels of this protein were detected in heart and
brown adipose tissue mitochondria; mt ppar was also recorded in slightly lower amounts in liver, whereas kidney,
muscle and white adipose tissue displayed more reduced levels. strikingly, mt-ppar was not detected in brain mitochondria. these data underline that expression of this protein displays a strong tissue-speci¢city, very close to  xxxg2360xxx  distribution
in several tissues (fig. 5a,b).

several studies brought evidence that pps regulate mitochondrial activity, in a way displaying strong similarities
with thyroid hormone action. in particular, as t3, they a¡ect
mitochondriogenesis [10^12] and mitochondrial genome expression [1]. these observations raised the question of the
occurrence of a possible cross-talk between the thyroid hormone and pp pathways. we have previously shown that t3
directly acts at the mitochondrial level [13,14]. these data led
us to test the possibility that mitochondrial ppar-related
proteins could directly mediate a part of pps in£uence upon
the organelle activity.
in line with this hypothesis, we detected a 45 kda protein
immunologically related to ppar in the mitochondrial matrix
of rat liver (mt-ppar). as this protein was detected by all
antisera raised against sequences shared by pparq1 and
pparq2, and by an antiserum speci¢cally recognizing the q2
isoform, it was more closely related to pparq2. in addition,
in agreement with the reduced molecular weight of the mitochondrial protein relatively to pparq2 (45 vs. 56 kda), the
mitochondrial protein lacks the carboxy-terminal end of the
nuclear protein. interestingly mt-ppar amounts in the organelle are increased by clo¢brate treatment.
a major question raised by our data is the function of this
mitochondrial protein. in gel mobility shift experiments, we
found that mt-ppar speci¢cally binds to a direct repeat sequence of the aggtca motif (dr2) located in the mitochondrial dna d-loop, a region which contains the pro-

moters of transcription. moreover, we observed that mtppar and  xxxg2360xxx  probably occur in a common complex. in
addition, we have recorded similar patterns of tissue expression for mt-ppar and  xxxg2360xxx . in particular, neither  xxxg2360xxx  nor mtppar were detected in brain mitochondria, whereas they
were strongly expressed in brown adipose tissue. in conclusion, as mt-ppar mitochondrial amounts were increased by
clo¢brate, these data suggest the occurrence of a direct cross
talk between t3 and pps at the mitochondrial level.
