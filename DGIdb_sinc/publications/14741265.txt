abstract—the nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs ﬂurbiprofen and ibuprofen were modiﬁed in an attempt to alter the kinetics of
inhibitor binding by cox-1. contrary to prior predictions, a halogen substituent is not suﬃcient to confer slow tight-binding
behavior. conversion of the carboxylate moiety of ﬂurbiprofen to an ester or amide abolishes slow tight-binding behavior,
regardless of halogenation state.

1. introduction
the cyclooxygenase enzymes (cox-1/2, ec 1.14.99.1)
catalyze important early steps in the biosynthesis of the
prostanoid hormones. these hormones mediate a variety
of physiological processes, including inﬂammation and
platelet aggregation, and have been implicated in pathologies such as cardiovascular disease, alzheimer’s disease,
and colon cancer.13 both isoforms of this enzyme possess
two distinct activities, catalyzing both cyclooxygenase and
peroxidase reactions. the cyclooxygenase active site is the
target of the nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs
(nsaids).4 considerable eﬀort has been invested in the
identiﬁcation of isoform-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors; such molecules oﬀer the promise of modulating
clinically signiﬁcant physiological processes such as
inﬂammation (cox-2) or platelet aggregation (cox-1),
while minimizing unwanted side eﬀects.
most nsaids can be classiﬁed as either slow tightbinding inhibitors (time-dependent binders) or reversible
competitive
inhibitors
(time-independent
binders).57 slow tight-binding behavior is clinically

signiﬁcant, as such behavior can convert a micromolar
inhibitor into a psuedo-irreversible nanomolar inhibitor.8 the slow tight-binding phenomenon appears to
underlie the isoform speciﬁcity of many cox-2 selective
inhibitors; selective compounds are slow tight-binding
inhibitors of the target isoform and reversible competitive inhibitors of the other isoform.911 while a wealth
of structure–activity data has identiﬁed structural
modiﬁcations of nsaids that confer isoform selectivity, there is little structural understanding of the phenomenon of time-dependent inhibition.
early work by rome and lands drew attention to the
carboxylic acid moiety possessed by many nsaids as a
potential determinant of time-dependent inhibition.7
the free carboxylic acid group found in nsaids such
as ﬂurbiprofen and ibuprofen forms critical interactions
with residues arg-120, glu-524, and tyr-355 within the
cyclooxygenase active site,1214 and esteriﬁcation of this
group converts such compounds from time-dependent
to time-independent inhibitors. alteration of the carboxylic acid moiety has recently been exploited to convert nonselective inhibitors into cox-2 selective
inhibitors.1517 rome and lands also hypothesized,
based on a comparison of the chemical structures of
related inhibitors, that a halogen substituent should
confer time-dependent inhibition upon an nsaid.
however, little evidence has been available to test this
hypothesis.

two members of the 2-aryl  xxxd3029xxx  class of
nsaids were used to probe structure–activity relationships relevant to inhibitor binding kinetics.  xxxd2141xxx ,
a halogenated, slow tight-binding inhibitor, potently inhibits cyclooxygenase activity in both isoforms. ibuprofen,
while similar in structure to ﬂurbiprofen, lacks any halogen substituent and is a reversible competitive inhibitor of
both isoforms.10,18 crystal structures are available for
ﬂurbiprofen in complex with both cox-114 and cox-2,13
and for ibuprofen in complex with cox-1.14 the structure–activity ﬁndings are reported here and discussed in
the context of available structural information.
cox-1 enzyme was puriﬁed from ovine seminal vesicles
as described previously;19 purity, as estimated from
coomassie-stained sds page, was greater than 95%.
cyclooxygenase activity was measured at 22  c using a
coupled cyclooxygenase-peroxidase assay, in which the
oxidation of the reducing peroxidase cosubstrate
n,n,n0 ,n0 -tetramethyl-1,4-phenylenediamine (tmpd)
was monitored after the addition of  xxxd208xxx .20
assay conditions were as follows: 0.1 m tris–hcl ph
8.0, 120 mm tmpd, and 80 nm hematin-reconstituted
enzyme; reactions were initiated with 60 mm  xxxd208xxx . because cox-1 auto-inactivates, initial rate
measurements were used in all experiments. ic50 measurements were carried out by pre-warming aliquots of
enzyme to 37  c, adding inhibitor, and incubating at
37  c for an additional 5 min. samples were then cooled
on ice and activity measurements taken. in order to
classify inhibitors as time-dependent or time-independent, time-course experiments were carried out in which
enzyme was pre-warmed to 37  c, inhibitor was added at
time zero, and aliquots were withdrawn for activity measurements at diﬀerent time points. ki and kinact values for
1 and 2 were estimated by incubating enzyme (100 nm)
with 120 mm tmpd and diﬀerent concentrations of
inhibitor at 22  c for varying times, after which the reaction was initiated by the addition of 60 mm arachidonic
acid. control experiments using  xxxd2298xxx  as an
initiator and 250 mm inhibitor showed no peroxidase
inhibition by any of the compounds studied.
to examine the contribution of the ﬂuorine atom to the
kinetic properties of the inhibitor ﬂurbiprofen [1, sigma
chemical (st. louis, mo)], the deﬂuorinated analogue,
2-(1,10 -biphenyl-4-yl)  xxxd3029xxx  (2), was synthesized as described previously.21 compound 2 has previously been shown to be a potent antispasmotic
agent;22 however, no cox inhibition data were available for this compound. racemic preparations of 1 and
2 were used for kinetic analysis, but only the s-enantiomer is expected to bind.12 contrary to the prediction
of rome and lands, removal of the halogen does not
convert ﬂurbiprofen to a reversible competitive inhibitor. however, the ﬂuorine atom does contribute to
potency, 1 being almost three-fold more potent than its
deﬂuorinated analogue 2 (table 1). a similar increase
in potency is associated with the iodination of the timedependent 2-aryl  xxxd3029xxx  nsaid  xxxd3265xxx .23
recently, high-resolution crystal structures of cox-1
in complex with 1 and 2 have become available21
(gupta et al., in preparation). the inhibitors adopt

standard errors were estimated from two independent trials, each

identical positions and orientations in the cyclooxygenase active site, and no changes in the active site geometry
are apparent which could account for the diﬀerence in
potency (fig. 1). two alternate positions have been
identiﬁed for the ﬂuorine atom of ﬂurbiprofen, corresponding to 180 rotations of the phenyl ring; the two
positions have approximately equal occupancies. it is
unclear if one or both of these alternate binding modes
contributes to the greater potency of 1 versus 2.
since 2, like 1, proved to be a time-dependent inhibitor
of cox-1, experiments were undertaken to determine if
removal of the ﬂuorine atom signiﬁcantly alters the
kinetics of binding. the most general model commonly
used for time-dependent inhibition of cox-1 involves
two reversible steps: ﬁrst a rapid reversible binding of
the inhibitor, followed by a second, much slower inactivation step (scheme 1a).24 however, since reversal of
the inactivation step is generally quite slow (k2 < < k2),
a considerably simpler model in which k20 has also
been used (scheme 1b).7
to estimate the parameters associated with the kinetic
model, enzyme can be preincubated with inhibitor, and
then assayed after a time t by addition of a large excess
of substrate ([s] > > km). the excess of substrate ensures
that any enzyme–inhibitor complexes in rapid equilibrium with free enzyme will bind substrate and catalyze
its transformation to product. for such a preincubation
experiment, the simple model shown in scheme 1b predicts that the fractional remaining enzyme activity will
vary with time as follows:7

ki and kinact values for compounds 1 and 2 were determined by ﬁtting to eq 1 above and are summarized in
table 2. the kinetic constants obtained for ﬂurbiprofen
(1) are consistent with previous determinations.6,7,24 the

lower than that determined for 1; however, the rate of
inactivation seen with 2 is only about 20% of the rate
seen with 1. hence, while the ﬂuorine atom might
slightly hinder initial binding within the cyclooxygenase
active site, it appears to enhance the rate of formation
of the ei* complex.

the methyl ester of ﬂurbiprofen (3) is a weak inhibitor
that displays no time-dependence (table 1). interestingly, the methyl ester 7 is over seven-fold more potent
than its halogenated analogue 3. the structural basis for
this is not readily apparent from the crystal structures of
cox-1 bound to 1, 2, and 3. it has recently been shown
that certain carboxylic acid-containing nsaids can
bind to cox-2 in an ‘upside-down’ orientation, with the
acidic group interacting with ser-530, rather than arg120;25 perhaps, in a similar manner, the loss of the ﬂuorine atom allows 7 to ﬂip from the expected orientation
and ﬁnd a more favorable binding site with its ester
moiety in the upper part of the cyclooxygenase channel.

to further probe the structural determinants of slow
tight-binding inhibition in ﬂurbiprofen, derivatives of 1
and 2 in which the carboxylic acid moiety was altered
were synthesized and characterized for their ability to
inhibit cycloxygenase activity in a time-dependent fashion. methyl esters of 1 and 2 were synthesized as
described previously.14 amide and amide-substituted
derivatives of 1 and 2 were produced by using thionyl
chloride to generate the acid chlorides, which were then
treated with the appropriate amines to generate the
amides 4–6 and 8–10 (scheme 2). all preparations used

all of the amide and substituted amide derivatives
examined proved to be reversible competitive inhibitors
of cox-1 (table 1), with no slow tight-binding character.
increasing substitution on the amide moiety decreased
potency in the series derived from compound 1. however,
the same pattern of substitution had the opposite eﬀect in
the dehalogenated series derived from 2: potency
increased with increasing steric bulk at the amide moiety.
this result was unexpected, and the structural basis for
this trend is not understood, as no crystal structure is
currently available for a 2-aryl propionamide nsaid

time–velocity curves were obtained at 5 diﬀerent inhibitor concentrations ranging from 5 to 5000 nm. data from three independent
determinations were combined and simultaneously ﬁt to eq 1 using
graphpad prism 4 nonlinear regression software. asymptotic standard errors were estimated by the program.

complexed with cox. similar conﬂicting trends have
been seen with cox-2 inhibitors; for example, increasing
the bulk of the substituents on indomethacin amides
increases cox-2 inhibitory potency,26 whereas increasing substituent size on meclofenac amides reduces aﬃnity for the enzyme.17
removal of the halogen from the slow tight-binding
inhibitor 1 does not alter its time-dependent character. a
converse approach was also attempted, to determine if the
addition of a halogen to a time-independent inhibitor
could convert it into a slow tight-binding inhibitor. the
reversible competitive inhibitor ibuprofen (11) was nitrated or brominated at the 3-position on the aromatic ring
(analogous to the position of the ﬂuorine substituent in
1), and the products kinetically characterized. the synthetic scheme is described in scheme 2. again, racemic
mixtures were used.
the characteristics of the ibuprofen series are summarized in table 3. like the parent compound 11, both the
3-nitro- and 3-bromo-substituents are reversible competitive inhibitors of cyclooxygenase activity. nitration
reduces potency substantially, increasing the ic50
approximately
60-fold.
however,
bromination
improved the potency 10-fold. this result is surprising,
given the large atomic radius of bromine and the small
size of the constriction (formed by arg-120, glu-524,
and tyr-355) through which the ligand must pass in
order to reach the cyclooxygenase active site. a small
hydrophobic cleft exists within the cox-1 cyclooxygenase active site, and is lined by the side chains of leu352, phe-518, and ile-523. based on the crystal structure
of the cox-1-ibuprofen complex, it is possible to model
13 into the cyclooxygenase site with its bromine substituent pointing into this hydrophobic cleft. the crystal
structure of 11 bound to cox-1 shows that the phenyl
and isobutyl groups of the inhibitor make relatively few
close contacts within the active site, and that the ligand
is somewhat smaller than the actual volume of the
cyclooxygenase active site.14 therefore, the higher
potency of 13 may stem from its improved complementarity with the cox-1 active site (scheme 3).
the results presented in this paper show that halogenation is not a determinant of time-dependent inhibition
in the 2-aryl  xxxd3029xxx  class of nsaids. neither

tion of bromine to ibuprofen was suﬃcient to alter these
inhibitors’ kinetic proﬁles. halogenation does contribute signiﬁcantly to inhibitor potency for compounds
such as 1 and 13; however, this is not generally true, as
the bromo-, chloro-, and iodo- derivatives of the related
nsaid  xxxd2423xxx  are ineﬀective towards cox.27
halogenation can also exert more subtle eﬀects on
nsaid recognition by cox, as is illustrated by the
interplay between the substituents at the 3-position and
the amide group in compounds 4–6 and 8–10.
in contrast, alteration of the carboxylic acid moiety of
2-aryl  xxxd3029xxx  nsaids appears to be a dependable route to abolishing slow tight-binding binding
behavior. these results recapitulate ﬁndings in the
fenamate and indole acetic acid classes of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, where neutralization of the carboxylic
group also leads to reversible competitive inhibitors of
cox-1.15,16,26 the apparent generality of this phenomenon is noteworthy, given that at least one member of
the fenamate class of nsaids, diclofenac, does not
form an ion pair with arg-120.25
