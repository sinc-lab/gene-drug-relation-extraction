design of two etoposide- xxxd168xxx  conjugates:  xxxg2312xxx  and tubuline polymerization inhibition and relation to cytotoxicity.   xxxg2312xxx  represents the main target for the antitumour drugs etoposide and  xxxd168xxx , which are both used clinically. previous studies have shown that the glycoside moiety of etoposide is not necessary for cytotoxicity or  xxxg2312xxx  inhibition. for this reason, we designed two epipodophyllotoxin derivatives for which the dispensable sugar moiety of etoposide has been replaced by a m-methoxy-methane-sulfonamide-anilino group analogous to the  xxxg2312xxx -targeted domain of  xxxd168xxx . we report the synthesis of the hybrid molecules that have the epipodophyllotoxin and anilino groups directly linked (icp-114) or connected by an ethylene spacer (icp-147). plasmid dna relaxation and kinetoplast dna decatenation assays were used to evaluate the effects of the drug on the catalytic activity of human  xxxg2312xxx . we found that the hybrid icp-147 was significantly more potent than both etoposide and  xxxd168xxx  at stimulating dna cleavage by the enzyme, whereas the hybrid icp-114 lacking the linker chain was less potent. icp-147 produces approximately 3 times more double-stranded breaks than icp-114, suggesting that an ethylene spacer between the epipodophyllotoxin and  xxxd168xxx  moieties is highly effective at inhibiting  xxxg2312xxx . sequencing data also supported the idea that the two moieties of icp-147 participate to the interaction with  xxxg2312xxx -dna covalent complexes. both hybrid compounds are more cytotoxic than etoposide but much less toxic than  xxxd168xxx  toward l1210 leukemia cells. in addition to its effect on  xxxg2312xxx , icp-114 can inhibit tubulin polymerization, whereas icp-147 is almost totally inactive in this assay. the unexpected capacity of icp-114 to interfere with the polymerization of tubulin suggests that this compound can target tubulin dimers, as it is the case with certain antitumor sulfonamides. the design of etoposide- xxxd168xxx  hybrids may thus represent an opportunity for the discovery of dual inhibitors that target both  xxxg2312xxx  and tubulin.
