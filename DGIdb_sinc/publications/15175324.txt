the effects of anesthetics that induce general anesthesia are
poorly understood. on the cellular level, the synaptic transmission of nerve impulses appears to be impaired by anesthetics
(1). the underlying molecular targets for this effect are still a
matter of debate. besides ion channels, which have been shown
to be modulated by anesthetics (2), other elements of signal
transduction such as receptors and g proteins may also be
involved in general anesthesia.

the family of g protein-activated inwardly rectifying k⫹
(girk)1 channels is comprised of at least five isoforms, designated  xxxg1252xxx -girk5 ( xxxg1252xxx –3.5) (3). there is strong evidence
that functional girk channels are homotetrameric or heterotetrameric complexes with the mammalian  xxxg1252xxx - xxxg1253xxx  isoforms
being differentially expressed primarily in the central nervous
system and cardiac tissue (4 – 6). functionally, girk channels
are activated by the binding of g␤␥ subunits to the intracellular
portions of the channel protein (7, 8). g␤␥ is released from heterotrimeric, inactive g␣␤␥ subunit complexes that have been
activated by the binding of an agonist to a g protein-coupled
receptor. on the cellular level, the opening of girk channels
stabilizes the membrane potential at ek⫹ and thus counteracts
membrane excitability. as a result, the activation of girk channels leads to a decrease in heart rate after the release of acetylcholine from the vagus nerve, and in the central nervous system
girk channels play an important role in the mediation of opioidand  xxxd102xxx induced analgesia (9 –12).
pharmacologically, girk channels are modulated by volatile
anesthetics (13). girk1f137s or  xxxg1252xxx  containing heteromeric
channels such as  xxxg1252xxx / xxxg1253xxx , but not homomeric  xxxg1253xxx 
channels, are activated by high concentrations of halothane in
the absence of an agonist (14). in contrast, low concentrations
of halothane are able to inhibit the agonist-induced currents
through girk channels when expressed in xenopus oocytes.
 xxxg1254xxx  channels are not activated by halothane at the basal
level but are most sensitive to the inhibitory action of halothane when activated by an agonist. these effects are independent from the receptor coexpressed and specific for the
girk channels (14). however, the mechanism of this dualistic
modulation of girk channels is not clear. the existence of at
least two independent mechanisms of halothane modulation of
girk channels had to be assumed. from our previous experiments (14) we concluded that halothane was able to activate
the  xxxg1252xxx  channel, probably by increasing its affinity to g␤␥,
and that the inhibition of agonist-activated girk channels was
because of the impairment of the g protein signaling cascade.
this is consistent with the findings of various other laboratories that demonstrate the inhibition of signaling through g␣i
by halothane (15–18).
structurally, girk channels consist of a core region with two
transmembrane domains (tm1 and tm2) with a reentrant
p-loop in between (fig. 1a, p). this core region is flanked by
n-and c-terminal regions, which constitute the “cytoplasmic
pore” as judged from crystal structure analysis (19, 20). this
structure is exposed to the cytoplasm and is believed to encom1

g protein-activated kⴙ channels (girks or kir3.x) are
targets for the volatile anesthetic, halothane. when coexpressed with the m2 acetylcholine (ach) receptor in xenopus oocytes, agonist-activated girk1f137s- and girk2mediated currents are inhibited by halothane, whereas in
the absence of ach, high concentrations of halothane induce girk1f137s-mediated currents. to elucidate the molecular mechanism of halothane action on girk currents
of different subunit compositions, we constructed deletion mutants of girk1f137s ( xxxg1252xxx ⌬363*) and  xxxg1254xxx 
( xxxg1254xxx ⌬356) lacking the c-terminal ends, as well as chimeric girk channels. mutated girk channels showed
normal currents when activated by ach but exhibited
different pharmacological properties toward halothane.
 xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 showed no sensitivity against the inhibitory
action of halothane but was activated by halothane in the
absence of an agonist.  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* was activated by halothane more efficiently. currents mediated by chimeric
channels were inhibited by anesthetic concentrations
that were at least 30-fold lower than those necessary to
decrease  xxxg1254xxx  wild type currents.  xxxg1073xxx  pulldown experiments did not show displacement
of bound g␤␥ by halothane, indicating that halothane
does not interfere with g␤␥ binding. single channel experiments revealed an influence of halothane on the gating of the channels: the agonist-induced currents of
 xxxg1252xxx  and  xxxg1254xxx , carried mainly by brief openings, were
inhibited, whereas higher concentrations of the anesthetic promoted long openings of  xxxg1252xxx  channels. because the c terminus is crucial for these effects, an interaction of halothane with the channel seems to be involved
in the mechanism of current modulation.

halothane sensitivity of girk channels
pass the g␤␥ binding sites (21–24). these parts of the proteins
show a high degree of homology between the different isoforms.
the most divergent regions are the distal n and c termini of
the protein. the long distal c terminus of  xxxg1252xxx  is unique
among the girk channels and shows virtually no homology to
the c termini of other girk channels. the role of the distal c
terminus is not clear, yet it is not thought to take part in
constitution of the cytoplasmic pore. rather, it protrudes into
the cytoplasm where it may function as an interaction domain
for other proteins or the channel itself.
to elucidate the mechanism of halothane action on girk
channels on the molecular level and to investigate the structural requirements for the modulation by halothane, we performed single channel experiments and used deletion mutants
of girk1f137s (the substitution of a serine for a phenylalanine
in  xxxg1252xxx  is necessary to get conductive homooligomeric
 xxxg1252xxx  channels; ref. 25) and  xxxg1254xxx  as well as chimeric proteins between these two channels. in addition, we tested
whether halothane interacts with the binding of g␤␥ to gst
fusion proteins, which comprise the putative g␤␥ binding sites
of the n- and c termini of  xxxg1252xxx .

evaporation of the anesthetic. the halothane solutions were prepared
from a saturated stock solution (17.8 mm) by dilution to the required
working concentrations. the actual concentration of the applied halothane solutions was analyzed in mock experiments by gas chromatography using an hp 5890gc (hewlett packard) device. concentrations
were found to be 0.96 ⫾ 0.03 mm for 1 mm halothane (n ⫽ 10), 312 ⫾ 13
␮m for 300 ␮m (n ⫽ 10), 97.2 ⫾ 7.8 ␮m for 100 ␮m halothane (n ⫽ 12),
and 29.1 ⫾ 7.3 ␮m for 30 ␮m (n ⫽ 3). in figures and text these concentrations are referred to as 1 mm, 300 ␮m, 100 ␮m, and 30 ␮m halothane.
whole cell currents were recorded with the two-electrode voltage
clamp technique using 3 m kcl filled glass electrodes (resistance of
0.8 –1.5 m⍀) and an axoclamp 2b amplifier (axon instruments). the
membrane potential was clamped constantly to ⫺70 mv, and the currents were measured first in nd96 solution (containing in mm: nacl
(96), kcl (2), mgcl2 (1), cacl2 (1), hepes (5) adjusted with naoh to
ph 7.5) and then in high k⫹ extracellular medium (hk: nacl (2), kcl
(96), mgcl2 (1), cacl2 (1), hepes (5) adjusted with koh to ph 7.5).
the agonist-induced current (iach) was evoked by superfusion with 10
␮m ach. the quantification of the effect of halothane was done 1 min
after the start of rinsing with the halothane-containing solution. control values for the halothane effect on iach were obtained by determining the current value 1 min after the peak current was reached during
rinsing with 10 ␮m ach without halothane. control values reflect the
current desensitization. current traces were digitized at 50 hz using an
axolab 1200 interface and were recorded with axotape (axon instruments) on an ibm-compatible computer. analysis of current recordings
was performed with the fetchan 6.0 software (axon instruments).
ic50 values were determined by least square fitting of the relative
inhibition of ach-induced currents to the following equation: %i ⫽
(100⫺y0)䡠([halo]h/([halo]h⫹ic50h))⫹y0 where %i is the percentage inhibition of iach, [halo] the concentration of halothane, h the hill coefficient, and y0 the control value.
for patch clamp experiments the vitelline membrane of oocytes was
removed with fine forceps after putting the cells in a hypertonic solution
(pg200ca, in mm: glutamate (180), kcl (37.5), cacl2 (1), mgcl2 (1),
hepes (10), ph 7.5). immediately after devitellinization the oocyte was
transferred to the recording chamber filled with 500 ␮l of bath solution
(bs, in mm: kcl (140), nacl (6), egta (1), mgcl2 (4), atp na2 (1),
hepes (10), koh to ph 7.5). patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass 1b150 (wpi), sylgard coated, fire polished, and back filled
with pipette solution (ps, in mm: kcl (144), nacl (2), mgcl2 (1), cacl2
(1), gdcl3 (1), hepes (10), koh to ph 7.5). the tip was filled with the
same solution without gdcl3. measurements were performed in the
cell-attached mode at a holding potential of ⫺80 mv with a heka
epc-9 amplifier and recorded with the pulse program (heka, germany) at a sampling rate of 15 khz and a filter frequency of 5 khz. the
basal channel activity was monitored for at least 5 min. from a saturated halothane stock solution 28 ␮l were directly applied to the bath to
obtain a concentration of 1 mm. the solution was mixed by gentle
pipetting. in mock experiments the loss of halothane because of evaporation was determined to be 23% within 5 min.
for analysis, the data were digitally filtered at 1.5 khz. the number
of channels in the patch was estimated from the overlaps of channel
openings during the course of an experiment. experiments with three
or fewer channels were analyzed. event detection was based on a 50%
criterion, and event tables were generated using the tac program
(bruxton). mean open times, open time histograms, and single channel
conductivity as well as open channel probability (po) were calculated
from these event tables. the relative open channel probability was
achieved by dividing po by the number of channels in the patch.
gst pulldown—gst fusion proteins that contained gst and the n
terminus of  xxxg1252xxx  (aa 1– 84, cd1) or the c terminus of  xxxg1252xxx  (aa
183–501, cd2) were created using pcr. dna fragments that encoded
the indicated amino acid residues from rat  xxxg1252xxx  were cloned into the
vector pgex-cs using the restriction enzymes bamhi and ncoi or xhoi,
respectively. all dna constructs were verified by nucleotide sequencing. gst䡠girk fusion proteins were expressed in bl21(de3) cells and
purified using glutathione affinity resin as described (30). the protein
was eluted from the resin with elution buffer (in mm: hepes (20), edta
(1), dithiothreitol (2), kcl (5), glutathione; ref. 15). if necessary, the
protein was concentrated and dialyzed overnight in elution buffer lacking glutathione. [35s]g␤1␥2 was synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (promega) and diluted 1:2. the fusion proteins (4 –7 ␮g/ml) were mixed with
5 ␮l of the diluted lysate and incubated for 2 h under gentle shaking in
700 ␮l of binding buffer (hepes/na, ph 7.4, (25), mgcl2 (5), egta (5),
tween 20 (0.05%)). the mixture was then incubated with glutathionesepharose beads for 30 min. the beads were recovered by filtering
through 0.45-␮m spin filters and washed three times with binding

materials and methods

oocyte culture—adult female xenopus laevis were anesthetized by
placing the frogs in 0.15% ms222 (ph 7.4). when narcosis was complete, the frogs were decapitated and ovaries were removed. oocytes
were prepared as described (26), and 50 nl of crna solutions were
injected (concentrations in ng/␮l given in parenthesis):  xxxg448xxx  (30),
girk1f137s (0.3),  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* (0.3),  xxxg1254xxx  wt (30),  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 (3) and
 xxxg1254xxx /1356 (0.25- 0.85),  xxxg1254xxx /1/2 (250),  xxxg1254xxx /1/2/1 (3). the expression of endogenous girk5 was suppressed by coinjection of 20 ng/␮l
antisense oligonucleotide (kha2) together with the crnas (27). incubation of oocytes was performed at 18 –20 °c for 5–9 days in nde
(containing in mm: nacl (96), kcl (2), mgcl2 (1), cacl2 (1.8), hepes
(5), pyruvate (2.5), and penicillin, 100 units/ml, streptomycin 100 ␮g/ml,
adjusted with naoh to ph 7.5).
preparation of crnas—plasmids were isolated from bacteria and
linearized using standard procedures (28). the following dnas were
used:  xxxg448xxx  (29), rat girk1f137s from atrium, and  xxxg1254xxx  wt
from mouse testis cloned into pbs-mxt. the truncated  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* (aa
1–363) and  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 (aa 1–356) channels were created by pcr via
primers containing the appropriate restriction sites ecorv/ecori and
clai/spei, respectively, as well as a stop codon at the end of each coding
region (lw5, 5⬘-cccgatatcatgtctgcactccgaagg-3⬘; lw6, 5⬘gcggaattcctattcttcctgctctttcacac-3⬘; lw1, 5⬘-cccatcgatatggaccaggatgtggaaagcc-3⬘; lw2, 5⬘-gcgactagtctactccgctagctctttggcac-3⬘). the introduced restriction sites
allowed the insertion of the amplified dna into pbsmxt, which is a
cloning vector designed to enable the synthesis of crna for injection
into x. laevis oocytes. the pcr products were cleaned by etoh precipitation prior to digestion with the respective enzymes. the dna was
further cleaned by gel extraction using the quiaex kit (quiagen). the
cleaned dna was ligated and transformed into xl-1-blue cells. for
the displacement of the c-terminal region of  xxxg1254xxx  by the homologous
area of  xxxg1252xxx , the same truncated  xxxg1254xxx  cdna as described above
was constructed except that there was no stop codon at the 3⬘-end (lw1;
lw2_1, 5⬘-gcgactagtctccgctagctctttggcact-3⬘). the additional pcr product created from the cytoplasmic loop of  xxxg1252xxx  was
cloned into the spei site of the  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 pbs-mxt plasmid. for exchange of the transmembrane domains of  xxxg1254xxx  and  xxxg1254xxx /1356 by
the homologous domain of girk1f137s (aa 88 –202), restriction sites for
aflii and ehei were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. the corresponding sequence of  xxxg1252xxx  was cloned into the restriction sites at
base positions 201 and 549 of  xxxg1254xxx  and  xxxg1254xxx /1356, respectively.
these chimeric channels were designated  xxxg1254xxx /1/2 and  xxxg1254xxx /1/2/1.
the correctness of the dna constructs was verified by automated
sequencing. the dnas were linearized with sali, and crna was synthesized with the ambion megascript kit (ambion, austin, tx).
electrophysiology—for two-electrode voltage clamp recordings, the
oocytes were placed in a chamber that allowed the superfusion of the
cells at 19 –21 °c. a virtual complete exchange of the bath solution
could be reached within 4 s, as judged by the changes in offset potentials. for halothane-containing solutions a gas tight superfusion system
was used that was made of glass syringes and teflon tubes to prevent

buffer. bound proteins were eluted with glutathione buffer (in mm:
glutathione (15), nacl (120), tween 20 (0.05%), tris (100), ph 8.0) and
analyzed on a 12% sds-polyacrylamide gel followed by coomassie blue
staining and autoradiography using phosphorimaging as described (31).
all steps of the procedure, except the gel electrophoresis, were performed in the presence of the respective concentrations of halothane.
the halothane concentration in the solutions was achieved by diluting
a saturated stock solution as described above. halothane-containing
wash solutions were prepared directly before use to minimize loss
caused by evaporation.
data presentation and statistics—experiments were repeated at
least twice, and results are given as mean ⫾ s.e. tests for statistical
significance were performed with the two-tailed student’s t test according to ref. 32 or performed with sigmaplot 6.0 (spss inc., erkrath,
germany). in the figures, levels of significance are given by asterisks: *,

results

current characteristics of mutated channels—the expression of girk channels led to an increase in the background or
basal currents when rinsed with hk solution (ihk) at a membrane potential of ⫺70 mv for all types tested. the application
of 10 ␮m acetylcholine evoked additional inward currents (iach)
when the m2 ach receptor was coexpressed. all girk constructs that we used (fig. 1a) showed normal activation and
desensitization properties when compared with girk wild
type channels. however, the current response to hk and ach
was higher through truncated channels when compared with
the respective wild type channels (fig. 1b). the average achinduced current in oocytes injected with 150 pg of  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356
crna was 2.8 ⫾ 0.4 ␮a (n ⫽ 11), whereas  xxxg1254xxx  wild type-

injected oocytes (1500 pg) reacted to ach with currents of only
0.7 ⫾ 0.2 ␮a. even with low amounts of injected crnas, both
the deletion mutant  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 and the chimera  xxxg1254xxx /1356
showed, on the average, higher currents than  xxxg1254xxx  wild type
channels. an increased ratio of iach/ihk from 3.3 to about 7.8
for the deletion mutant  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 and 8.1 for the chimera
 xxxg1254xxx /1356 was observed. the difference in currents was less
pronounced for girk1f137s and  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* channels; the
truncated channels showed an increase in the current amplitude by a factor of about 4.5 and no change in the current ratios
(fig. 1b) when the same amount of crna was injected. injection of oocytes with even high amounts of chimeric  xxxg1254xxx /1/2
rna gave only small girk currents and reduced the survival
rate of oocytes.
effect of halothane on currents through homooligomeric
wild type girk channels—as exemplified in fig. 2a, halothane was able to modulate the current through homooligomeric girk1f137s channels in xenopus oocytes, corroborating
our previous results (14). background currents were augmented by about 90% in the presence of 1 mm halothane, but
the current induced by 10 ␮m acetylcholine (iach) was inhibited
by low concentrations of halothane with maximum attenuation
of about 50% at a concentration of 100 ␮m halothane. when the
halothane concentration was increased, the effect reversed,
and rinsing the oocytes with 1 mm halothane led to an increase
in iach (14).

halothane is because of the disturbance of the binding of g␤␥ to

the channel, we performed pulldown experiments with
gst䡠girk1 fusion proteins. these fusion proteins contained
the n terminus (aa 1– 84, cd1) or the c-terminal part of the
channel (aa 183–501), thus including the putative g␤␥ binding
sites that are believed to be responsible for the agonist-induced
current activation (24). with cd1 the amount of pulled down
[35s]g␤␥ was not sufficient to perform a quantitative analysis.
with cd2 the amount of g␤␥ that was pulled down was less
than 10% of the total of labeled g␤␥ in the extract. halothane
(100 ␮m, n ⫽ 7; 300 ␮m, n ⫽ 6; and 1 mm, n ⫽ 5) did not change
the amount of bound g␤␥ (fig. 2, b and c), thus giving no
evidence for inhibition of g␤␥ binding to the channel by
halothane.
patch clamp experiments showed low basal activity of the
channels in the absence of an agonist with a relative open
probability of 4.0䡠10⫺3⫾ 1.2䡠10⫺3 (n ⫽ 5). however, the open
time distribution of detected events showed the existence of at

showed a time constant of 14.2 ⫾ 0.57 ms (␶2). halothane

a fraction of 7% to 44 ⫾ 15% without changing the time constants of the openings (n ⫽ 5). however, this shift led to an
increase in the mean open time by a factor of 3.6 (fig. 2f). in
addition the number of openings increased (fig. 2d), which led
to an increase in open probability by 852 ⫾ 368% (fig. 2g). the

open probability was increased more than 20-fold compared
with channels in the absence of ach (relative open channel

the agonist-induced activity of
girk1f137s channels. a, ach activated
girk channels by inducing short open
events. b, open time histogram of achevoked channel activity. c, halothane reduced the number of short events but promoted longer openings. d, open time

the open probability of activated girk
channels was reduced by halothane, although the mean open time was prolonged by halothane as shown in panel f.

(table i and fig. 3, c and d), resulting in an increase in mean
open time from 1.1 ⫾ 0.4 ms (n ⫽ 5) to 6.6 ⫾ 2.4 ms (n ⫽ 4, p ⬍
0.05).
 xxxg1254xxx  wt channels have been shown to be most sensitive to
the inhibitory action of halothane; activation of the basal current was never observed (13, 14). concentrations of more than
100 ␮m halothane significantly reduced the current (fig. 4a).
in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments, the least square
fitting of normalized current values to the hill equation yielded
a half-maximum effect of 143 ␮m halothane on ach-induced
currents and a hill coefficient of 1.3. in one of three single
channel experiments, 1 mm halothane completely blocked channel openings induced by 50 nm ach. in two more experiments
the number of events was reduced to an extent that prevented

meaningful statistical analysis. the open channel probability
was reduced to 6.5 ⫾ 4.2% of control (n ⫽ 3, fig. 4c).
effects of halothane on deletion mutants of girk channels—because  xxxg1252xxx  and  xxxg1254xxx  channels reacted differently
to halothane, we constructed deletion mutants that lacked the
unique c terminus of  xxxg1252xxx  and the corresponding c terminus
of  xxxg1254xxx  to investigate whether the respective pharmacological properties reside on the channel itself.
the halothane-induced activation of background currents
that were mediated by truncated  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* channels was
more pronounced than with girk1f137s currents (fig. 5, a and
b). the background currents of  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* were activated by
514 ⫾ 75% (n ⫽ 21, p ⬍ 0.001) with 1 mm halothane. lower
concentrations were less effective, but still 300 ␮m halothane

ant against halothane inhibition. no reduction of the agonistinduced current was observed by halothane in concentrations
of 10 ␮m-1 mm when compared with control values (fig. 6, c
and d).
as expected, patch clamp experiments showed no influence
of halothane on ach-evoked channel activity. the single channel conductivity was 30.0 ⫾ 1.0 picosiemens and therefore
higher compared with the  xxxg1254xxx  wild type channel with
21.7 ⫾ 3.9 picosiemens. both channel types showed frequent
openings that obviously did not reach the full open level (figs.
4b and 6e). the open time characteristic of both channel types
was also very similar. although both channel types showed
long and short open times, the difference between both was not
as pronounced as was the case for  xxxg1252xxx  channels. the time
constant for longer open events was 2.6 ⫾ 0.3 ms, and it
counted for 41 ⫾ 10% of the opening events of the channel.
halothane did not change the open time constants or influence
the distribution of long and short events. the open probability
and single channel conductivity remained unchanged by halothane. we failed to detect significant changes in single channel
behavior in the absence of ach. a small increase in the channel
open probability was observed because of a slight increase in
mean open time and in the number of opening events (data not
shown).
effect of halothane on chimeric girk channels—to further
investigate the role of the girk c terminus in halothaneinduced channel modulation, we transferred the unique  xxxg1252xxx 
c terminus to the  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 channel. the sensitivity of the
chimera against halothane was increased ⬃25-fold when compared with  xxxg1254xxx  wt channels. iach through  xxxg1254xxx /1356
channels was nearly completely inhibited by 100 ␮m halothane
(fig. 7, a and b), and the ic50 value was found to be 5.5 ␮m
halothane with a hill coefficient of 0.7. in contrast to
girk1f137s or  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 channels, the basal current of the
chimera was inhibited instead of being activated by halothane

induced 104 ⫾ 14% (n ⫽ 17, p ⬍ 0.001) augmentation of the
current, a value reached with girk1f137s-mediated currents
only at concentrations of more than 1 mm.
the agonist-induced currents of  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* were similarly
sensitive to inhibition by halothane when compared with
girk1f137s channels. the inhibition was most pronounced at
30 ␮m halothane with a decrease in the current of 59 ⫾ 3% (n ⫽
4, p ⬍ 0.001) and less at higher concentrations of the anesthetic, where activation of the channel obviously overrides the
inhibition (see fig. 5a, application of 1 mm halothane, and 5c).
single channel experiments of the halothane effect on
 xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* yielded similar results compared with girk1f137s
channels. the basal current was stimulated by 1 mm halothane
because of an increase in the number of channel openings and
open time (data not shown). the ach-induced current was
mainly carried by brief channel openings. only 14 ⫾ 10% of the
opening events were characterized by a long time constant of
10.5 ⫾ 2.7 ms (n ⫽ 7) (fig. 5, d and e and table i). the single
channel conductivity was determined to be 14.5 ⫾ 0.18 picosiemens and, therefore, the same as for girk1f137s channels. as
expected from the two-electrode voltage clamp experiments,
halothane at a concentration of 1 mm had no effect on the open
probability of ach-activated  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* channels, but similar
to girk1f137s channels, it propagated channel openings with
longer open times (table i and fig. 5, f and g).
wild type  xxxg1254xxx  channels never responded to halothane
with activation. the truncation of the c terminus of  xxxg1254xxx  at
aa 356 ( xxxg1254xxx ⌬356) resulted in a channel protein that was
activated by halothane in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments. concentrations as low as 100 ␮m halothane induced an
increase in basal currents (fig. 6, a and b). higher concentrations of halothane were more effective, and 1 mm of the anesthetic augmented the background current by 178 ⫾ 39% (n ⫽
16, p ⬍ 0.001). in contrast to the wild type  xxxg1254xxx  channels,
iach mediated by truncated  xxxg1254xxx ⌬356 channels proved resist-

(data not shown). halothane at concentrations of 300 ␮m and 1
mm reduced ihk by 34 ⫾ 13% (n ⫽ 3) and 71 ⫾ 7% (n ⫽ 3, p ⬍
0.05), respectively.
because of the lipophilic nature of halothane, the site of
interaction with integral membrane proteins might lie within
the transmembrane-spanning regions of the channel (33). we
sought to test whether the halothane-induced activation of
 xxxg1252xxx  channels is a property that can be traced to a structure
within these transmembrane domains or the pore region of the
channel. therefore, we substituted the region between aa 88
and aa 202 of the  xxxg1254xxx  channel and the  xxxg1254xxx /1356 channel
for the homologous region of girk1f137s. this part of the
channel comprises the transmembrane and the pore-forming
domains of the channel. both chimeras showed a clear increase
in sensitivity against the inhibitory action of halothane (fig. 7,
c and e). in neither case was activation of girk currents
observed with halothane. the agonist-induced current iach
was inhibited at an estimated ic50 value of 10 ␮m halothane for
 xxxg1254xxx /1/2 (fig. 7d) and 300 nm halothane for  xxxg1254xxx /1/2/1

analysis of the open times showed a shift
to longer duration.

(fig. 7f). in the case of  xxxg1254xxx /1/2/1-mediated currents, 10 ␮m
halothane was sufficient to completely abolish iach, and higher
concentrations diminished the current value beneath basal
values.
it has been postulated that halothane increases the affinity
between g␣i and g␤␥ (16). thus, the inhibition of activated
girk channels by halothane might be the result of a shift in
the equilibrium distribution of g␤␥ from the effector (the activated channel) to the g protein ␣ subunit. if this is the case, the
rate of current decay because of halothane inhibition should be
comparable with the rate of current decay because of the deactivation by the wash out of the agonist. however, the time
course of halothane-induced inhibition of iach was rapid compared with the decrease of the agonist-induced current due to
the wash out of ach. fitting of the current decays to a single
exponential equation gave time constants for the inhibition by
100 ␮m halothane of 3.0 ⫾ 0.6 s (n ⫽ 6) and a time constant for
the deactivation of ach-induced currents of 19.0 ⫾ 2.5 s (n ⫽ 6)

othane is thus about 6-fold more rapid than the deactivation of
the current due to deprivation of the agonist.
discussion

from our previous work (14) it was not clear how halothane
was able to inhibit agonist-activated girk currents with high
potency but activate the background current with lower potency. a mechanism with two independent targets seemed
most probable. an increase in g␤␥ affinity to the channel could
have explained the activation by halothane, whereas disruption of the g protein-signaling cascade downstream of the
receptor could have been a reason for the inhibition of agonistinduced currents. however, in light of our new findings, the
existence of two such independent mechanisms for modulation
of girk currents by halothane, i.e. one on the g protein and
the other on the channel, seems unlikely. the inhibition of open
channels by halothane cannot be assigned to the inhibition of
the g protein, because it can be abolished by deletion of the c
terminus of the channel and therefore has to be a property of
the channel itself. halothane does not physically block the

pore, but it seems to interact with the gating mechanism of the
channel. obviously there are at least two gates that are affected: a fast one is inhibited; it promotes flickering like channel openings due to the activation of the g-protein, whereas
another slow one is responsible for longer openings and can be
activated by halothane.
in the absence of an agonist, halothane induced activity of
girk1f137s and  xxxg1252xxx ⌬363* channels. the number of opening
events and the duration of the openings was increased (figs. 2,
d and f, and 5f). an increase in the number of long events was
also seen when halothane was applied to channels that had
been activated by ach. in addition, halothane decreased the
number of short openings in the presence of the agonist (fig.
3c), thus explaining how the anesthetic was able to reduce the
agonist-induced current but activate the background current.
the fact that the sensitivity of girk channels to halothane
was determined by the c terminus indicates that this part of
the protein interacts with the g␤␥ binding sites or directly
modulates the gating of the channel. deleting this part of the

halothane sensitivity of girk channels

channel abolished the halothane sensitivity of  xxxg1254xxx  channels
(fig. 6c). on the other hand, introduction of the c terminus of
 xxxg1252xxx  into girk 2 further increased its sensitivity against
halothane (fig. 7a). the functional role of the c terminus in
girk channels is still not clear. although crystallography
studies revealed the three-dimensional structure of inwardly
rectifying k⫹ channels (19, 20, 34), the distal c terminus downstream residue 371 could not be incorporated into the threedimensional structure. however, it is assumed that this part of
the molecule is not part of the cytoplasmic pore but protrudes
into the cytoplasm and probably mediates protein-protein interactions. from functional studies we know that the c terminus of  xxxg1252xxx  may physically block the channel because treatment with trypsin from the cytosolic side activates girk in a
manner similar to ach (35). the coexpression of the c-terminal
tail of  xxxg1252xxx  effectively inhibits channel activity in xenopus
oocytes (36); furthermore, a peptide of 20 amino acid residues
derived from the very c-terminal end of  xxxg1252xxx  is a potent and
reversible blocker of girk channels (37). interestingly, the

developed increased sensitivities
against halothane. a, the time course of
 xxxg1254xxx /1356-mediated currents measured
with the two-electrode voltage clamp
technique. b, agonist-induced currents
were effectively inhibited by halothane.
sensitivity against halothane was increased about 30-fold in the chimeric
channel when compared with  xxxg1254xxx 
channels, the most sensitive of the wild
type channels. c,  xxxg1254xxx /1/2 channels
were also inhibited by low concentrations
of halothane. d, the ic50 value was estimated to be about 10 ␮m, 15 times less
than for the  xxxg1254xxx  wt channel. e, exchange of the c terminus of  xxxg1254xxx /1/2
against that of  xxxg1252xxx  yielded the  xxxg1254xxx /
1/2/1 channel. the current mediated by
this channel showed further increased
sensitivity against halothane. a concentration of 300 nm halothane was sufficient
to reduce the current by about 50% as
shown in panel f.

deletion mutants of  xxxg1252xxx  as well as  xxxg1254xxx  lacking the cterminal end that we used in this study did not show any
obvious gating abnormalities. this would be expected, if this
very part of the c terminus directly took part in the binding of
g␤␥ and gating of the channel. the c-terminal deletion mutants were readily activated by ach via the coexpressed m2
receptors and deactivated rapidly after washout of the agonist.
the only difference seen was a general higher level of currents
in oocytes injected with the crna of the deletion mutants (fig.
1b). however, in patch clamp experiments we did not observe
a general higher open probability of single mutated channels.
in vitro synthesized, metabolically labeled g␤␥ has been
successfully used in the past to identify specific g␤␥-binding
sites of girk channels (24) or voltage-dependent ca2⫹ channels (31). our experiments showed no displacement of bound
g␤␥ to the gst䡠girk1 fusion protein in concentrations of up to
1 mm halothane. the fusion proteins were incubated in a solution with saturating g␤␥ concentrations (about 10-fold excess);
thus, with this method it is not possible to detect a potential

halothane sensitivity of girk channels

increase in g␤␥ affinity to the channel protein. in contrast, a
potential decrease in g␤␥ affinity would have been detected
because the bound complexes were washed with halothanecontaining solutions in the absence of g␤␥. any decrease in
affinity because of halothane would have reduced the amount
of bound g␤␥. even if we take into account that there is more
than one binding site for g␤␥ in the c terminus of  xxxg1252xxx  that
could obscure a possible halothane-induced shift of binding
from one site to another, it seems unlikely that washing the
complexes in the absence of free g␤␥ would not reduce the total
amount of bound protein. therefore, we conclude that halothane does not interrupt the g protein-signaling on the level of
g␤␥ binding to the channel.
the c terminus of girk, which plays a crucial role in mediating the anesthetic effect of halothane, is rather hydrophilic
and therefore thought to protrude into the cytoplasm (19).
judged from this property one would not expect strong interaction of hydrophobic substances like halothane with the c
terminus of girk channels directly. however, it is impossible
to predict binding of anesthetics to proteins from the amino
acid sequence alone (38). our findings show a strong dependence of the halothane action on the c terminus of the girk
channel, and therefore a direct interaction of halothane with
this part of the protein seems possible. still, other mechanisms,
such as so-far unknown interactions with other proteins mediated by the c terminus, may play a role in the observed halothane effects.

34249
