electrophysiologic effects of  xxxd236xxx  metabolites. introduction: the selective
hj-receptor antagonist  xxxd236xxx  ( xxxd236xxx ) causes acquired long qt syndrome.  xxxd236xxx 
blocks the rapidly activating delayed rectifier k"^ current ii;^ ^"d ^he human ether-a go-gorelated gene (hkrg) k"^ channels that underlie it.  xxxd236xxx  also is rapidly metaholized. the
principal metaholite is desmethylastemizole, which retains h,-receptor antagonist properties,
has a long elimination time of 9 to 13 days, and its steady-state serum concentration exceeds that
of  xxxd236xxx  hy more than 30-fold. a second metaholite is norastemizole, which appears in
serum in low concentrations following  xxxd236xxx  ingestion and has undergone development as
a new antihistamine drug. our objective in the present work was to study the effects of
desmethylastemizole, norastemizole, and  xxxd236xxx  on  xxxg1246xxx  k'*' channels.
methods and results:  xxxg1246xxx  channels were expre.ssed in a mammalian (hek 293) cell line
and studied using the patch clamp technique. desmethylastemizole and  xxxd236xxx  blocked
hkrg current with similar concentration dependence (half-maximal hlock of 1.0 and 0.9 nm,
respectively) and hlock was use dependent. norastemizole also blocked  xxxg1246xxx  current;
however, hlock was incomplete and required higher drug concentrations (half-maximal block
of 27.7 nm).
conclusions: desmethylastemizole and  xxxd236xxx  cause equipotent hlock of  xxxg1246xxx  channels,
and these are among the most potent  xxxg1246xxx  channel antagonists yet studied. because desmethylastemizole becomes the dominant compound in .serum, these findings support the postulate
that it becomes the principal cause of long qt syndrome ohserved in patients following
 xxxd236xxx  ingestion. norastemizole block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels is weaker; thus, the risk of
producing ventricular arrhythmias may he lower. these findings underscore the potential roles
of some h|-receptor antagonist metabolites as k"^ channel antagonists. (j cardiovasc electrophy.uou vol. jo, pp. 836-843, june 1999)

 xxxd236xxx  ( xxxd236xxx ) is a second-generation
selective h,-receptor antagonist. in addition to
antihistamine effects, it causes qt interval prolongatioti, cardiac arrhythmias including torsades
de pointes, and suddeti death.' in mammals, including humans,  xxxd236xxx  appears in serum
only briefly (elimination time — 1,1 days) because it undergoes rapid biotransformations by
the hepatic cytochrome p450 enzyme system.^••'
the principal metabolite is desmethylastemizole.

zttou. et at. electrophysiologic effects of  xxxd236xxx  metabolites
which is generated by oxidative o-demethylation
of the parent drug. it retains antihistamine properties, has a long elimination time of 9 to 13
days, and its steady-state serum concentration
exceeds that of  xxxd236xxx  by more than 30-foid.
a second metabolite is norastemizole, which is
generated by oxidative a'-dealkylation of the parent drug, and it appears in the serum in low
concentrations following  xxxd236xxx  ingestion.
norastemizole is reported to have h,-receptor
antagonist properties more potent than desmethylastemizole and  xxxd236xxx ,'*"^ and it has undergone development as a new antihistamine drug.**
 xxxd236xxx  has been widely studied and is
known to block cardiac potassium (k"^) channels, specifically the rapidly activating delayed
rectifier k^ channel current i^./ and the human
ether-a go-go-related gene ( xxxg1246xxx ) k^ channels
that underlie it.** " block of i^^ has been postulated to be the mechanistn underlying  xxxd236xxx -induced action potential and qt interval
prolongation, and the induction of early afterdepolarizations (eads) and cardiac arrhythmias.^'^'^ desmetbylastemizole also has been
shown to block 1^, in rabbit myocytes and to
cause action potential prolongation and the induction of eads. thus, it is an electrophysiologically active metabolite that also may cause
long qt syndrome.'"^ norastemizole. in contrast,
has been thought to not block signilicantly
i^ir'^"" or cause long qt syndrome.^•'''•'**
our objective in the present work was to study
the effects of desmethylastemizole, norastemizole, and  xxxd236xxx  on hbrg k"^ channe! current studied in a heterologous expression system.
we examined the mechanism of  xxxg1246xxx  channel
block by desmethyiastemizole and we determined the concentration-dependence relations
for these three antihistamine cotnpounds. portions of this work have appeared in preliminary
form. i-^
methods
stable transfection of hek 293 cells

the stable transfection of hek 293 cells with
 xxxg1246xxx  was reported previously.^o briefly,  xxxg1246xxx 
cdna was subcloned into the pcdna3 vector
(lnvitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa). hek 293 cells
were transfected with this construct using the
lipofectamine method (gibco brl, gaithersburg, md, usa). after selection in 800 /xg/ml

837

 xxxd2191xxx  (g4i8; gibco) for 15 to 20 days, single
colonies were picked with cloning cylinders and
tested for  xxxg1246xxx  current. the stably transfected
cells were cultured in minimal essential medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
400 jltg/ml  xxxg418xxx . for electrophysiologic study,
the cells were harvested from the culture dish by
trypsinization, washed twice with standard minimal essential medium, and stored in this medium at room temperature for later use. cells
were studied within 8 hours of harvest.

patch clamp recording method

cells used for electrophysiologic study were
transferred to a small, heated cell bath mounted
on the stage of an inverted microscope (diaphot;
nikon, tokyo, japan). they were superfused
with hepes-buffered tyrode's solution containing (in mm): nacl 137, kc!4,cacl2 1.8, mgcla
1, glucose 10, and hepes 10 (ph 7.4 with
naoh). solution exchanges in the experimental
chamber were completed witbin 2 minutes.
membrane currents were recorded in a whole
cell configuration using suction pipettes.^"-^' the
intemal pipette solution contained (in mm): kcl
130, mgcl2 i, egta 5, mgatp 5, and hepes
10 (ph 7.2 with koh). an axopatch-id patch
clamp amplifier (axon instrutnents, foster city,
ca, usa) was used to record membrane currents. computer software (pclamp, version
6.02, axon instruments) was used to generate
voltage clamp protocols, acquire data, and analyze current signals. all experiments were performed at 35° ± r c .

drugs and chemicals

desmethylastemizole, norastemizole, and
 xxxd236xxx  (drug purity > 99.8%) were obtained
from research diagnostics inc. (flanders, nj,
usa). eacb drug was dissolved in  xxxd102xxx  to give a stock concentration of 10 mm.
final drug concentrations were made by diluting
stock solution with extracellular hepes-buffered tyrode's solution. ethanol control (n = 3
cells), at a concentration (0.01%) equivalent to
the highest drug dilution studied, had no effect
on  xxxg1246xxx  current. other chemicals were purchased from sigma chemical co. (st. louis,
mo, usa).

of drug block in the presence of 3 nm desmethylastemizole. the initial current amplitude with
the first depolarizing step following drug wasbin
was virtually unchanged compared with tbe control current, indicating minimal closed state
block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels. the outward current
amplitude then gradually declined during the depolarizing step, and it declined further with the
application of subsequent depolarizing steps as
drug block accumulated. a steady-state level of
block was reached by approximately the tenth
depolarizing step. in tbis experiment, tail current
peak amplitude was decreased from a control
value of 355 to 92 pa following the tentb depolarizing step. figure 2b sbows  xxxg1246xxx  current
recorded from a different cell exposed to 30 nm
desmethylastemizole. results were similar to
those described earlier, except that drug block
with the first depolarizing step developed more
rapidly and tbe depth of block was greater, and
with the application of repetitive depolarizing
steps drug block accumulated to reach a steady
state by the end of the second depolarizing step.
in this cell, 30 nm desmetbylastemizole decreased tail current peak amplitude from 518 to 5
pa following the fourth depolarizing step. the
findings shown in figures 2a and 2b indicate
that the development of drug block required cell
depolarization to activate  xxxg1246xxx  channels and
suggest that drug binding occurs pritnarily to
activated channels in the open or inactivated
states. these results also show that recovery
from drug block during repolarization to the
holding potential was minimal.
block of hbrg current by desinethylastemizole was partially reversed with prolonged drug
washout (fig. 2c). after recording the control
current trace (peak tail current 950 pa), steadystate block of tbe  xxxg1246xxx  current witb 30 nm
desmetbylastemizole was established (peak tail
current 61 pa). drug wasbout for 20 minutes
resulted in partial recovery of  xxxg1246xxx  current to a
peak tail current of 539 pa. additional recovery
was not obtained with drug wasbout periods to
30 minutes. similar results were obtained in
three cells.

protocol is shown above the current traces. the
sensitivity of  xxxg1246xxx  channels to block with desmethylastemizole and  xxxd236xxx  was comparable, and the development of drug block followed
similar time courses. for desmethylastemizole (1
nm). the average tail current peak amplitude was
reduced from 695 ± 105 to 353 ± 38 pa (48%
decrease, n = 4 cells; p < 0.05). for  xxxd236xxx 
(1 nm). the average tail current peak amplitude
was reduced from 807 ± 171 to 374 ±. 94 pa

(55% decrease, n = 4 cells; p < 0.05). thus,
desmethylastemizole and  xxxd236xxx  reduced
 xxxg1246xxx  current comparably under these experimental conditions. the effect of 100 nm norastemizole is shown in figure 3c. norastemizole reduced tail current peak amplitude from a
control value of 891 ± 130 to 506 ± 63 pa (43%
decrease, n = 3 cells; p < 0.05). the development of drug block required channel activation
(data not shown).

and m is drug concentration.-^ using this approach gave an ic5q value of 27.7 nm for the
drug-sensitive component and a maximum block
of  xxxg1246xxx  current of 48%. the mechanism of
norastemizole's incomplete block of  xxxg1246xxx 
channels is uncertain, although similar incomplete block of  xxxg1246xxx  current has heen shown
with the antihistamine ebastine.-^
discussion
the present experiments demonstrate that desmethylastemizole, norastemizole. and  xxxd236xxx 
hlock  xxxg1246xxx  channels heterologously expressed
in hek 293 cells, and these are the first experiments to directly compare the concentration dependence of  xxxg1246xxx  channel block by these drugs
and drug metabolites. for desmethylastemizole
and  xxxd236xxx . equipotent block of  xxxg1246xxx  current was found. moreover, the sensitivity of
 xxxg1246xxx  channels to block by desmethylastemizole and  xxxd236xxx  exceeds that reported for
other i^r-hlocking drugs including the developmental class iii antiarrhythmic compounds
e-4()31 (ic30 of 7.7 nm2") and dofetilide (ic<;,, of
12 nm--*). and the gastrointestinal prokinetic
agent  xxxd1708xxx  (ic50 of 6.5 nm-^). which have
been studied in the hek 293 cell expression
system under conditions of steady-state hlock
and cause acquired long qt syndrome in humans. we conclude that desmethylastemizole
and  xxxd236xxx  are among the most potent  xxxg1246xxx 
channel-blocking drugs yet studied, whereas norastemizole block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels is weaker.
our findings with  xxxd236xxx  agree with previous work in native heart cells by salata et al.,'
who showed tbat  xxxd236xxx  blocked i^^ witb an
ic5q of 1.5 nm. our results are different from

841

those obtained in oocyte expression systems
where the ic<;,, for  xxxg1246xxx  current block with
 xxxd236xxx  is 48 nm.** the differences between
these ic50 values reported for oocytes versus
cultured mammalian cells or for i^^, in native
heart cells has heen found with other drugs that
hlock  xxxg1246xxx  channels and may be attributed to
experimental technique and protocol differences,
and to the effects of restricted drug diffusion at
the surface membrane and yolk sac absorption in
oocytes (see references 20 and 24 for discussion). ic5q values for block of i^r or  xxxg1246xxx 
current have not been previously reported for
desmethylastemizole or norastemizole.
desmethylastemizole and norastemizole

drug block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels by desmethylastemizole was use dependent. drug binding to
the closed state was minimal, as nearly nonnal
peak current was recorded with the first depolarizing step after drug washin (fig. 2). we obtained similar results with norastemizole and
 xxxd236xxx  block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels, which, in
part, confirms previous reports of use-dependent
block by  xxxd236xxx .** drug unbinding between
voltage steps was minimal, as previously found
with methanesulfonanilide antiarrhythmic drugs
e-4031 and dofetilide.^"-^
the present findings support our previous observation tbat desmethylastemizole blocks i^r in
rabbit ventricular cells.'-* in those experiments,
we showed that desmethylastemizole (20 nm)
caused action potential prolongation, induced
eads arising from plateau voltages, and suppressed i^^j. by > 50%, although the ic-^,, was not
determined. because in humans the steady-state
serum level of desmethylastemizole exceeds that
of  xxxd236xxx  by more than 30-fold.- our present
findings showing equipotent block of  xxxg1246xxx 
channels by these compounds support the postulate that qt interval prolongation and torsades
de pointes found with  xxxd236xxx  intake primarily may be caused by the  xxxg1246xxx  channel-blocking properties of the desmethylastemizole metabolite.
our findings show that norastemizole retains
electrophysiologic activity, and this is the first
report of this effect. drug block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels, however, required higher drug concentrations and it was incomplete, with  xxxg1246xxx  current
reduced by a maximum of about 50%. siinilar
incomplete block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels was found
with the antihistamine ebastine.^' norastemizole

has undergone development as an antihistamine
drug, and initial clinical reports suggest that it
has little or no effect on the qt interval,''•'^•"* it
bas antihistamine properties at least 20-fold more
potent than  xxxd236xxx ,-*^ and plasma concentrations reported to produce antihistamine effects in
normal volunteers-*^ are less than those we found
necessary for block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels in our
experiments. thus, for norastemizole compared
with  xxxd236xxx , the present findings support a
greater safety margin for block of h,-receptors
versus  xxxg1246xxx  channels. however, because norastemizole is not free of  xxxg1246xxx  block properties,
the potential for qt interval prolongation could
exist at high drug concentrations, and further
evaluation seems warranted.
finally, our results may have structure-activity implications for drug binding of h,-receptor
antagonists to  xxxg1246xxx  channels. chemical structure-activity requirements considered to be important for block of i^r include the presence of a
tertiary amine, a para-substituted phenyl group,
and a linking chain attaching these groups.-'' for
h[-receptor antagonist molecules, it has been
suggested that the lipophilicity and the length
(bulkiness) of the linking chain confer important
 xxxg1246xxx  channel-blocking properties.'^"'-*' as
shown in figure 5, both desmethylastemizole
and  xxxd236xxx  contain a lipophilic. para-substituted phenyl ring attached to a tertiary amine via
a linking side chain, whereas tbe oxidative a'dealkylation metabolism step that generates norastemizole removes the linking side chain along
with the phenyl group attached to it. the finding
tbat norastemizole retains  xxxg1246xxx -blocking prop-

dm-ast

nor-ast

erties, but with reduced affinity, supports the
postulate that the linking side chain and attached
phenyl group are important structural determinants of  xxxg1246xxx  block, ft is interesting that the
norastemizole molecule contains a second tertiary amine attached via a single carbon to a
para-substituted fluoro-phenyl group. tbis site
also fulfills postulated structure-activity requirements for k^ channel block,-'' and this structure
potentially could contribute to the reduced affinity  xxxg1246xxx  block found with norastemizole.
comparison with the antihistamine terfenadine
it is important to compare our results to previous
findings with the h,-selective antagonist terfenadine (seldane), a dmg recently withdrawn from the
u.s. marketplace because of potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias.^^ terfenadine causes action potential prolongation and eads in native heart cells,
and qt interval prolongation and arrhythmias including torsades de pointes in humans (for review
see references 7. 12, and 28). it blocks i^^,. in native
hean cells and  xxxg1246xxx  current studied in heterologous expression systems,''"^-^'*-^'^ although terfenadine's affinity for block of  xxxg1246xxx  channels is less
than that of  xxxd236xxx  or desmethylastemizole.'**-^^ tbe principal metabolite of terfenadine,
terfenadine carboxylate (fexofenadine), which retains antihistamine properties, is inactive against
1^^28.30 and  xxxg1246xxx  channels,^^ and it has been
shown to not cause action potential prolongation,
eads, qt interval lengthening, and arrhythmias,'^
thus, for tertenadine, cardiotoxicity is caused
solely by the parent drug, whereas for  xxxd236xxx 
cardiotoxicity is primarily caused by a metabolite
witb potent  xxxg1246xxx -blocking properties and a long
elimination time.

channels. the concentration-dependence relations for  xxxg1246xxx  current block show that  xxxd236xxx  is equipotent with desmethyiastemizole,
whereas norastemizole blocks  xxxg1246xxx  current
more weakly. these findings, combined with the
drug metabolism of  xxxd236xxx , support the postulate that desmethylastemizole may play the
principal role in qt interval prolongation and
torsades de pointes observed in patients following a.stemizole intake. norastemizole. which is a
developmental antihistamine drug, requires fur-
