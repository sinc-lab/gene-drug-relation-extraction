in m6nihre’s disease, an inner ear disorder related
to an endolymphatic hydrops, an alteration of the functioning of the endolymphatic sac has been proposed.
the endolymphatic sac is assumed to be involved in
the secretionhesorption of endolymph. the epithelial
transport s y s e s have been indirectly studied by the
recording of the endolymphatic sac transepithelial potential (esp) in control conditions and after the local
injection of drugs such as diuretics that have been proposed in the treatment of m6nihre’s disease. the esp
was recorded, in vivo, in guinea pigs up to 150 minutes
after the perisaccular injection of 5 p l of a 150 mmovl
(mm) nacl solution containing various drugs known to
inhibit ionic transport systems. the initial esp was
+8.4 2 0.3 mv (mean 2 sem, n = 78). the basolateral injection of 5 @ of 150 mm nacl induced an esp decrease of 64% 2 6.0% (n = 12),5 minutes after the end of
the injection. then esp increased, returning to its initial value at 60 minutes and surpassing it at 120 minutes. diuretics such as acetazolamide
mom [mi),
an inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, and amiloride
mi, an inhibitor of na channel or na/h exchanger, decreased the esp recovery. at variance, bumetanide

control group. ouabain

introduction
the inner ear fluids, endolymph and perilymph, are
essential to the transmission of mechanical stimuli to the
cochlear and vestibular organs and to the mechanoelectrical transduction processes that take place in the sensory
organs. the two fluids differ dramatically in composition:
cochlear endolymph is a k-rich fluid, almost devoid of na
(1to 2 mm), and positively polarized, whereas perilymph
has the composition of an extracellular fluid. endolymph
originates from perilymph and is produced by the secretory epithelia of the cochlea and vestibule. cochlear endolymph is partly reabsorbed locally through reissner’s
membrane (radial flow of endolymph), while another part
follows a longitudinal flow that drives it to the endolymphatic sac where it is reabsorbed (for review see sterkers
et al.1). in the endolymphatic sac, the composition of the
luminal fluid differs from that in the cochlea: the k concentration is lower (15 mm), the na concentration higher
but less than in perilymph (100 mm), and the endolymphatic sac transepithelial potential (esp) remains positive to perilymph (+lo to 15 mv1.z
an increase of the volume of the endolymphatic compartment, called endolymphatic hydrops, is the most frequent histologic lesion observed in meniere’s disease, an inner ear disorder inducing crisis of vertigo, sensorineural
hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness. endolymphatic
hydrops could result from an increase of secretion andor a
decrease of the reabsorption of endolymph. two arguments
suggest a lack of reabsorption of endolymph by the endolymphatic sac: histologic lesions of the endolymphatic sac
have been described in cases of mbniere’s disease, and it
has been possible to experimentally induce an endolymphatic hydrops in animals after the destruction of the endolymphatic duct and sac3 or after the antigenic stimulation of the endolymphatic sac.4
the association of endolymphatic hydrops and
mbnibre’s disease led physicians to believe that diuretics
couloigner et al.: endolymphatic sac

could treat meniere’s disease. the decrease of the systemic
fluid volume by diuretics may induce an osmotic shift of extracellular fluid from endolymph into perilymph and
blood.5 as a matter of fact, the administration of osmotic
agents such as glycerol can induce a temporary hearing improvement that constitutes a diagnostic test in mbniere’s
disease. clinical trials showed a certain efficiency of diuretics and salt restriction in meniere’s disease.6 anyhow,
because the mechanisms of ionic and fluid transports in inner ear, especially in the endolymphatic sac, and the nature
and localization of inner ear lesions in mbnibre’s disease
are still poorly known, only a few trials have studied the
specific effects of the different families of diuretics in this
disease. one of the most frequently studied diuretics has
been acetazolamide, a diuretic that inhibits carbonic anhydrase. indeed, carbonic anhydrase is known t o be present in
the endolymphatic sac,7 on the one hand, and acetazolamide has been shown to be efficient in diseases with excess of fluid secretion, such as glaucoma* or intracranial hypertension,g on the other. in clinical trials on mbniere’s
disease, contradictory results concerning the effect of acetazolamide have been reported (for review see shinkawa
and kimuralo). further clinical studies of diuretic treatments in mbniere’s disease should be based on a better
knowledge of the potential inner ear targets of diuretics
and of the lesions responsible for meniere’s disease.
in this study, we chose to observe the effects of ion
transports inhibitors, especially diuretics, applied on the
basolateral side of the endolymphatic sac, by means of the
measurement of the esp. the results demonstrate that
the esp was mainly altered by drugs acting on acid-base
transport systems. the possible effects of these drugs in
the occurrence of hydrops remains to be studied.

was moved with a de fonbrune micromanipulator (cit alcatel,
paris, france) under stereomicroscopic observation. the whole
system was filled with 150 mm nacl and connected to an electrometer amplifier (intra 767, world precision instrument). an
ag/agcl reference electrode was placed on the neck muscles. the
zero potential was determined in the fluid surrounding the endolymphatic sac. because of the similarity between the compositions of the microelectrode content and the endolymphatic sac
fluid, the esp value was not corrected for the junction potential.
injections into the perisaccular tissue. the time course
of esp under different conditions was studied in 72 animals (305
* 10 g body weight). in 11 animals the endolymphatic sac was
studied on each side, and in 56 animals, only on one side. the initial esp was measured as described above. a 5-pl solution was
injected in the perisaccular tissue with a 6- to 8-pm outside tip diameter glass micropipette. the duration of the injection was 5 to
10 minutes. the esp was discontinuously measured at 5,35, and
60 minutes after the end of the injection, and these determinations were extended up to 90, 120, and 150 minutes in some experiments.
solution of 9% nacl (150 mm, biopharma, paris, france)
was used in six experiments. in six additional experiments, nacl
solution was buffered with a hpo~--/hzpo~solution (0.2 m, ph
adjusted t o 7.4). other solutions were tested: culture medium
(n = 4;rpmi dutch modification, techgen, les ulis, france) and
100 mm nacl (n = 8). the tested drugs were:  xxxd2401xxx

m, n = 4;
paris, france),  xxxd279xxx  a1 (
m, n = 4;gift of k. altendorf, osnabriick, germany). the drugs
were dissolved in 150 mm nacl except for  xxxd279xxx , which
was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (dmso) (final dmso dilution: 1/1000 to 1/1000000 in 150 mm nacl, vol/vol). dmso alone
(1/1000, n = 3) was tested to rule out a possible effect of the solvent on the esp.

materials and methods
experimental procedures
adult male pigmented guinea pigs were purchased from elevage d’ardenay (ardenay, france). laboratory chow of constant
composition (c15-50, extralabo pietrement, provins, france) was
available to all animals until the beginning of the experiment.
free access to water was allowed.
the care and use of the animals used for this study were approved by ministgre de yagriculture et de la fort% (approval
number 5521).
animal preparation and endolymphatic sac approach. the animals were anesthetized with a n intramuscular
injection of 2 ml/kg body weight of a mixture of ketamine (50
mg/ml, panpharma; fougeres, france) and xylazine (2%,
rompun, bayer, leverkusen, germany) (2/1, vol/vol). the same
dose was reinjected after 30 minutes, and then a half-dose every
hour. a heating table maintained the body temperature between
36.5”c and 375°c. the breathing was spontaneous. the head of
the animal was fixed in a ventral position with a head holder.
the endolymphatic sac was approached through the posterior cerebral fossa. after a suboccipital craniotomy, the posterior
fossa dura mater was opened and the endolymphatic sac was approached intradurally after retraction of the hemicerebellum.
esp measurement. the esp was measured with a glass
microelectrode with a n outside tip diameter ranging from 3 to 5
km.the resistance of the microelectrode was in the range of 4 to
10 mr. the microelectrode was inserted in a holder containing a n
ag/agcl pellet (world precision instrument, sarasota, fl) and

statistical analysis
data are expressed as means i sem. a logarithmic transformation of the esp variable was performed to correct for lognormal distribution, heterogeneity of the variance, and multiplicative model. in logarithmic scale transformation of the
variable, the difference between the esp a t a given time and the
initial esp is equivalent to their ratio. thus the results are expressed as the ratio of the esp a t the considered time to the initial esp value. comparisons of the means were tested by a twoway (drug and time) analysis of variance (anova) with repeated
measurements for one factor (time) followed by fisher’s least significant difference test. differences were considered significant
a t a p < 0.05. the number of experiments corresponds to the
number of tested endolymphatic sacs.

results
initial esp value
the mean value of esp before injection was 8.4 2 0.3
mv ( n = 78). large variations were observed, the esp
ranging from +2.7 to +15 mv, lumen positive. no difference was observed between the different groups of animals (newman-keuls analysis).

effects of local injection on the esp
when 150 mm  xxxg2020xxx , used as the solvent of the
drugs, was injected into the perisaccular tissue, the esp
couloigner et al.: endolymphatic sac

decreased (p < 0.001) 5 minutes after the end of the injection. it returned to its initial value a t 60 minutes and surpassed it at 120 minutes (p < 0.01) (fig. 1).this pattern
was observed whether the ph of the solution was 6.2 (n =
6) or 7.2 (n = 6) (fig. 1).because of the absence of significant difference between these two groups (ph 6.2-7.21,the
data were pooled (table i).
to determine the mechanisms possibly involved in
the initial (5-minute) esp decrease (-64% k 6%, n = 12),
we studied the effect of various solutions including 100
mm nacl and culture medium containing k and hc03(rpmi). the time courses of esp in these different conditions were similar t o the one obtained with 150 mm nacl
(5-minute decrease: -50% 2 6% [n = 81 with 100 mm naci;
-48% k 10% [n = 41 with rpmi).
when different drugs were injected, the initial (5minute) decrease of esp was similar to the one observed
in the control group, except for acetazolamide (see below).

drug experiments
effect of atpase inhibitors. sixty minutes after
the injection of ouabain, the na+,k+-atpase inhibitor
m, n = 3), the esp was lower than in the control
group ( p < 0.01). (fig. 3). a 10-fold lower concentration
gave intermediate results a t 60 minutes (70% k 8.4%of
the initial esp, n = 4), lower than the control (114% *
9.4% of the initial esp, n = 12) and higher than with
m ouabain (42% k 7.8% of the initial esp, n = 3) but the
differences did not achieve significance.
 xxxd279xxx , an h+-atpase inhibitor, affected the
evolution of the esp as a function of the concentration.
between 35 and 120 minutes, a linear log-dose/effectrelationship between the esp inhibition percentage and the
concentration of  xxxd279xxx  was observed ( r = 0.968,p <
0.001; fig. 4). the effect of  xxxd279xxx  was not due to the
solvent. indeed, the effect of dmso (1/1000, n = 3) was
similar to the control (initial esp: +11.2 mv 0.17 mv;
esp at 60 minutes: +13.0 mv 2 2.00 mv; esp at 120 minutes: +22.2 mv k 0.20 mv).

to validate our preparation,  xxxd2401xxx , a beta agonist, was studied. indeed, a previous study has shown a
38% maximal decrease of the esp after the intravenous
injection of 25 pgkg  xxxd2401xxx ." the present study
confirmed this result: 120 and 150 minutes after the injection, esp remained lower (p < 0.05) than in the control
group (esp a t 150 minutes: +3.4 mv k 1.3 mv).
effect of diuretics. acetazolamide, an inhibitor of
carbonic anhydrase, induced a higher esp decrease at 5
minutes (-85% k 1.3%, n = 4) than 150 mm nacl ( p <
0.001). then the esp remained lower than in the control
group (p < 0.001) (fig. 2). chlorothiazide, a na-c1 cotransporter inhibitor, did not significantly modify the esp
evolution. bumetanide, a na-k-c1cotransporter inhibitor
(
m, n = 6;
hi, n = 6), did not modify the esp evolution. amiloride, an inhibitor of na/h exchanger and/or
na channel, altered the recovery of esp 60 minutes after
the injection (p < 0.05). then the esp remained lower
than after nacl injection.

discussion
the endolymphatic sac is involved in the resorption
of endolymph, and its dysfunction is probably one of the
mechanisms of meniere's disease. the aim of this study
was to examine the effect of locally applied drugs on the
esp in guinea pigs and thus to determine the membrane
transporters involved in ionic transport across the endolymphatic sac.
the injection of solutions in the basolateral tissue
surrounding the endolymphatic sac has been used in
other studies.4 in these studies, examination under light
microscopy did not show any histologic alteration of the
endolymphatic sac provoked by the basolateral injection.
in the present study, the method of basolateral injection
was preferred to the intravenous injection used in previous electrophysiologic studies11 because it avoided systemic effects of the tested drugs. thus indirect effects of
laryngoscope 108: april 1998

drugs on inner ear linked with an alteration of the body
fluid homeostasis or with a modification of the the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) secretion did not interfere with the
direct effects of these drugs on the endolymphatic sac. local administration also avoided lethal effects of drugs on
the animals, especially with ouabain and  xxxd279xxx . a
limitation of the basolateral injection technique is that
the exact localization of the drugs targets remains unsure
(vessels or nerves surrounding the endolymphatic sac,
basal or apical membranes of the sac epithelium). in any
case, except for acetazolamide, which inhibits carbonic
anhydrase, a n enzyme known to be present in the endolymphatic sac epithelium but also in its surrounding
connective tissue,7 the other tested drugs (ouabain,
 xxxd279xxx , amiloride, dids, bumetanide, chlorothiazide)
are reported to more or less specifically act on membrane
transporters. however, the major disturbance of the function of the sac was observed after the control injection of
 xxxg2020xxx . variations in the local hydrostatic pressure of the
basolateral compartment could be induced by the injection and thus modulate the ionic permeabilities of the intercellular junctions as already reported in the kidney

another hypothesis would be the opening of stretch-activated ionic channels.
in some cases of menibre’s disease no histologic lesions of the endolymphatic sac was observed, suggesting
that this disease may occur with a still functional endolymphatic sac. furthermore, the effects of diuretic
drugs in the classic model of endolymphatic hydrops induced by endolymphatic sac destruction4 show discrepancies with the therapeutic effects of these drugs on
mcniere’s disease. for instance, acetazolamide was found
to reduce hydrops induced by endolymphatic sac destruction, while  xxxd1680xxx , a thiazide diuretic, was ineffective.10 conversely, in clinical trials on meniere’s disease,
acetazolamide rarely cured meniere’s symptoms, sometimes even increasing them (for review see shinkawa and
kimuralo), while  xxxd1680xxx  proved to be efficient in
76% of the patients.12 these discrepancies may result
from the fact that diuretics can sometimes relieve
meniere’s symptoms by acting either on a functional enlaryngoscope 108: april 1998

dolymphatic sac or on other part of the inner ear such as
the stria vascularis in the cochlea or the dark cells in the
vestibule.
in the present study, two diuretic drugs lowered the
esp: acetazolamide, inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase, and
amiloride, a k-sparing diuretic acting on a na+/h+antiport andlor on a na+ channel. carbonic anhydrase is
known to be present in the endolymphatic sac epithelium,7 and acetazolamide was already shown to reduce
the esp after intravenous injection in guinea pigs.11 in a
murine study, takumida and bagger-sjobackl3 found
amiloride to induce a collapse of the endolymphatic sac
intercellular spaces, suggesting a decrease of absorption
of endolymph and a subsequent mild endolymphatic hydrops. in our study, bumetanide, a loop diuretic inhibiting
na+/k+/2cl- cotransport, as it has been shown after intravenous injection of furosemide,l4 did not alter the esp
evolution, whereas it is known to alter the endocochlear
potential14 (for review, see sterkers et al.1). similarly, no

effect of chlorothiazide, a diuretic of the thiazides family
that inhibits na+/cl- cotransport, was noticed. this observation is unexpected because chlorothiazide is the
most common diuretic prescribed in mbniere’s disease.15
diuretics have been shown, associated or not with lowsalt diet, to decrease the natural progression of the sensorineural loss in this disease.15 the association of
chlorothiazide and triamterene ( xxxd2294xxx ) was found to
have no beneficial effects on hearing and tinnitus but to
improve vertigo scores.16 nevertheless, in this study, both
treated and placebo groups displayed minimal vestibular
symptoms (less than 1incident of vertigo/month).
correlating the effects of diuretics on the esp with
modifications of fluid transports across the endolymphatic
sac would require experimental models of endolymphatic
hydrops leaving an intact endolymphatic sac. this kind of
model has already been developed using substances (e.g.,
cholera toxin and  xxxd1742xxx ) that increase endolymph secretion by the stria vascularis.17j8 a diuretic drug known
to act on the endolymphatic sac and that would reduce the
endolymphatic hydrops in such a model would be a good
candidate to treat cases of mbniere’s disease in which the
endolymphatic sac remains functional. in any case, discrepancies between the effects of diuretics in this model of
endolymphatic hydrops and in mbniere’s disease could
still occur. as a matter of fact, endolymphatic hydrops and
mbnibre’s disease are not equivalent, one being sometimes
present without the other. furthermore, in clinical trials,
indirect effects of the diuretics linked with an alteration of
the body fluid homeostasis or with a modification of the
csf secretion may interfere with the results. the doses
used in clinical trials are often smaller than the ones used
in animal experiments; despite this, diuretics often have
to be stopped because of their collateral effects (for review
see norriss).
since acetazolamide and amiloride, the two effective
diuretics on the esp in this study, act on acid-base transporters, we wondered if the basolateral injection of other
inhibitors of acid-base transports could alter the esp. in
fact,  xxxd279xxx , inhibitor of the vacuolar type h+-atpase, inhibited the recovery of the esp with a linear logdose effect between the esp inhibition percentage and
the concentration of  xxxd279xxx . dids, inhibitor of anionic transports, especially transports involving hc03-,
also inhibited the esp recovery. further studies with ionselective microelectrodes would help to confirm the presence of acid-base transporters in the endolymphatic sac
epithelium.
the last tested drug of this study was ouabain, inhibitor of the na+,k+-atpaset h a t is known to be present
in the basolateral membrane of the endolymphatic sac.19
moreover, it has been shown that na+,k+-atpaseplays a
role in the local fluid homeostasis in the endolymphatic
sac. one among several arguments is the observation of
reduced size of the lateral intercellular spaces after in
vivo administration of a food extract that inhibits the activity of na+,k+-atpase.zoin the present study, ouabain
inhibited the esp recovery, but its effect was smaller and
occurred later than with acetazolamide and  xxxd279xxx .
thus na+,k+-atpasemay be less directly involved in the
genesis of the esp than acid-base transporters.

this study suggests that ionic transports across the
endolymphatic sac are modified by two locally applied diuretic drugs, acetazolamide and amiloride. these diuretics probably act on acid-base transports that are essential
for the genesis of the esp. indeed, the esp is inhibited by
two other acid-base transporters inhibitors:  xxxd279xxx ,
blocker of the vacuolar type h+-atpase, and dids,
blocker of anionic transporters. further studies should be
performed to confirm the nature of the endolymphatic sac
acid-base transporters and to determine their relationship to endolymph homeostasis, with possible further applications to treatment of mbnibre’s disease.
