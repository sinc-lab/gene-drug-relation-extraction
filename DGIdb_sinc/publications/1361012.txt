abstract-effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on hypoxia or hypoxia/hypoglycemia (ischemia)-induced impair
ment of 2-deoxyglucose (2dg) uptake by rat hippocampal slices was evaluated. since  xxxd2647xxx  was
found to possess both a stimulating effect on acetylcholine release and a blocking effect on 5-ht2 re
ceptors, the improving effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on impaired 2dg uptake was compared to the findings
obtained with oxotremorine,  xxxd2419xxx  and pentobarbital. hippocampal slices were exposed to 20-min
ischemia, and then these slices were returned to oxygenated and glucose-containing buffer for 6 hr.
ischemia reduced 30 mm kci-induced 2dg uptake by the hippocampus. pretreatment with  xxxd2647xxx ,
oxotremorine, pentobarbital and  xxxd2419xxx  attenuated the ischemia-induced decline of 2dg uptake. in
addition,  xxxd2647xxx , oxotremorine and pentobarbital relatively recovered the increase of 2dg uptake
in the hippocampal slices under hypoxia for 45 min. the present results suggest that  xxxd2647xxx  exerts a
neuroprotective action against ischemia-induced deficit of energy metabolism in vitro.

 xxxd2647xxx , 3-(2-morpholino-ethylamino)-4-methyl-6
phenylpyridazine dihydrochloride, is an atypical anti
depressant drug (1, 2). in addition to this property,
 xxxd2647xxx  is effective for the treatment of multi-infarct
and alzheimer-type senile dementia (3). in addition,
 xxxd2647xxx  improves the memory impairment in mongo
lian gerbils (4) and in rats (5) caused by cerebral ische
mia.  xxxd2647xxx  prevents both the reduction of hippo
campal theta waves and a delayed neuronal death in
the hippocampal cai subregion induced by the bilat
eral occlusion of the carotid arteries of mongolian gerbils
(6). in biochemical experiments, muramatsu et al. dem
onstrated that  xxxd2647xxx  increases the release of
acetylcholine (ach) from the hippocampus by a block
ing action on the 5-ht2 receptors located on cholin
ergic nerve terminals (7).
because glucose is the major energy substrate for
nervous tissue, 2-deoxyglucose (2dg) uptake is an in
dex of regional energy consumption, which is linked in
turn to neuronal activity (8, 9). recently we reported
that hypoxia or ischemia changed the 2dg uptake by

serotonin,

acetylcholine

hippocampal slices, and this change was attenuated by
treatments with n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antago
nists and pentobarbital, suggesting that the impairment
of 2dg uptake can serve as a marker of ischemia-in
duced functional deficits in vitro (10, 11).
the present study was therefore undertaken to in
vestigate the protective effect of  xxxd2647xxx  against the
abnormal change of 2dg uptake by hippocampal slices
induced by hypoxia or ischemia. this result was com
pared with other drugs, pentobarbital, the 5-ht2 recep
tor antagonist  xxxd2419xxx , and the cholinergic receptor
agonist oxotremorine.
materials and methods
materials and procedure
male wistar rats weighing 250-300 g were used.
animals were decapitated and the cerebrum was re
moved quickly from the skull and cooled in ice-cold
krebs-ringer solution for about 1 min. the coronal
hippocampal slices (450-,um-thick) was prepared using a
tissue chopper. slices were isolated within 5 min after
decapitation. the composition of the control krebs

solution, equilibrated with 95% 02-5% co2, was: 129
mm naci, 1.3 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 22.4 mm nahco3, 1.2 mm
kh2po4, 4.2 mm kci, 10.0 mm glucose and 1.5 mm
cac12. the slices were held between two sheets of
nylon mesh.
the chamber design, slice transfer methods, and in
cubation procedures were described in our previous re
ports (10, 12). the buffer had a ph of 7.3-7.4
throughout the experiment. the temperature was 37°c
in all phases of the experiment. for induction of hypo
glycemia, the glucose in the incubation medium was re
placed by 10 mm sucrose. hypoxia solution was equili
brated with a 95% n2 5% co2 gas mixture for at least
1 hr.
treatment with drugs
preparations were preincubated with standard krebs
solution for 1 hr. slices were exposed to normal krebs
ringer solution containing the drug for 20 min before
the induction of hypoxia/hypoglycemia (ischemia) and
then removed. these were then placed in ischemic solu
tion containing the drug for 10 or 20 min. following
this procedure, the slices were removed from the ische
mic solution. after 10-min ischemia, the slices were
washed with normal krebs-ringer solution for 2 min,
and then the slices were incubated with krebs-ringer
solution containing [14c]2dg. in the 20-min ischemia
group, the slices were placed in normal krebs-ringer
solution for 6 hr and then incubated with krebs-ringer
solution containing [14c]2dg. some slices were incu
bated with normal krebs-ringer solution containing
[14c]2dg and the drug for 45 min.
2dg uptake
slices were incubated with krebs-ringer solution
containing 0.2 ,aci/ml of [14c]2dg [spec. act. 50
mci/mmol; amersham] and 30 mm kci for 45 min.
the incubation chamber was arranged to recirculate 14
ml of buffer at 4.4 ml/min with continuous bubbling of
humidified 95% 02 5% co2 through the buffer as it
entered the chamber. to initiate an incubation, the
slices held between the two mesh sheets were removed
from the preincubation chamber and drained briefly;
1 ml of the isotope buffer was pipetted over the slices,
which were then placed in the incubation chamber
within 10 sec of removal from the first chamber. in
this manner, a square-wave pulse of radioactivity was
delivered to the slices. incubations were terminated by
removing the disk preparations from the incubation
chamber, rinsing it with 20 ml of warm buffer and plac
ing it in a chamber identical to the preincubation cham
ber for 30 min. at the end of the washout period, slices
were placed on dry ice to stop the metabolism and were

then frozen at -80°c. the time from the final buffer
drainage to freezing was within 10 sec.
for biochemical assay, the frozen tissue was homog
enized in 1 ml phosphate solution containing 0.5% per
chloric acid, and a 450-,ul aliquot of homogenate was
used to determine the total amount of protein. the
radioactivity in another 450,ul of the homogenate was
measured in a liquid scintillation counter after the
homogenate was solubilized.
drugs
the drugs used in this study were  xxxd2647xxx  (taisho
pharmaceu. inc., japan), oxotremorine (funakoshi
inc., japan), pentobarbital (tanabe inc., japan), and
 xxxd2419xxx  (funakoshi inc., japan). all drugs
were dissolved in distilled water and then diluted with
krebs-ringer solution. the krebs-ringer solution con
taining drugs (100 ,um) had a ph between 7.2 7.4, and
these values were not different from those of the non
treated solution (ph 7.3 -7.4).
statistical analyses
data are expressed as means ± s.e. significant dif
ferences between groups were determined with an
analysis of variance followed by the duncan test.
results
2dg and hypoxia
the 2dg uptake was observed under the hypoxic
condition for 45 min. under the hypoxic condition,
2dg uptake in the hippocampal slices increased to 296
± 35% (n = 12) that of normoxic control slices. the
hypoxia-induced increase in 2dg uptake was signifi
cantly attenuated by  xxxd2647xxx , pentobarbital and oxo
tremorine (fig. 1). under the normoxic condition, 2dg
uptake by the hippocampus, which was compared to
the control vehicle-treated slices, was not significantly
affected by  xxxd2647xxx  (105 ± 6.4%, n = 6 by 10,um
and 107 ± 4.4%, n = 5 by 100 mm), pentobarbital
(114 ± 8.1%, n = 5 by 10,um and 89 ± 3.87%, n = 5
by 100,um), and oxotremorine (103 ± 3.3%, n = 12 by
1,um and 90 ± 2.7%, n = 12 by 10mm).
2dg uptake and ischemia
when normal slices were incubated with 2dg follow
ing a 1-hr preincubation, 30 mm kcl-induced uptake of
2dg in the hippocampus reached 33.2 ± 1.5, (n = 3)
dpm/mg protein/45 min. the time course of the recov
ery rate of 2dg uptake in slices following 10-min and
20-min ischemia was compared to that of normal slices
(fig. 2). slices were exposed to 10-min ischemia, and

slices was significantly increased. however after the 30

treatment with  xxxd2647xxx , pentobarbital and oxotre

(fig. 4). in addition, treatment with the  xxxg1113xxx

against the impairment of 2dg uptake. the 2dg up

is 49 ± 2.3% (n = 12), and the decrease of 2dg up
take is attenuated by  xxxd2419xxx  at doses of 1 u m (55

discussion
in the

present

experiment,

45-min

hypoxia

and

10

min ischemia
increased
2dg uptake
in hippocampal
slices, but 20-min ischemia decreased
it. at present, the
reason

for these

differences

is uncertain,

but a possible

explanation is that hypoxia or mild ischemia such as 10
min ischemia may increase anaerobic metabolism and
result in an increase in the rate of 2dg phosphoryla
tion, whereas 20-min ischemia may decline energy de
mands due to metabolic injury. newman et al. (12)
already demonstrated similar changes using thick slices
as an in vitro ischemia model. a transient increase in
release of neurotrasmitters including glutamate occurs
during ischemia (13, 14). therefore, glutamate may de
polarize and stimulate 2dg uptake of hippocampal
neurons in the early stage of ischemia. treatment with
 xxxd2647xxx  (10 and 100,um) attenuated the increase of
2dg uptake under the hypoxic condition, but the same
concentration of this drug did not change 2dg uptake
under normal conditions. when the 2dg uptake was
examined immediately after 10-min ischemia, it was sig
nificantly increased in the hippocampus. the treatment
with  xxxd2647xxx  (10,um) attenuated this increase. in
addition, 2dg uptake of slices exposed to 20-min ische
mia was impaired, and this impairment of 2dg uptake
was also attenuated by the treatment with  xxxd2647xxx 
(10 and 100,um). in the previous in vivo experiment, it
was demonstrated that  xxxd2647xxx  prevented both
ischemia-induced hippocampal damage and the passive
avoidance deficit (4, 6). in addition,  xxxd2647xxx  shows a
protective effect against cerebral hypoxia and anoxia in
a variety of animal models (15). the present results dem
onstrate that hypoxia or ischemia-induced abnormal
change of 2dg uptake, an index of regional energy
consumption, is significantly attenuated by the treat
ment with  xxxd2647xxx . this in vitro result is well-consis
tent with previous in vivo results. these findings sug
gest that the attenuating effect of  xxxd2647xxx  on energy
metabolism may play an important role in the amelio
ration of behavioral deficits in a variety of ischemic
models (4, 5).
at present, the mechanism of protection by minap
rine is uncertain, and the precise mechanism should be
clarified in the future. biochemical experiments suggest
that  xxxd2647xxx  acts as a cholinergic drug, because
 xxxd2647xxx  increases the release of ach from the hippo
campus by its blocking action on 5-ht2 receptors (7).
therefore in the present experiment, we examined the
effects of oxotremorine and a  xxxg1113xxx  antago
nist on the abnormal change of 2dg uptake induced by
hypoxia or ischemia. this abnormal change of 2dg up
take was significantly attenuated by treatment with oxo
tremorine. at present, the precise mechanism of mus
carinic receptor agonist-induced neuroprotection is un
certain. most studies have emphasized the detrimental
role of excessive release of glutamate in producing
ischemic injury (13, 14). the stimulation of muscarinic
receptor by oxotremorine or ach inhibits an en

dogeneous release of glutamate and aspartate from the
hippocampus (16, 17). thus inhibition of glutamate and
aspartate release by oxotremorine might have important
pharmacological implications in the protection against a
loss of 2dg uptake during ischemia.
the stimulation of  xxxg1113xxx  modulates the in
crease of inositol phospholipid turnover and release of
 xxxd208xxx  (18, 19), and these may also stimulate
the release of intracellular calcium. the increase of
cellular calcium ions is thought to be an important trig
ger in ischemic cell death (20, 21). although auto
radiographic studies indicate the existence of 5-ht2
binding sites in the hippocampus (22-24), their density
is low in this region. however muramatsu et al. (7) has
observed binding sites for [3h]- xxxd2419xxx  in hippocam
pal homogenates. in addition, release of arachidonic
acid and inositol phosphate mediated by 5-ht2 recep
tors are observed in cultures of hippocampal cells (19).
taking these facts into consideration, we propose that
 xxxd2419xxx  may reduce ischemia-induced impairment of
2dg uptake in hippocampal slices, through its blocking
action on 5-ht2 receptors.  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists,
naftidrofuryl and emopamil, exhibited a protective
effect against ischemic neuronal damage in gerbils and
rats (25, 26). in addition, behavioral experiments dem
onstrated that  xxxg1113xxx  antagonists can amelio
rate a hypoxia-induced performance deficits in an ani
mal model of learning and memory (27). these lines of
evidence along with the present results have suggested
possible interactions between cholinergic and sero
tonergic receptor mechanisms in the neuroprotective ac
tion of  xxxd2647xxx .
pentobarbital prevented hypoxia or ischemia-induced
abnormal change of 2dg uptake by hippocampal slices.
in in vivo experiments, it was reported that pentobar
bital prevented the ischemia-induced neuronal death of
ca1 pyramidal cells. thus pentobarbital may amelio
rate neuronal damage to hippocampal cells by either
inhibiting protein kinase c activity or enhancing the
gaba-ergic inhibitory effect (28, 29).
in summary, the present results suggest that minap
rine possesses a neuroprotective action against
ischemia-induced impairment of energy metabolism in
vitro. this neuroprotective effect of  xxxd2647xxx  may be
related to the amelioration of behavioral deficits by
 xxxd2647xxx  in the in vivo model of ischemia.
