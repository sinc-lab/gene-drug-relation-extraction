not clear how  xxxd3255xxx  inhibits synthesis of some
prostaglandins [lo], without inhibiting directly the activity
of cox-1 and cox-2
[13]. it was suggested that the
inhibitory effect of  xxxd3255xxx  may be related to the
inhibition of other enzymes of the  xxxd208xxx  cascade
or to inhibition of the cellular signalling leading to the
activation of cox [13].

showed reduction

the authors suggested, but did not

determine whether the above findings mean that there is

yet determined mechanisms,
the secretion of il-2 and
ifn-?/ from cultured human t lymphocytes [ll]. sulfapyridine and  xxxd2579xxx  have no effect [ill.

 xxxd3255xxx  has an inhibitory effect on the arachidonic

acid cascade, reducing the synthesis of selected eicosanoids

evaluation of disease activity [32,34]. in the ileal mucosa in
crohn’s disease the content of splaz mrna is very high,

the impact of  xxxd3255xxx  on enzymes that proximally
control the  xxxd208xxx  cascade, such as spla, or

and it was suggested that spla,

cpla,, have been reported.
non-pancreatic
phospholipases a,, such as low molecular weight splaz and high molecular weight cpla, are
distributed widely in mammalian
cells [20]. cpla,
is
primarily responsible for intracellular
initiation
of the
 xxxd208xxx  cascade, is not released extracellularly,
and does not have direct proinflammatory activity [21]. to
the contrary, spla,, in addition to its participation
arachidonic
acid cascade, was found to initiate

in the
and/or

propagate a variety of inflammatory reactions [20]. several
clinical and experimental
lines of evidence support the
above notion. very high activity and immunoreactivity
of
 xxxg1760xxx  were found in the synovial fluids in inflammatory
arthritides [22], and its serum level correlates with the
activity of rheumatoid arthritis [23]. very high enzymatic
activity of circulating spla, was observed in systemic
inflammatory reaction syndromes such as septic shock [24],
malaria [25], or salicylate poisoning [26]. experimentally,
spla, induces dose- and time-dependent
inflammatory
reaction after injection into joints [27, 281, subcutaneous
skin pouches [29], or the skin [30].
spla,, identical to that discovered
[31], was implicated as a pathogenetic

may be related

to the

recurrent ileitis [36]. furthermore,
in actively inflamed
colonic mucosa in crohn’s disease and in ulcerative colitis,
spla, protein and enzymatic activity and circulating
spla, activity were found to be much higher than in
inactive crohn’s patients or in controls [32, 34, 351.
although the cells investigated by us (osteoblasts) are more
relevant

to articular diseases than to intestinal

disorders,

the fact that spla* in inflammatory bowel diseases is
identical to that found in the articular milieu [31-361 may
imply that the cells that synthesize and release splaz in the
intestinal tract respond to  xxxd3255xxx  in the same way.
furthermore, it was reported that various cells that synthesize spla, share common regulatory pathways [37-391.
the above studies have shown that spla, activity
correlates with disease activity in those conditions that
respond to therapy with  xxxd3255xxx . therefore,
it was
important to investigate whether  xxxd3255xxx  is capable of
inhibiting spla,. our study has shown that  xxxd3255xxx 
and its analogue, cl 42a, markedly suppress the release of
spla, from osteoblasts. the fact that  xxxd3255xxx  inhibited spla, release, regardless of whether the cells were
stimulated

with cytokines,

 xxxd1773xxx 

analogue,

or lps/

in synovial fluids
factor in crohn’s

 xxxd1742xxx , provides evidence that the pathway of stimulation was irrelevant to the inhibitory activity of sulfasala-

disease and ulcerative colitis [31-361. it was suggested that
mucosal spla, content may reflect the degree of inflammation [33, 35, 361 and that in crohn’s disease and
ulcerative colitis circulating spla, may be useful in the

zine.  xxxd3255xxx  had no effect on the content of mrna
of spla,,
cpla,,
or cox-2 and did not inhibit the
synthesis of intracellular splaz protein.

be sensitive enough to detect pla, accumulation. stimulated frco exposed to  xxxd3255xxx  or to cl 42a were
found to release more pge, than stimulated controls. this
finding confirms the results of others who have shown an
increase in pge, release from human platelets stimulated
with  xxxd208xxx  and exposed to  xxxd3255xxx  [lo]. our
findings suggest that intracellular accumulation of pla, is
activating the path of eicosanoid synthesis, at least as far as
pge, is concerned.
in summary, the effect of  xxxd3255xxx  on spla,

impact on spla, release seems to be selective. the above
findings add a new aspect to the elucidation of antigelatinase

since the mrnas of spla,, cpla,,

seems also to be post-transcriptional.
 xxxd3255xxx  had no
effect on the release of gelatinase from the cells. thus, the
