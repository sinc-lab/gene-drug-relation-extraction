for the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist ly293284
in the drug discrimination assay in rats

abstract rationale: aripiprazole ( xxxd221xxx ) is a novel
atypical antipsychotic drug with a low incidence of side
effects. the therapeutic action of aripiprazole has been
attributed to its unique agonist/antagonist effects at d2
dopamine receptors; however, aripiprazole also has
significant in vitro affinity at 5-ht1a receptors. objectives: the 5-ht1a agonist property of aripiprazole has so
far not been evaluated in any in vivo assay. methods: thirteen male sprague dawley rats trained to
discriminate the 5-ht1a agonist ly 293284 (75 nmol/
kg) from saline, using a fixed ratio (fr) 50 schedule of
food-reinforcement in a two-lever operant-conditioning
task, were used to evaluate the behavioral effect of
aripiprazole at 5-ht1a receptors. results: aripiprazole
fully mimicked ly 293284 in a drug-discrimination assay
with an ed50 of 1.39 mmol/kg (0.62 mg/kg). in combination tests, aripiprazole did not block the ly 293284 cue
but at 8.92 mmol/kg (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced the
response rate by lowering the threshold for induction of
the 5-ht syndrome produced by the training dose of ly
293284. moreover, the selective  xxxg1108xxx  receptor antagonist way 100635 was able to block the substitution of
aripiprazole in ly-293284 trained rats. conclusion: although the efficacy of aripiprazole against the positive
symptoms of schizophrenia may be related to its dopamine receptor interactions, it seems possible that its
atypical profile may derive, at least in part, from its  xxxg1108xxx  agonist effect, rather than from unusual  xxxg656xxx 
properties.

introduction
aripiprazole, “ablify” 7-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)1-piperazinyl]butyloxy}- xxxd1818xxx )-quinolinone
( xxxd221xxx ), is a novel atypical antipsychotic drug with
a low incidence of side effects recently approved by the
fda (food & drug administration) (goodnick and jerry
2002). in vitro, aripiprazole has significant interactions at
a large number of gpcrs (g-protein-coupled receptors)
that include d2, d3, and d4 dopamine receptors, 5-ht1a,
5-ht2a, 5-ht2b, 5-ht2c,  xxxg1119xxx , and 5-ht7 serotonin
(5-ht) receptors, and the  xxxg1078xxx  (lawler
et al. 1999; shapiro et al. 2003). much excitement has
been generated by reports that aripiprazole is a dopamine
d2 “partial agonist” (burris et al. 2002) or a “functionally
selective” dopamine agonist (lawler et al. 1999; shapiro
et al. 2003). therefore, the mechanism of action of
aripiprazole appears to differ from that of currently
marketed typical and atypical antipsychotics.
previous preclinical studies have provided evidence
that aripiprazole is a dopamine–serotonin system “stabilizer” with potent partial agonist activity at dopamine d2
and 5-ht1a receptors and antagonist activity at 5-ht2a
receptors (inoue et al. 1996; jordan et al. 2001; burris et
al. 2002). in vivo, aripiprazole has been shown to have
potent agonist activity at dopamine autoreceptors. for
example, aripiprazole decreases g–butyrolactone- and
reserpine-induced 3, xxxd2471xxx  (dopa)
accumulation (kikuchi et al. 1995), consistent with a
decrease in presynaptic  xxxg2276xxx  activity. the
inhibitory effect of aripiprazole on g-butyrolactoneinduced dopa accumulation is blocked by the d2
receptor antagonist haloperidol. administration of aripiprazole to laboratory rats results in decreased extracellular levels of dopamine in the striatum and frontal cortex,
suggestive of decreased release of dopamine (semba et al.
1995). finally, the ability of aripiprazole to decrease
spontaneous firing of dopaminergic neurons in the ventral
tegmental area by activation of d2 autoreceptors was
shown by in vivo extracellular recording (momiyama et
al. 1996).

416

whereas results of the above studies are consistent
with agonist activity of aripiprazole at d2 receptors, in
other in vivo studies, aripiprazole displays  xxxg656xxx 
antagonist properties. for example, aripiprazole blocks
apomorphine-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity
and does not produce stereotypy or increased locomotion
when administered alone (kikuchi et al. 1995). administration of aripiprazole to male rats also results in a
twofold increase in the level of serum prolactin, additional evidence of d2 antagonist effects (inoue et al.
1996). also, aripiprazole has a mixed agonist/antagonist
profile at dopamine d2 receptors located on lactotrophs
and exerts an antagonistic or agonistic action depending
on the preexisting dopaminergic tone (fujikawa et al.
1996). aripiprazole evoked yawning without inducing
stereotypy but antagonized talipexole-induced yawning
and apomorphine-induced stereotypy (fujikawa et al.
1996). in addition, the yawning induced by  xxxd221xxx 
was potentiated by treatment with  xxxd2957xxx  or reserpine.
thus, aripiprazole exhibits weak agonist and stronger
antagonist effects at dopamine d2 receptors involved in
yawning behavior. yawning and suppression of exploration by dopamine agonists is thought to be mediated by
postsynaptic dopamine receptors, but not by presynaptic
autoreceptors, because the change in extracellular dopamine concentration is not related to the behavior (stahle
et al. 1990; stahle 1992). although  xxxd221xxx  activates
dopamine d2 autoreceptors (kikuchi et al. 1995), it does
not induce postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating
behavioral changes, but rather antagonizes apomorphineinduced behaviors such as hyperlocomotion, stereotypy
and rotation, in kainate-lesioned animals.
the treatment of schizophrenia must address not only
the positive symptoms but also the negative symptoms,
which include disturbance of affect and cognition.
although a variety of gpcrs have been considered as
targets for atypical antipsychotics, the  xxxg1108xxx  is
attracting increasing interest. in addition to its potential
importance in anxiolytic and antidepressant action (de
vry 1995), it may be involved in cognitive function
(ridley et al. 1996). furthermore, this receptor may
contribute to the clinical efficacy of some of the atypical
antipsychotic drugs and their low liability for extrapyramidal side effects (eps). for example, clozapine and
quetiapine have high affinity at human 5-ht1a receptors
in post-mortem tissue relative to their dopamine d2
affinities, which may be of importance at normal clinical
doses (mason and reynolds 1992; elliot and reynolds
1999; richelson and souder 2000). thus, although the
role of 5-ht1a receptors in antipsychotic drug efficacy
remains speculative, this relationship deserves further
study to enhance our understanding of the mechanism
underlying antipsychotic drug action.
following this line of inquiry, jordan et al. (2002)
reported that aripiprazole is a potent, partial agonist at the
human  xxxg1108xxx . this property of aripiprazole has
so far only been evaluated very briefly in vivo by wolff et
al. (2003). these workers reported that none of the
antipsychotic drugs they studied (aripiprazole, ziprasi-

done, risperidone, and olanzapine) induced 5-ht1a-like
behavioral effects that included flat body posture and
lower lip retraction, nor did these antipsychotics antagonize 8-oh-dpat (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)
tetralin) behavior induced by the 5-ht1a agonist 8-ohdpat. in the present study, a drug discrimination
procedure in rats was used to evaluate the discriminative
stimulus effect and relative potency of aripiprazole at the
 xxxg1108xxx  relative to the extremely potent and
selective 5-ht1a agonist ly 293284 (foreman et al.
1994) used as the training drug.

materials and methods
animals
thirteen male sprague dawley rats (harlan laboratories, indianapolis, in) were trained to discriminate ly 293284 (75 nmol/kg,
i.p.) from saline, using a two-lever, food-reinforced operant
conditioning task. none of the rats had previously received drugs
or behavioral training. water was freely available in the individual
home cages and a rationed amount of supplemental feed (labdiet5001, pmi, nutrition international, llc, brentwood, mo) was
made available after experimental sessions so as to maintain
approximately 80% of free-feeding weight. lights were on from
0700 hours to 1900 hours. the laboratory and animal facility
temperature was 22–24c and the relative humidity was 40–50%.
experiments were performed between 0900 hours and 1700 hours
each day, monday–friday. the “guide for the care and use of
laboratory animals” (nih, 1996) was followed in the present
experiments and the protocol was approved by the purdue
university animal care and use committee.
apparatus
six standard operant conditioning chambers (model e10–10rf,
coulbourn instruments, lehigh valley, pa) consisted of modular
test cages enclosed within sound-attenuated cubicles with fans for
ventilation and background white noise. a white house light was
centered near the top of the front panel of the cage, which was also
equipped with two response levers, separated by a food hopper
(combination dipper pellet trough, model e14–06, module size 1/
2), all positioned 2.5 cm above the floor. solid-state logic in an
adjacent room, interfaced through a med associates (lafayette, in)
interface to a personal computer, controlled reinforcement and data
acquisition with a locally written program.
discrimination training and testing
a fixed-ratio (fr) 50 schedule of food reinforcement (noyes 45 mg
dustless pellets, research diets, inc., nj) in a two-lever paradigm
was used. the drug discrimination procedure details have been
described elsewhere (marona-lewicka and nichols 1994). at least
one drug and one saline session separated each test session. rats
were required to maintain the 85% correct responding criterion on
training days in order to be tested. in addition, test data were
discarded when the accuracy criterion of 85% was not achieved on
the two training sessions following a test session. test drugs were
administered i.p. 30 min prior to the sessions, or for combination
tests antagonists were injected 30 min before training drug or
aripiprazole administration. test sessions were run under conditions of extinction, with rats removed from the operant chamber
when 50 presses were emitted on either lever. if 50 presses on one
lever were not completed within 5 min, the session was ended and
scored as a disruption.

417
drugs
ly 293284 was a generous gift from eli lilly & co. (indianapolis,
in), aripiprazole ( xxxd221xxx ) was synthesized by otsuka pharmaceutical ltd. (tokushima, japan), and way 100635 was
synthesized in our laboratory. solution for injections of aripiprazole
was prepared by soaking the dry-weighed drug with two drops of
80% l-lactic acid (sigma, st. louis, mo) followed by dilution with
distilled water to give the necessary concentration.
data analysis
data from the drug-discrimination study were scored in a quantal
fashion, with the lever on which the rat first emitted 50 presses in a
test session scored as the “selected” lever. the percentage of rats
selecting the drug lever (%sdl) for each dose of test compound
was determined. the degree of substitution was determined by the
maximum %sdl for all doses of the test drug. if the drug was one
that completely substituted for the training drug (at least one dose
resulted in a %sdl=80% or higher) the method of litchfield and
wilcoxon (1949) was used to determine the ed50 and 95%
confidence interval (95% c.i.). if the percentage of rats disrupted
(%d) was 80% or higher, the ed50 value for disruption was
determined. the same method was used to determine the inhibition
ed50 and 95% confidence interval (95% c.i.) if the maximum
percentage of rats selecting the saline lever was 80% or higher for
at least one dose of antagonist used in a combination test.

results
figure 1 shows the effect of aripiprazole in substitution
tests in rats trained to discriminate ly 293284 from
saline. although aripiprazole is less potent than ly
293284, it nevertheless produced full substitution with an
ed50 of 1.39 mmol/kg (ci: 0.92–2.1 mmol/kg) versus
0.024 mmol/kg (ci: 0.015–0.036 mmol/kg) for the training
drug. surprisingly, aripiprazole did not produce a 5-ht
syndrome at doses up to 35.7 mmol/kg (16 mg/kg); doses
four times higher than those that produced full substitution (8.92 mmol/kg, 4 mg/kg). the highest dose of
aripiprazole used in substitution tests reduced the response rate, however, so that only eight of twelve tested
rats were able to emit 50 presses during the 5-min test. in

discussion
the current studies provide the first in vivo evidence that
activation of 5-ht1a receptors can play a role in
aripiprazole-mediated behavior in rats, where aripiprazole
fully mimicked the 5-ht1a agonist ly 293284 at
pharmacologically relevant doses. moreover, the selective
 xxxg1108xxx  antagonist way 100635 blocked the
discriminative stimulus effects of aripiprazole.
previously, we have shown that  xxxd2498xxx , a mixed
serotonergic/dopaminergic agonist fully mimicked ly
293284 in the drug-discrimination assay in rats (maronalewicka et al. 2002). moreover,  xxxd2498xxx  produced a
significant dose-related expression of serotonin syndromes that were blocked by the 5-ht1a antagonist
pmppi (marona-lewicka et al. 2002). there are several
significant differences in the pharmacological profile
represented by  xxxd2498xxx  and aripiprazole.  xxxd2498xxx  is an
agonist at dopaminergic d2-like receptors and has an
agonist profile with significant affinity for a variety for a
central monoamine receptors that include not only
dopamine but also serotonin and adrenergic receptors
(sundaram et al. 1995; piercey et al. 1996; egan et al.
1998, 2000; mcpherson 1984). aripiprazole behaves as a
partial agonist at d2-like dopamine receptors and is
proposed to have dual agonist and antagonist properties
(lawler et al. 1999; shapiro et al. 2003), partial agonist
activity at 5-ht1a receptors (jordan et al. 2002), an
antagonist effect at the  xxxg1113xxx  (lawler et al.
1999; shapiro et al. 2003) and antagonist activity at a1and a2-adrenoceptors (kalkman and loetscher 2003).
differences between the in vitro affinity and efficacy of
 xxxd2498xxx  and aripiprazole at 5-ht1a receptors are essential
for their potency in substitution tests in rats trained to
discriminate ly 293284 from saline.  xxxd2498xxx  (ki=
0.19 nm) has only about three times lower affinity in
radioligand binding assays at the  xxxg1108xxx  than
ly 293284 (ki=0.053 nm) (marona-lewicka et al. 2002),
and aripiprazole has one hundred times lower affinity
(ki=5.6 nm; shapiro et al. 2003).  xxxd2498xxx , which acts as
full agonist at the  xxxg1108xxx , fully mimicked ly
293284 with a potency comparable to the training drug
(marona-lewicka et al. 2002), whereas aripiprazole, a
potent but only partial agonist, fully mimicked ly
293284, but was about sixty times less potent.
we did not, however, observe development of any
component of the 5-ht syndrome after aripiprazole
administration, although  xxxd2498xxx  produces significant
dose-related expression of the serotonin syndrome. this
observation is consistent with the report by wolff et al.
(2003) on the absence of the 5-ht1a-mediated behavioral
syndrome after treatment with aripiprazole, and the
inability of aripiprazole to block 8-oh-dpat-mediated

behaviors. in fact, in rats trained to discriminate ly
293284 from saline, although pretreatment with aripiprazole before the training drug did not affect the discriminative stimulus effect of ly 293484, the threshold for
development of the serotonin syndrome was lowered,
such that most of the rats that were disrupted in the
operant test showed at least lower lip retraction and flat
body posture. these results might suggest that aripiprazole is free from functional antagonism at 5-ht1a
receptors and that its other pharmacological properties
might mask or even inhibit development of the 5-ht
syndrome mediated by stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors.
several studies have indicated that dopamine-dependent systems enable some components of the 5-ht
syndrome but inhibit others. for example, hillegaart et al.
(2000) concluded that mesencephalic dopaminergic
mechanisms are involved in the stereotyped forward
locomotion characteristically seen after systemic administration of  xxxg1108xxx  agonists. stereotyped forward locomotion and inhibition of rearing produced by 8oh-dpat were attenuated by pretreatment with haloperidol, a preferential d2 antagonist. blockade of postsynaptic d2 receptors masks actions of the 5-ht1a agonist
ly 165,163 in a spontaneous tail-flick (stf) paradigm
that depends on functionally intact dopamine d2 receptors
for its expression (millan et al. 1995). thus, it seems
possible that the mixed agonist/antagonist (or functionally
selective) properties of aripiprazole at dopamine d2
receptors interrupts development of 5-ht1a-mediated
behavioral syndrome. in fact, it has been reported that
the putative 5-ht1a agonist ly 165163 also failed to
induce any component of the 5-ht syndrome, even at
high doses (hutson et al. 1987), an effect that was
attributed to its potent dopamine d2 antagonist properties
(donohoe et al. 1987). moreover, we did not observe
stereotypic behaviors that would be characteristic of
dopamine receptor stimulation, even after high-dose
aripiprazole administration. piercey et al. (1994) reported
that u-67413b, a compound with agonist properties at
both d2 (ki=3.6 nm) and 5-ht1a (ki=10 nm) receptors
elicited only the 5-ht syndrome, without producing
stereotypies characteristic of dopaminergic agonists. all
of these observations suggest complex functional interactions where activation of 5-ht1a receptors by aripiprazole inhibits d2-mediated stereotypy, whereas  xxxg656xxx 
blockade by aripiprazole can totally block 5-ht1amediated behavioral syndromes.
the a1-adrenoceptor antagonistic property of aripiprazole may also contribute to the lack of expression of the
5-ht1a-mediated 5-ht syndrome, although its antagonist
action at a2-adrenoceptors (kalkman and loetscher 2003)
might counteract this effect. the spinal population of a1and a2-adrenoceptors, respectively, mediates and inhibits
the induction of stf by  xxxg1108xxx  agonists, the
action of which is dependent on functionally intact,
descending, noradrenergic projections to the lumbar
spinal cord (bervoets and millan 1993). in the stf
paradigm, the high-efficacy agonist action of (+)flesinoxan and ly 165,163 at 5-ht1a receptors is masked

419

by their intrinsic a1a-antagonist properties, the neutralization of which by a1-agonists reveals the activation of
5-ht1a receptors (millan et al. 1993).
it seems possible that the sedation observed in the
present study after combined treatment with way
100635 and aripiprazole could result from activation of
presynaptic d2 receptors by aripiprazole, a behavior that
is masked by its  xxxg1108xxx  agonist effect. if true,
this finding would provide additional evidence of an in
vivo functional interaction between 5-ht1a and dopamine  xxxg656xxx  systems.
a variety of preclinical data has suggested that the  xxxg1108xxx  receptor is a therapeutic target for the development
of improved antipsychotic drugs (ahlenius 1988; meltzer
1999; millan 2000; bantick et al. 2001). the background
for involvement of the  xxxg1108xxx  in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is based on the observation that
the density (bmax) of high-affinity [3h]8-oh-dpat sites
is significantly elevated by an average of 79% in
postmortem prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics (hashimoto et al. 1991; joyce et al. 1993; sumiyoshi et al.
1996). increased  xxxg1108xxx  expression in prefrontal
cortex of patients with schizophrenia may be an adaptive
attempt to normalize diminished 5-ht1a-mediated neurotransmission. moreover, cortical 5-ht1a receptors were
increased in both antipsychotic-treated and antipsychoticfree schizophrenic groups (joyce et al. 1997).
the low liability of some atypical antipsychotics to
produce extrapyramidal side effects does not appear to be
explained by their 5-ht2a antagonism, although 5-ht1a
receptor and muscarinic receptor occupancy of some
drugs may be partially explanatory (talbot and laruelle
2002). an association has been postulated between
agonist activity at 5-ht1a receptors and anxiolytic or
antidepressant effects, improvements in cognitive and
negative symptoms, and decreased development of eps
in schizophrenia (millan 2000). a growing number of
studies show that stimulation of 5-ht1a receptors attenuates the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics.
for example,  xxxg1108xxx  activation attenuates
antipsychotic-induced side effects in humans (yoshida
et al. 1998), non-human primates (christoffersen and
meltzer 1998), antipsychotic-induced catalepsy in rats
(broekkamp et al. 1988; invernizzi et al. 1988; mcmillen
et al. 1988; wadenberg and ahlenius 1991; neal-beliveau et al. 1993; andersen and kilpatrick 1996; wadenberg 1996; prinssen et al. 1999, 2002), and appeared to
inhibit expression of  xxxg656xxx -mediated stereotypic
behaviors (piercey et al. 1994).
the increased interest in 5-ht1a receptors in antipsychotic research is evident by reports of novel antidopaminergic compounds with affinity at 5-ht1a
receptors (for references, see prinssen et al. 1999). more
recently, prinssen et al. (2000a) observed that the 5-ht1a
receptor antagonist way 100635 (forster et al. 1995)
enhanced antipsychotic-induced catalepsy in rats by
blocking tonic  xxxg1108xxx  activation. this 5-ht1a
receptor activation appears to result from tonic 5-ht
release, because dopamine receptor antagonists do not

enhance 5-ht levels (ferre and artigas 1995; assie et al.
1997). importantly, it was found that the inhibitory effect
of the  xxxg1108xxx  agonist 8-oh-dpat on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats does not show tolerance
(prinssen et al. 2000b). this finding suggests that mixed
 xxxg1108xxx  agonist/dopamine d2 antagonist compounds may have a low propensity to produce eps not
only after acute, but also after chronic administration.
a most interesting finding from this study is that,
although aripiprazole fully mimicked the highly selective
5-ht1a agonist ly 293284 in the drug discrimination
assay, it did not produce any component of the 5-ht
syndrome, even at the relatively high dose of 16 mg/kg.
thus, although efficacy of aripiprazole against the
positive symptoms of schizophrenia may be related to
its dopamine receptor interactions, it seems possible that
its atypical profile may derive, at least in part, from its  xxxg1108xxx  agonist effect, rather than from unusual  xxxg656xxx 
properties. we therefore wish to emphasize the potential
importance of  xxxg1108xxx  stimulation in the pharmacological profile of atypical antipsychotics such as
aripiprazole, clozapine, ziprasidone, and olanzapine and
suggest that more extensive studies appear warranted.
