regulation of linear bone growth in children and adolescents comprises a complex interaction of hormones and growth
factors. growth hormone (gh) is considered to be the key hormone regulator of linear growth in childhood. the
pubertal increase in growth velocity associated with gh has traditionally been attributed to testicular androgen
secretion in boys, and to oestrogens or adrenal androgen secretion in girls. research data indicating that oestrogen
may be the principal hormone stimulating the pubertal growth spurt in boys as well as girls is reviewed. such an action
is mediated by oestrogen receptors (er-a and er-b) in the human growth plate, and polymorphisms in the er gene
may in¯uence adult height in healthy subjects. prepubertal  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations are signi®cantly higher in girls
than in boys, explaining sex-related differences in pubertal onset. men with a disruptive mutation in the er gene
(oestrogen resistance) or in the  xxxg574xxx  gene (aromatase de®ciency) who have no pubertal growth spurt and continue to
grow into adulthood due to lack of epiphyseal fusion supports this notion. furthermore, phenotypic females with
complete androgen insensitivity syndrome have a normal female growth spurt despite lack of androgen action.
oestrogens may also in¯uence linear bone growth indirectly via modulation of the gh-insulin-like growth factor-i
( xxxg1144xxx ) axis. thus, er blockade diminishes endogenous gh secretion,  xxxg183xxx  (ar) blockade increases gh
secretion in peripubertal boys, and non-aromatizable androgens [ xxxd2806xxx  or dihydrotestosterone (dht)] have no
effect on gh secretion. treatment with aromatase inhibitors reduces circulating  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations in healthy
males, and reduces growth in boys with testotoxicosis. taken together, these ®ndings suggest that oestrogens may, in
addition to their direct effects, stimulate gh secretion and thereby increase circulating  xxxg1144xxx , which in turn may
stimulate growth. thus, oestrogens have important biphasic actions on longitudinal growth in boys as well as in girls.
very low levels of oestrogens may stimulate bone growth without affecting sexual maturation directly at the growth
plate as well as through stimulation of the gh-igf axis, which in turn may stimulate growth. conversely, higher levels
of oestrogens stimulate secondary sexual characteristics and epiphyseal fusion.

introduction
the importance of oestrogens for female physiology is well
established. furthermore, the importance of oestrogens in male
cardiovascular and bone physiology has been recognized recently.

oestrogens appear to be involved in the regulation of linear
growth in children and adolescents of both sexes, but the diversity
in mechanisms as well as sites of action leave many questions
unanswered.
regulation of linear bone growth in children and adolescents
comprises a complex interaction of hormones and growth factors.
traditionally, growth hormone (gh) is considered to be the key
hormone regulating linear growth in childhood. the pubertal
increase in growth velocity associated with increased gh
secretion has traditionally been attributed to testicular androgen
secretion in boys, and to oestrogens or adrenal androgen secretion
in girls. however, within the past decade, research has indicated
that oestrogen may be the principal hormone stimulating the
pubertal growth spurt in boys as well as girls.
historically, oestrogens were supposed to have a growthrepressive role due to closure of epiphyses. in addition to their
effects at the growth plate, oestrogens were believed to switch off

303

a.juul
gh secretion, and consequently acromegalic patients were treated
with oestrogens in the 1940s, with remarkable effects. this led to
the treatment of adolescent girls presenting with extreme tall
stature with high doses of oestrogen in the 1950s. treatment with
high doses of oestrogens has proven bene®cial in terms of ®nal
height outcome in girls with constitutional tall stature, although
lower doses compared with the initial studies have comparable
growth-inhibiting effects, with fewer side effects (drop et al.,
1998). in 1965, it was ®rst reported that oestrogen administration
at even lower doses was able to increase gh secretion in healthy
adults (frantz and rabkin, 1965), arguing that previous
hypotheses of oestrogens repressing gh secretion was wrong.
since then, the biphasic role of oestrogens on gh secretion has
been acknowledged.
in the present review potential mechanisms by which
oestrogens may exert their effect on longitudinal growth in
children will be discussed.

longitudinal growth in children
the growth pattern during the prepubertal years is characterized
by a relatively constant rate, averaging 5±6 cm per year in both
sexes. prepubertal growth is dependent on normal gh secretion,
nutritional and psychosocial factors as well as thyroid hormones.
the stable prepubertal growth rate diminishes to a `preadolescent
dip' just before the onset of puberty, whereafter abrupt changes in
growth occur. the pubertal onset corresponds to a bone age
(biological age) of 11 years in girls, and approximately 13 years
in boys. peak height velocity (phv) is reached at 12 years of age
in girls (mean phv 9 cm per year), and at 14 years in boys (mean
phv 10.3 cm per year) (marshall and tanner, 1969, 1970). the
pubertal growth spurt contributes more than 15% to the ®nal
height of the individual, and more than doubles the growth rate in
prepubertal children when they start sexual maturation. at the
same time, epiphyseal fusion is initiated which subsequently
terminates linear bone growth. when the epiphyses are closed
(fused), growth cannot be further stimulated thereafter. the
combination of a longer prepubertal growth period and a higher
phv in males results in their attainment of higher ®nal height
compared with females. development of secondary sexual
characteristics is dependent on adrenal androgens (adrenarche)
and on gonadal steroids, i.e. testosterone from the testicular
leydig cells in males, and on ovarian  xxxd2037xxx  production in
females. the gonadal production of steroids is stimulated by the
pulsatile secretion of gonadotrophins from the pituitary. in
puberty, increased secretion of lh and fsh, especially at
night-time, may be responsible for the very early activation of
the gonads. consequently, increased 24-h gonadotrophin secretion is detectable before physical signs of puberty are apparent
(demir et al., 1996; mitamura et al., 1999).

oestrogens in healthy children
 xxxd2037xxx  serum concentrations in healthy children

early oestrogen assays were those that quantitated biological
effects of oestrogens, such as vaginal corni®cation, vaginal
metabolic activity, vaginal epithelial thickening or uterine weight.
 xxxd2037xxx  concentrations have been determined by conventional

304

radioimmunoassays in healthy children in numerous studies. the
®rst reports on  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations in serum from prepubertal children by radioimmunoassays were published in the
1970s, with mean concentrations ranging from 22 to 41 pmol/l,
and with apparently similar concentrations in prepubertal boys
and girls (jenner et al., 1972; bidlingmaier et al., 1973;
angsusingha et al., 1974; baker et al., 1976; ducharme et al.,
1976). however, as the reported concentrations were very close to
the detection limit of the assays, they may represent assay
background values, and the results are therefore questionable.
moreover, it appeared that  xxxd2037xxx  was measurable in all
prepubertal serum samples, which is likely to be due to an
erroneous overestimation of the actual concentrations. further
developments have improved the sensitivities of the commercially
available immunoassays, but many problems remain. for
example, in a large proportion of samples from prepubertal
children the  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations are below the detection
limit of current commercially available  xxxd2037xxx  assays. in
prepubertal boys aged 6±8 years, 85% had values below the
detection limit of the assay (18 pmol/l) (andersson et al., 1997),
whereas 60% of prepubertal girls aged 6±8 years had undetectable
 xxxd2037xxx  concentrations using this assay (sehested et al., 2000).
especially, in cord blood and infancy such immunoassays may
overestimate the concentrations of  xxxd2037xxx  due to cross-reaction
with multiple pregnancy-associated steroids. thus, chromatographic separation of the steroid fractions before the analysis of
 xxxd2037xxx  seems mandatory in cord serum, neonates and infants
(figure 1).
it has been suggested that oestrogens exert biological effects at
concentrations below the detection limit of conventional immunoassays; this was illustrated by the `undetectable'  xxxd2037xxx 
concentrations determined by a commercially available assay, in
girls presenting with thelarche (breast development) (garibaldi
et al., 1993). in support of this hypothesis is a recent report (using
an ultrasensitive oestrogen assay; see below) detailing increased
 xxxd2037xxx  concentrations in girls with premature thelarche
compared with unaffected girls (klein et al., 1999). moreover,
the pubertal growth spurt precedes normal breast development in
girls (marshall and tanner, 1969), which may suggest that
increased growth occurs at even lower concentrations of
circulating oestrogens compared with development of secondary
sexual characteristics. the hypothesis of oestrogens being
biologically active at very low concentrations cannot be
con®rmed by the use of conventional immunoassays, though
with the advent of an ultrasensitive oestrogen assay this may now
be possible.
ultrasensitive oestrogen assay

in 1994, klein and co-workers reported almost 100-fold lower
 xxxd2037xxx  concentrations in prepubertal children when determined by an ultrasensitive oestrogen assay compared with
previously reported concentrations. these authors reported on
an ultrasensitive recombinant cell bioassay for oestrogen using a
yeast strain transformed with plasmids containing the human
 xxxg730xxx  (er) dna and an oestrogen response
element (klein et al., 1994). this assay has a detection limit of
0.07 pmol/l, and is relatively speci®c for  xxxd2037xxx . interestingly,
by the use of this assay, signi®cantly lower  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations were reported in prepubertal children (mean concentrations

et al., 2000).

of 0.03 pmol/l in prepubertal boys). moreover, signi®cantly
higher  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations were reported in prepubertal girls
(mean 1.3 pmol/l) compared with prepubertal boys (approximately 8-fold higher) (figure 2).
these differences have not previously been detectable using
conventional immunoassays, and may well explain the earlier
onset of increased growth, earlier pubertal signs and greater rate
of skeletal maturation observed in girls compared with boys.
thus, use of ultrasensitive oestrogen assays may be necessary
when associations between circulating oestrogens and longitudinal growth is studied.
pulsatility of  xxxd2037xxx  secretion in children

another factor which has made evaluation of the correlation
between oestrogens and growth dif®cult, is the pulsatile nature of
oestrogen secretion in healthy children.  xxxd2037xxx  is secreted in a
pulsatile manner, and this pulsatility is accentuated with the onset
of puberty. several authors have demonstrated the pulsatile nature
of circulating  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations in early-pubertal girls and
boys (goji, 1993; norjavaara et al., 1996; albertsson-wikland
et al., 1997). thus, determination of  xxxd2037xxx  on single blood
samples may not be representative of 24-h oestrogen secretion,
and thereby not representative of the potential endocrine
oestrogen exposure to the growth plate.
endogenous oestrogen and longitudinal growth in children

several studies have studied the association between a single
circulating  xxxd2037xxx  concentration and growth velocity in
healthy children. in a study of healthy girls,  xxxd2037xxx 
concentrations were signi®cantly associated with growth velocity
(goji, 1993; norjavaara et al., 1996). with the use of the
ultrasensitive oestrogen assay, the rise in  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations correlated with phv in a longitudinal study of 23 normally
growing boys who progressed through puberty (klein et al.,
1996). the oestrogen concentration correlated positively with
growth velocity before the time of phv, and negatively with

figure 2. serum concentrations of  xxxd2037xxx  equivalents in normal
prepubertal boys and girls. error bars represent sd. *p < 0.05 versus
concentrations in boys. (figure reproduced from klein et al., 1994, with
permission from american society of clinical investigation.)

growth velocity after phv. this study is consistent with the
hypothesis that oestrogen at low concentrations augments skeletal
growth and maturation in boys and girls, and that continued
exposure to oestrogen leads to epiphyseal fusion.
thus, many of the problems from previous studies which have
evaluated endogenous oestrogens in relation to growth rates may
be overcome by the use of an ultrasensitive  xxxd2037xxx  assay and
further optimized if the pulsatile nature of  xxxd2037xxx  secretion is
also taken into account.

direct effects of oestrogens on growth
the growth plate consists of chondrocytes which are organized in
distinct layers. the chondroblast progenitor cells form the reserve

305

zone in the epiphysis. according to the dual effector theory
(green et al., 1985), these resting chondrocytes are primed by gh,
which prepares them for clonal expansion under the in¯uence of
insulin-like growth factor-i ( xxxg1144xxx ) (isaksson et al., 1982) and
form columns in the proliferative zone. the proliferative
chondrocytes are subsequently differentiated to hypertrophic
chondrocytes, which secrete matrix to be mineralized. as gh
and  xxxg1144xxx  receptors are not con®ned to resting chondrocytes, but
are present on resting as well as on proliferative and hypertrophic
chondrocytes, it is currently believed that gh and  xxxg1144xxx  exert
effects at each stage of chondrocyte differentiation. the
chondrocytes in the hypertrophic zone then undergo apoptosis,
and thereafter vascularization and invasion of osteoblasts occurs
which closes the growth plate (epiphyseal fusion).

been linked to height in adult females (lehrer et al., 1994),
suggesting an impact of er gene polymorphisms on height
attainment in otherwise healthy individuals.

presence of er in the human growth plate

to date, three men with tall stature due to genetic mutations that
lead to lack of oestrogen action have been described, and these
cases have dramatically expanded our understanding of the
importance of oestrogens in the regulation of linear growth (for
review, see grumbach and auchus, 1999). one man with a
disruptive er-a gene mutation was reported in 1994 (smith et al.,
1994), and one year later a man with similar phenotypic
appearance due to a mutation in the aromatase gene ( xxxg574xxx )
leading to undetectable  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations was described
(morishima et al., 1995). a similar case of a tall-statured male
with oestrogen de®ciency due to a aromatase gene mutation was
reported later (carani et al., 1997).

a prerequisite for a direct oestrogen action at the level of the
growth plate is the presence of er on chondrocytes in the growth
plate. traditionally, oestrogens are thought to act exclusively
through intracellular steroid receptors which act to stimulate or
inhibit gene expression in target tissues at a relatively slow rate.
two distinct types of er (er-a and er-b) exist, both of which
stimulate gene expression by activating protein (ap)-1 sites,
though with opposite effects when liganded with  xxxd2037xxx . both
receptor types have been localized to the human growth plate;
er-a have been localized in all zones of the growth plate, i.e.
resting, proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes (kusec et al.,
1998), whereas er-b were expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes exclusively (nilsson et al., 1999).
the current understanding of how oestrogens may affect
growth is as follows. oestrogens (at low concentrations) stimulate
gh secretion through binding to intracellular er, and may
subsequently stimulate chondrocyte growth in the proliferation
zone, but may also potentiate clonal expansion. by contrast, high
doses of oestrogens inhibit clonal expansion, and cell proliferation
in the hypertrophic zone. furthermore, high concentrations of
oestrogens induce apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes, and
stimulate osteoblast invasion in the growth plate. the discrepant
localization of the er subtypes on chondrocytes may suggest
separate roles for the er-a and er-b in er-mediated effects on
bone growth and maturation, although this is speculative.
furthermore, oestrogens also act through non-genomic pathways
that mediate rapid effects of oestrogens in certain tissues (moss
et al., 1997; revelli et al., 1998). whether or not the rapid nongenomic actions of oestrogens play a role for longitudinal growth
remains to be seen.
er gene polymorphism and growth

several polymorphisms in the er gene have been demonstrated,
and are related to osteoporosis, breast cancer susceptibility and
hypertension in normal ageing men and in postmenopausal
women (kobayashi et al., 1996; ongphiphadhanakul et al., 1998;
riggs et al., 1998). others (lorentzon et al., 1999) studied er
gene polymorphism in 17-year-old boys in relation to their bone
mineral density. interestingly, a signi®cant in¯uence of the pvuii
genotype on height was demonstrated. these authors found that
20 boys with the pp genotype (homozygous) were signi®cantly
taller compared with boys with the other allelic variants
(lorentzon et al., 1999). also er-a gene polymorphisms have

306

androgen insensitivity and growth

supporting the importance of oestrogens for the pubertal growth
spurt is the fact that phenotypic (46,xy) females with complete
androgen insensitivity syndrome (cais) have a normal (female)
pubertal growth spurt despite a complete lack of androgen action.
their pubertal growth spurt is quantitatively normal, and the age
of phv was comparable with that of normal females (zachman
et al., 1986).

oestrogen-de®ciency syndromes

er gene mutation and growth

in 1994, a man with complete lack of oestrogen action due to a
disruptive mutation in the er-a gene was reported (smith et al.,
1994). this man with oestrogen resistance had normal birth
weight, and had experienced a normal prepubertal growth, had a
normal onset of secondary sexual characteristics, bilateral axillary
acanthosis nigricans, osteopenia and hyperinsulinaemia. he had
high  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations, as well as high fsh and lh
concentrations (33 iu/l and 37 iu/l respectively). despite normal
masculinization, epiphyseal fusion had not occurred and he
continued to grow as an adult. he had no recollection of increased
growth at the time of pubertal development, which is also
apparent from his growth chart (figure 3). at 28 years of age the
man was 204 cm tall, and presented to an orthopaedic surgeon due
to continued growth and progressive genu valgum. because
radiological evaluation demonstrated a bone age of 15 years, he
was further evaluated. a homozygous mutation in exon 2 in the
er-a gene, with a substitution of thymine with cytosine resulting
in a premature stop codon (tga) instead of an arginine codon
(cga) was demonstrated, leaving him totally oestrogen-resistant
(smith et al., 1994). for the ®rst time it was possible to evaluate
the role of testosterone on growth and epiphyseal fusion in the
absence of oestrogen action in a male. to date, this is the only
report of a patient with a disruptive mutation in the er-gene.
aromatase gene ( xxxg574xxx ) mutations and growth

conversion of c19 steroids to oestrogens is catalysed by the
aromatase enzyme (p450arom), which belongs to the cytochrome
p450 superfamily. p450arom is encoded by the  xxxg574xxx  gene, and
localized in a variety of tissues such as the ovary, testis, placenta,
testis, fat tissue, in various parts of the brain as well as in bone

et al., 1994 and morishima et al., 1995.)

tissue. to date, nine patients with aromatase gene mutations have
been described in the literature of which three are males (two
adult males and one infant boy). the ®rst patient with aromatase
de®ciency was described in 1994, a girl who at 14 years of age
had high concentrations of androgens and low concentrations of
oestrogens. she presented with no breast development, no
menarche, abundant pubic and axillary hair, enlarged clitoris
and short stature with no pubertal growth spurt and delayed bone
age. following oestrogen supplementation she had a remarkable
growth spurt, illustrating the importance of oestrogens for the
female growth spurt (conte et al., 1994).
in 1995, aromatase de®ciency in male and female siblings was
reported (morishima et al., 1995); these siblings were from a
pedigree indicating a consanguineous marriage between the
paternal great great grandfather and his second wife's sister. a
point mutation [bp 1123(c®t)] in exon ix of the  xxxg574xxx  gene
which results in a cysteine instead of arginine in position 375
(r375c) was demonstrated. the clinical features of the affected
sister were similar to the girl described by others (conte et al.,
1994). the affected brother was 24 years of age when ®rst
examined; he was 204 cm (+3.7 sd), and presented with a bone
age of 14 years. his clinical characteristics are shown in table i.
as seen from figure 3, no pubertal growth spurt was apparent,
and he continued to grow in adulthood.
a similar case was reported in 1997 (carani et al., 1997) in
which a patient was ®rst evaluated at the age of 29 years due to
infertility (sperm count <106/ml), and subsequently treated with
human  xxxd2228xxx  (hcg) for 4 months, without

effect. at the age of 31 years the patient was further evaluated
because of continued linear growth, infertility and skeletal pain,
especially in the knee (table i). at the age of 38 years, he was
190 cm (>97th percentile) and his bone age had not changed
(figure 3). he was also found to have a point mutation in the
 xxxg574xxx  gene [bp 1094 (g®a)]. both these aromatase-de®cient
men had undetectable  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations, and relatively
high testosterone concentrations (table i). administration of
 xxxd2037xxx  resulted in fusion of the epiphyses with cessation of
linear growth, and the skeletal pain stopped (carani et al, 1997;
bilezkian et al, 1998). a recent dose-®nding study suggests an
appropriate substitution dose of 25 mg/day of transdermal
 xxxd2037xxx  to maintain both bone mass and normal a  xxxd2037xxx 
concentration in a man with aromatase de®ciency (rochira et al.,
2000).
thus, men with lack of oestrogen action due to either oestrogen
resistance or to lack of oestrogen production, has provided
valuable insight into the physiological importance of oestrogens
in male growth.

oestrogen-excess syndromes
precocious puberty

children with idiopathic precocious puberty (cpp) of central
origin are predominantly of the female sex. there is no apparent
explanation for this difference according to gender. children with
cpp are characterized by a marked increase in growth velocity,
gh secretion and  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations due to elevated  xxxd2037xxx

concentrations (juul et al., 1995). the increased growth often
begins 1±2 years before physical signs of puberty. in the untreated
state these children end up being very short due to early fusion of
the epiphyses (sigurjonsdottir and hayles, 1968). however, when
treated appropriately with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone
(gnrh) agonists by which gonadal suppression is achieved, a
signi®cant decline in the accelerated growth is obtained and the
rate of bone maturation, gh secretion and  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations
are decreased, and as a result ®nal height is markedly improved
(heger et al., 1999). moreover, a quantitatively normal pubertal
growth spurt has been reported in patients with cpp who were
also gh-de®cient (attie et al., 1990), indicating a direct role of
oestrogens, not mediated by gh, in the pubertal growth spurt.
oestrogen suppression by aromatase inhibitors

familial gonadotrophin-independent male precocious puberty
(testotoxicosis) is a condition of a constitutively activating
mutation in the  xxxg1325xxx ; this leads to continuous activation
of the  xxxg1325xxx , resulting in high testosterone concentrations
despite low gonadotrophin concentrations. these boys experience
increased growth in addition to their sexual precocity. both
blockade with an anti-androgen (spironolactone) and inhibition of
aromatase activity with  xxxd3324xxx  alone were unsatisfactory in
reverting the skeletal growth to the prepubertal rate in these
patients, while a combination of these two drugs was effective in
restoring the growth rate (laue et al., 1989), suggesting that
aromatization of the increased leydig cell production of
testosterone is important for the increased growth rate in these
boys. on the other hand, it showed that the effect of testosterone
on growth may not be purely oestrogenic.
oestrogen suppression in adult males with a new potent
aromatase inhibitor (arimidex;  xxxd173xxx , astrazeneca,
wilmington, de, usa) resulted in a signi®cant reduction in
circulating concentrations of  xxxg1144xxx  without any effect on gh
secretion (mauras et al., 2000). future studies should evaluate if
the clinical use of aromatase inhibitors is valuable when trying to
increase the height potential of short-statured boys by delaying
epiphyseal fusion.
aromatase excess

more than 20 years ago, the extragonadal, extra-adrenal
production of oestrogen was quanti®ed in men and women

308

(siiteri and macdonald, 1973), opening the possibility of locally
produced oestrogen having local actions. aromatases are present
in numerous tissues, including human bone tissue (sasano et al.,
1997), and therefore local production of  xxxd2037xxx  from
aromatized androgens within the growth plate could have
important local auto- or paracrine actions on longitudinal growth.
boys with aromatase excess syndrome, in which inappropriately high peripheral aromatase expression (and thereby increased
conversion of testosterone to  xxxd2037xxx ) leads to feminization
(gynaecomastia) are also characterized by increased longitudinal
growth as well as bone maturation. in these boys, elevated
circulating concentrations of  xxxd2037xxx  and oestrogen precursors
were reported (hemsell et al., 1977; bulun et al., 1997; sher et al.,
1998; stratakis et al., 1998). boys with idiopathic gynaecomastia
are generally of tall stature, and characterized by relative obesity
(sher et al., 1998). as adipose tissue and muscle are important
sites for extraglandular aromatase activity, it is possible that these
individuals have a higher than average conversion of androgens to
oestrogens, responsible for their gynaecomastia and increased
linear growth. similarly, increased growth and gynaecomastia
was reported in three boys with peutz±jeghers syndrome due to
increased aromatase expression in oestrogen-secreting testicular
tumours (coen et al., 1991; bulun et al., 1993).

indirect effects of oestrogens on growth
oestrogens have indirect actions on growth via the entire gh-igf
axis.
endogenous sex steroids and gh secretion

er-a and er-b are present in the pituitary gland, as well as in the
hypothalamic preoptic area. in the pituitary gland, the er-a
predominates, whereas er-b predominates in the preoptic area
(shughrue et al., 1997).
prepubertal girls have higher mean 24-h gh concentrations or
total gh secretory rate compared with prepubertal boys in most
(costin et al., 1989; merimee et al., 1991; veldhuis et al., 2000),
but not all (albertsson-wikland et al., 1994) studies, which may
suggest that very low concentrations of oestrogens in prepubertal
girls could stimulate gh secretion. in puberty, the pulsatile gh
secretion increases 2- to 3-fold, with girls increasing 1±2 years
before boys (rose et al., 1991; albertsson-wikland et al., 1994),

oestrogen and linear bone growth
which is likely to be due to stimulation of the hypothalamopituitary axis by sex steroids. in young healthy menstruating
females, mean gh concentrations were higher compared with
young healthy males (ho et al., 1987). similar ®ndings were
reported in another study in which the higher mean gh
concentrations in females were found to be largely due to an
amplitude-speci®c divergence in the pulsatile mode of gh
secretion (van den berg et al., 1997). furthermore, the in¯uence
of  xxxd2037xxx  on integrated gh secretion is evidenced by the
®nding of higher gh concentrations in the late follicular phase of
the menstrual cycle, when  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations are high
compared with the early follicular and luteal phases (faria et al.,
1992). in pre- and postmenopausal women, oral oestrogen
administration stimulates gh secretion (dawson-hughes et al.,
1986; weissberger et al., 1991; bellantoni et al., 1996; friend
et al., 1996). not only does  xxxd2037xxx  affect gh secretion, but the
metabolic clearance of gh also seems to be dependent on
 xxxd2037xxx  concentrations (the half-life is positively associated
with  xxxd2037xxx ) in men (holl et al., 1993).
signi®cant correlations between  xxxd2037xxx , but not testosterone, and integrated gh secretion have been reported in adult
males (ho et al., 1987). in peripubertal males, testosterone
stimulated the pulsatile release of gh, but  xxxd2806xxx  (a
synthetic derivative of testosterone which does not aromatize to
 xxxd2037xxx ) did not affect integrated gh secretion (link et al.,
1986). this may be due to the dose used, or alternatively to the
fact that aromatization of androgens is important for the
stimulatory effect on pituitary gh release. similarly, testosterone,
but not dihydrotestosterone (dht), stimulated the pituitary gh
secretion and disorderliness of gh release ( xxxg171xxx ) in boys with
constitutionally delayed puberty, suggesting the necessity for
aromatization of androgen to modify pituitary gh output
(veldhuis et al., 1997). interestingly, therapy with testosterone
as well as with dht for 2.5 months in boys with constitutional
delay in growth and adolescence, stimulated height velocity into
the peak pubertal range, without an increase in gh secretion or
 xxxg1144xxx  (keenan et al., 1993). this suggests that gh may not be the
primary regulator of the increased growth in puberty.
effect of sex steroid receptor blockade on gh secretion

three days of treatment with ¯utamide ( xxxd2143xxx ; schering corp.,
kenilworth, nj, usa), a potent non-steroidal competitive
inhibitor of binding of androgen to its receptor, enhanced 24-h
mean serum gh concentration and enhanced gh production,
without alteration in metabolic clearance of gh, in six late
pubertal males.  xxxd2143xxx  had no effect on  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations,
however (metzger and kerrigan, 1993). the stimulatory effect of
¯utamide on gh secretion may occur as a result of increased
stimulation of er-mediated pathways during ar blockade.
alternatively, androgens may exert a tonic inhibition of gh
secretion which can be abolished by ar blockade.
conversely, er blockade with tamoxifen (nolvadex; ici
pharma, wilmington, de, usa) signi®cantly diminished the
endogenous gh secretion in 10 late pubertal males after 4 days of
treatment (metzger and kerrigan, 1994) in normal adult males, as
well as in testosterone-treated hypogonadal males (weissberger
and ho, 1993). this supports the importance of oestrogens for the
stimulation of endogenous pituitary gh secretion in males.
tamoxifen signi®cantly decreased  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations in 68

healthy middle-aged women participating in a primary breast
cancer prevention trial (decensi et al., 1999), as well as in
pubertal boys (metzger and kerrigan, 1994) and adult men
(weissberger and ho, 1993). thus, er blockade down-regulates
the entire gh±igf axis.
effects of oestrogen administration on  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations

in general, it is believed that  xxxg1144xxx  serum concentrations are
stimulated by sex steroids due to an increased gh secretion.
however, direct effects of sex steroids (oestrogens in particular)
on the hepatic (as well as locally produced)  xxxg1144xxx  secretion,
which is not mediated by gh, are probably also important. the
effect of oestrogen administration to healthy adult women on
 xxxg1144xxx  is dependent on route. several studies have demonstrated
decreasing serum  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations after administration of
oral oestrogens (despite increased integrated gh secretion), but
unchanged or even increasing serum  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations after
transdermal or intranasal administration of oestrogens (dall'aglio
et al., 1994; bellantoni et al., 1996; raudaskoski et al., 1998;
garnero et al., 1999; vestergaard et al., 1999). moreover,  xxxg1144xxx 
generation following a single dose of gh was signi®cantly lower
in elderly females who were receiving oral oestrogen therapy
compared with untreated females (lieberman et al., 1994).
as oral and dermal administration of oestrogens have similar
ef®cacy in preventing postmenopausal bone loss, the differences
cannot be attributed to different `oestrogenicity' of the differently
administered oestrogen compounds, but rather to hepatic ®rst-pass
effects of orally administered oestrogens on hepatic  xxxg1144xxx 
production. in hypopituitary gh-de®cient women, oral administration of oestrogens resulted in a signi®cant decrease in  xxxg1144xxx ,
insulin-like growth factor binding protein (igfbp)-3 and acidlabile subunit (als), suggesting direct hepatic effects of
oestrogens on  xxxg1144xxx  generation (cook et al., 1999; kam et al.,
2000; span et al., 2000). furthermore, a switch from oral to
transdermal  xxxd2037xxx  therapy increased serum  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations in gh-substituted gh-de®cient women (cook et al., 1999;
janssen et al., 2000).
in summary, puberty is characterized by dynamic interactions
between the gh±igf axis and gonadal steroids. although these
hormones exert independent action on skeletal growth and
development of secondary sexual characteristics, their interaction
is crucial for normal growth and development. the role of
androgens versus oestrogens on the pubertal stimulation of gh
secretion has been studied intensively, and it is now believed that
the facilitatory role of er-mediated processes on pituitary gh
secretion is of major importance. it is believed that oestrogens
modulate the basal, entropic and rhythmic modalities of gh
secretion, which in turn affects  xxxg1144xxx  secretion. in addition, direct
actions on hepatic  xxxg1144xxx  production have been shown. whether or
not these changes in the gh-igf axis are of importance for the
pubertal growth spurt remains controversial.

effects of oestrogen therapy on growth
turner syndrome girls

several drugs have been used to improve linear growth in turner
syndrome such as gh, anabolic steroids ( xxxd2806xxx ; btg
pharmaceutical, iselin, nj, usa) and oestrogens, as well as

309

a.juul
various combination therapies. initial studies of oestrogen therapy
in turner syndrome girls indicated a biphasic dose±response
relationship between oestrogen and short-term ulnar growth (ross
et al., 1983). ulnar growth, as determined by a device consisting
of a ®xing apparatus which immobilizes the forearm in a
reproducible manner, was determined 4 weeks after beginning
the oestrogen treatment. the authors showed that maximal growth
was stimulated at a dose of 100 ng/kg per day ethinyl  xxxd2037xxx 
(ee) (equivalent to 4 mg ee/day in a 40 kg girl), which is well
below the doses conventionally used to induce puberty. higher
doses resulted in no stimulation of ulnar growth compared with
baseline. interestingly, the stimulatory effect of the low-dose ee
occurred without any signi®cant sexual maturation or circulating
 xxxg1144xxx  concentrations in these girls (ross et al., 1983). using a
similar low-dose ee approach in a subsequent 6-month trial of 16
turner syndrome girls resulted in sustained signi®cant increases
in growth rate, with the majority of the girls experiencing no
breast development (ross et al., 1986). in line with this ®nding,
others (rosen®eld et al., 1998) demonstrated that low-dose depot
 xxxd2037xxx  administration to nine patients with turner syndrome
(aged 12±15 years) resulted in an increase of 5.8 cm in ®nal
height, as predicted by the bailey-pinneau method (bailey and
pinneau, 1962). in this study, oestrogen was administered as
intramuscular depot  xxxd2037xxx , using a starting dose of 0.2 mg/
month, this being increased at 6-month intervals to 0.4, 0.6 and
0.8 mg/month (rosen®eld et al., 1998). however, others found
that bone age advancement during 18 months of oestrogen
therapy precluded any effect on ®nal height using equally lowdose ee regimens (2±4 mg/day) compared with the initial shortterm studies (martinez et al., 1987). furthermore, addition of
extremely low doses of oral ee (0.25±1.0 mg/day) to daily
subcutaneous gh administration had no bene®cial effect on
growth velocity in 40 girls with turner syndrome
(vanderschueren-lodeweyckx et al., 1990). thus, controversy
exists on whether or not it is possible to promote growth at an
earlier age without affecting sexual maturation using a proper
timing as well as low-dose oestrogen therapy in turner syndrome
girls. however, the important issue is the potential effect on ®nal
height. a recent study clearly demonstrated bene®cial effects on
®nal height in turner syndrome girls treated with gh, when the
introduction of oestrogen supplementation was postponed to 15
years of age. on the other hand, late pubertal maturation may
affect the psychosocial development as well as bone mineral
density of the patient, which is why earlier introduction of gh is
recommended, combined with low-dose oestrogen that will bring
the patient into the normal range for pubertal age (chernausek
et al., 2000).
healthy boys

in early pubertal boys constant intravenous infusions of ee were
given (4, 20 or 90 mg/day) for 4 days in a cross-over study, and
ulnar growth was registered over the following 3-week periods
(caruso-nicoletti et al., 1985). it was demonstrated that the lowdose ee (4 mg/day) signi®cantly increased ulnar growth compared
with the baseline situation, whereas the two higher doses did not
signi®cantly alter short-term growth rate (figure 4).
by contrast, circulating  xxxg1144xxx  concentrations were not changed
during the low-dose period, whereas signi®cant elevations were
reported only during intermediate or high doses of ee which

failed to induce signi®cant changes in growth rate. this speaks in
favour of direct oestrogen action at the level of the growth plate
(independent of circulating  xxxg1144xxx ), but it cannot be excluded that
locally produced  xxxg1144xxx  may contribute to the effect of  xxxd2037xxx 
on growth.

conclusions
in summary, data exist to support a hypothesis of direct, as well as
indirect, effects of oestrogens on longitudinal bone growth:
1. oestrogen receptors are present in the human growth plate,
and polymorphism in the er gene in¯uences adult height in
healthy subjects.
2. prepubertal  xxxd2037xxx  concentrations are signi®cantly higher
in girls compared with boys when determined by an ultrasensitive
assay, explaining differences in pubertal onset between boys and
girls.
3. men with a disruptive mutation in the er gene (oestrogen
resistance) or in the  xxxg574xxx  gene (aromatase de®ciency) have no
pubertal growth spurt, and continue to grow into adulthood due to
lack of epiphyseal fusion.
4. phenotypic females with complete androgen insensitivity
syndrome have a normal female growth spurt, despite lack of
androgen action.
5. er blockade diminishes endogenous gh secretion, and ar
blockade increases gh secretion in peripubertal boys, and nonaromatizable androgens ( xxxd2806xxx  or dht) have no effect on
gh secretion.
6. treatment with aromatase inhibitors reduces circulating
 xxxg1144xxx  concentrations in healthy males, and reduces growth in
boys with testotoxicosis.
7. low-dose ee treatment (4 mg/day as constant intravenous
infusion) results in elevated ulnar growth in turner syndrome
girls, as well as in healthy peripubertal boys; in contrast, high
doses inhibit growth, supporting the biphasic dose-response
relation between pubertal growth and oestrogens.
thus, oestrogens are important for normal pubertal growth in
boys as well as in girls. very low concentrations of oestrogens
may also stimulate bone growth without affecting sexual
maturation directly at the growth plate, through stimulation of
the gh±igf axis, whereas higher concentrations of oestrogens
stimulate secondary sexual characteristics and epiphyseal
fusion.
