staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) is commonly associated with microbial infection of
orthopaedic implants. such infections often lead to osteomyelitis, which may result in
failure of the implant due to localised bone destruction. bacterial adhesion and subsequent
colonisation of the device may occur as a consequence of contamination during surgery, or
by seeding from a distant site through the blood circulation. coating of the hydroxyapatite
(ha) ceramic component of artificial hip joints with the bisphosphonates  xxxd1721xxx  (c) and
 xxxd2837xxx  (p) has been proposed as a means to minimise osteolysis and thereby prevent
loosening of the implant. however, the effect of the bisphosphonate coating on bacterial
adhesion to the ha materials must be determined before this approach can be
implemented. in this study coated ha materials were incubated with the s. aureus and the
number of adherent bacteria determined using the modified vortex device (mvd) method.
the number of bacteria adherent to the p coated ha material was significantly greater than
that adherent to uncoated ha (60-fold increase) or to the c coated ha (90-fold increase).
therefore, even though earlier studies suggested that p bound to ha may improve
osseointegration, the results presented would suggest that the use of this coating may be
limited by the potential increased susceptibility of the coated device to infection.

1. introduction
bacterial adhesion has become a major concern for
many medical devices, including catheters, middle ear
implants and contact lenses [1–4]. it has, therefore, become important to develop materials for implantation
which are resistant to bacterial adhesion. orthopaedic
implants are also susceptible to microbial infections
and these are frequently due to staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) [5, 6]. such infections often lead to
osteomyelitis, which may result in failure of the implant due to localised bone destruction [7]. bacteria
can adhere to and colonise the material either by contamination during surgery or by seeding from a distant
site through the blood circulation [1]. it is therefore important to investigate the extent to which orthopaedic
materials resist or promote bacterial adhesion, and to
this end a modified vortex device (mvd) test method
was used to investigate bacterial adhesion to materials being developed for use on the surface of artificial hips. this method has previously been validated
as an alternative to the use of costly animal testing for
the assessment of bacterial adhesion to new contact

lens materials [4]. the method relies on a whirlpooltype force to remove bacteria adherent to the test
material.
osteolysis with concomitant loosening of the prosthesis is the most common cause of failure in total joint
arthroplasty and it is usually initiated by a number of
material, device, site and host specific biological and
mechanical events [8]. these include fragmentation and
wear of the implant materials, release of particles into
the tissue to provoke a foreign body reaction, stress
shielding due to stiffness mismatch between the implant
material and surrounding bone, and activation of cells to
produce a variety of cytokines and proteolytic enzymes.
it is therefore important to develop successful strategies
to minimise osteolysis, as these would reduce the costs
to both the patient and healthcare providers associated
with revision surgery to replace failed prostheses. bone
remodelling occurs continuously in the skeleton by the
co-ordinated actions of osteoblasts, which secrete new
matrix, and osteoclasts, which resorb old bone. as osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells are also activated during osteolysis, any agent which reduces the efficiency

of bone resorption, will inhibit the osteolysis associated
with prosthesis loosening.
the bisphosphonates are a group of stable pyrophosphate analogues characterised by a central carbon atom
linking two phosphate groups and two side chains of
variable structure (for examples see fig. 1). these
agents are known to be effective inhibitors of osteoclastic activity [9–16] and may therefore have a role to play
in reducing bone resorption. the properties and potency
of the bisphosphonates in inhibiting osteoclastic activity is determined by the nature of the side chains [17].
bisphosphonates are used therapeutically in a variety of
diseases of enhanced bone resorption, including paget’s
disease, hypercalcaemia of malignancy and osteoporosis, so there are data available for the efficiency, safety
and pharmacodynamics in humans following both oral
and intravenous administration [17].
bisphosphonates bind avidly to the bone mineral hydroxyapatite (ha), and are released during skeletal
remodelling (17). we propose that a coating of bisphosphonate on the ha ceramic component of artificial hip joints may inhibit osteolysis of the surrounding tissue, reduce the tendency towards loosening, and
therefore improve the lifetime of the implant. we have
recently reported that osteoblasts cultured on ha materials coated with bisphosphonates show increased synthesis of dna, protein and collagen compared with
cells cultured on uncoated ha [18]. this suggests that
bisphosphonate coating may improve osseointegration
of ha implants by also increasing osteoblast growth
and activity. however, before this approach can be implemented the effect of the bisphosphonate coating on
bacterial adhesion onto the ha materials must be determined. in this study ha materials coated with either
 xxxd1721xxx  (c) or  xxxd2837xxx  (p) were incubated with
s. aureus and the mvd used to determine the number of adherent bacteria associated with the different
materials. the structures of these drugs are shown in
fig. 1.

2. materials and methods
2.1. preparation of materials
sodium  xxxd1721xxx  ( xxxd1721xxx , boehringer ingelheim,
bracknell, berkshire, uk), and  xxxd2837xxx  (aredia,
284

ciba, camberley, surrey) were prepared as 0.22 m, and
0.038 m solutions in serum-free medium respectively.
to produce pellets of dense ha material (pore size
< 3 µm) 55 g of calcium phosphate powder (tribasic 34-4% ca) was mixed with 10 ml of 4% (w/v)
polyvinyl alcohol in distilled water. using an instron,
1 g of the mixture was placed in a compaction chamber and a pressure of 750 kg applied to produce 1 cm
× 0.5 cm dense pellets. the samples were then sintered at 1150 ◦ c for 2 h. after sintering, samples were
polished using silicone carbide paper, cleaned for 1 h
in 70% (v/v) alcohol, and then for a further 1h in distilled water at 37 ◦ c. a number of polished and cleaned
samples of the material were then coated with 4 ×
200 µl aliquots of either 3 mg/ml disodium  xxxd1721xxx 
or 1 mg/ml disodium  xxxd2837xxx  at room temperature.
the coated substrates were dried under a controlled,
constant heated airflow between each application. the
presence of the coating was confirmed using a joel jsm
6310 scanning electron microscope with an oxford
isis energy dispersive x-ray (edx) microanalysis attachment using an accelerating voltage of 20 kv.

2.2. bacterial adherence assay
an overnight culture (18 h) of s. aureus was prepared
in 100 ml of nutrient broth. the bacteria were washed
thrice. by reference to a standard optical density calibration curve the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of
sterile phosphate buffered saline (pbs) to a concentration of approximately 108 cells/ml. the coated and
uncoated samples of ha ceramics were equilibrated
with 2 ml of sterile pbs for 1 h, prior to placing the
samples into a 24 well plate. 1 ml of the bacterial suspension was added to each well and the plate incubated
at 37 ◦ c on a shaker at 120 rpm for 6 h.
on completion of the incubation the coated and uncoated ha ceramics were placed into a fresh 24-well
plate and repeatedly washed with 2 ml of sterile pbs
to remove any loosely adherent bacteria. each material
was then placed into 5 ml of sterile pbs and vortexed at
maximum power for 1minute to remove bacteria which
had adhered to the material. previous work has shown
that few bacteria remain attached to surfaces after this
vortex process [4]. 200 µl aliquots of the vortex solutions were serially diluted and plated in triplicate onto
tryptone soya agar (tsa) plates and incubated at 37 ◦ c
for 17 h. the colonies formed from the incubation solutions and vortex solutions were counted.

2.3. scanning electron microscopy
coated and uncoated samples of ha ceramic incubated with s. aureus were prepared for sem following
standard procedures. samples were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde at room temperature for 17 h. the samples
were then washed three times with cacodylate buffer
and dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol solutions (25, 50, 75, 95, 100%). the samples were subsequently freeze-dried, sputter coated with gold, and
observed using joel jsm 6310 scanning electron microscope.

scanning electron microscope with an oxford isis edx system at an accelerating voltage of 20 kv.

3. results
fig. 2 shows the edx spectra for the uncoated and
coated ha disks. the presence of chlorine in fig. 2(b)
and the enhanced carbon peak in fig. 2(c) confirm the
presence of  xxxd1721xxx  and  xxxd2837xxx  respectively
on the surface of the coated ha disks.
fig. 3 shows the bacterial colony forming units
(cfu) on the surface of the 3 different hydroxyapatite material discs, uncoated ha, ha coated with c
(hac) and ha coated with p (hap). the figure shows
that after 17 h of incubation on the tsa plates there
were greater quantities of bacteria present in the vortex solution for hap compared with the ha and hac
samples. there were 5 experiments which contained
triplicate samples, and these were termed “run 1–5”.

for the hap samples all 5 runs showed a significant
increase (p < 0.05; by anova followed by dunnett’s
test) in the number of bacteria which had attached to
the surface compared with the ha samples. the mean
cfu/cm2 for hap was 61125 compared with 961 for
ha and 702 for hac an increase of almost 60 and 90
fold, respectively.
examination by sem of the ha samples incubated
with s. aureus for 6 h clearly shows the presence of
bacterial colonies on the surface of the disks (fig. 4).

4. discussion
bacterial adhesion is a major problem in the medical
device field. many devices which can be put at risk

by recurrent infections, such as middle ear implants,
catheters, and contact lenses are routinely tested for susceptibility to bacterial adhesion and colonisation [1–4].
however, in the orthopaedic industry this type of testing
is often overlooked even though prosthesis-associated
infections represent a major clinical problem [5, 6]. s.
aureus is directly implicated in the localised bone destruction associated with infected orthopaedic implants
and bacterial arthritis [7]. it was therefore considered
important to study bacterial adhesion onto the uncoated
and bisphosphonate coated ha materials.
an adapted mvd method was used to determine bacterial adhesion, as this procedure has been used successfully to quantify adhesion to contact lens materials [4].
we used this method to quantify the number of adherent bacteria on the coated and uncoated ha materials.
the results showed that compared with ha and hac,
there is a dramatic 60–90 fold increase in the number
of bacteria which adhered to the hap material .
the adhesion of s. aureus to some surfaces has
been shown to be due to its ability to bind specific
host matrix proteins [6, 7]. the adhesins that mediate the binding to host proteins, termed mscramms,
are ‘microbial surface components which recognise adhesive matrix molecules’. these mscramm components could mediate adhesion on prostheses by binding to host proteins that cover the implant surface in
286

vivo [5, 2, 19]. delmi and co-workers [5] investigated
the influence of fibronectin on in vitro and in vivo
s. aureus adhesion to stainless steel (steel), pure titanium (ti) and titanium alloy (ti-al-nb) alloy, metals used commonly for orthopaedic biomaterials. results from this study showed that all three metallic surfaces that were coated in vitro with fibronectin promoted greater adhesion of s. aureus than the untreated
metals. it has been found that fibronectin binds to s.
aureus via the amino-terminal domain of its structure [2] and that this interaction is biologically significant in the pathogenesis of s. aureus infections.
this suggests that the adhesion of such large numbers
of s. aureus to p may be due to its structure. fig. 1
shows that p, (3-amino-1-hydroxypropylidene)bisphosphonate contains an amino group, whereas c does
not. the cationic amino group on p may attract bacteria by either direct electrostatic interaction or through
a direct surface protein interaction. it is possible that
p provides an amino acid mimic on the surface of the
ha which interacts with the mscramm component.
it thus recognises the simulated host protein on the surface of the material, and mediates increased bacterial
adhesion to the hap surface. at present, there is no evidence for a difference in mscramm binding to the
two coated surfaces.
this forms part of an ongoing study of the potential use of bisphosphonates as coatings for orthopaedic
prostheses. it is the first indication that even though
hap may improve osseointegration [18], it may not
be a suitable coating for implants as it promotes adhesion of the bacteria s. aureus to the surface of the
material. a prosthesis coated with p would therefore
be prone to infection. the dependence of the effect of
p on bacterial adhesion on the coating concentration is
at present not known, and it may be possible to find a
coating concentration which improves osseointegration
but minimises bacterial adhesion. at present, c would
be a better coating for implants, as there were very few
bacterial colonies adhering to the surface, and, in fact,
c appears to slightly inhibit bacterial growth. however,
it should be noted that, with orthopaedic implants, the
complex in vivo response and the clinical risk of infection can not easily be predicted by a simple in vitro
adhesion test.

this study demonstrates the importance of determining the effect of modifying the biomaterials for medical
devices on their susceptibility to bacterial infection.
