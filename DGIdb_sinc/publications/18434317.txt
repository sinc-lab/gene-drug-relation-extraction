heparin (hep)2 is the most anionic proteoglycan, due to the
extensive sulfation of its glycosaminoglycan (gag) chains, and
contains many different sulfated disaccharide isomers of
n-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid or iduronic acid.
hep binds to many different soluble, matrix, and cell surface

proteins and receptors, and has many functions, including its
roles as an anti-coagulant and as a co-receptor for some growth
factors (1, 2). hep is a highly prescribed drug in surgical patients
and those at risk for thromobosis. the genes and metabolic
pathway for hep biosynthesis in mast cells are understood reasonably well, and many of the biological and clinical activities of
hep have been well studied for several decades (3– 6). in contrast, we know less about the catabolism of hep and how total
body homeostasis of this multifunctional proteoglycan is maintained. in particular, the mechanisms controlling systemic
turnover of hep, whether as endogenous proteoglycan or free
chain drugs, are not known.
although receptors for hep have been characterized on a
variety of cell types (e.g. macrophages, vascular smooth muscle
cells), none of these mediate substantial clearance of hep (7–9).
a few reports implicated a role for kupffer cells in hep clearance, but were not followed up (10, 11). the possible contribution of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells to hep uptake in these
primary cell preparations was not examined. because hep is a
widely prescribed drug, it is even more important to understand the factors that control its clearance and, therefore, pharmokinetics. animal studies of hep clearance, except by renal
function, have been difficult to perform, because hep binds to
so many soluble, cell surface or matrix proteins and become
widely distributed after injection.
unfractioned hep (3000 –30000 da), low molecular mass
hep (300 – 8000 da), and the pentasaccharide, fondaparinux,
are the three classes of hep drugs used to treat venous thrombosis, acute myocardial infarction, trauma, obesity, and coronary and peripheral vascular procedures; all situations wherein
patients need immediate platelet anti-coagulation therapy (12).
following an intravenous bolus, unfractioned hep has a halflife of ⬃1 h and is cleared from the circulation by the liver and
kidney (13). low molecular mass hep and the pentasaccharide,
subcutaneously injected, have half-lives of ⬃3– 6 and ⬃17 h,
respectively (14). larger more structurally diverse hep is more
readily cleared than the lower molecular weight fragments.
although clinical handbooks declare that hep is metabolized
and cleared by the reticuloendothelial system, the mechanisms
for hep clearance are not known.
the primary scavenger receptor for systemic turnover of ha
and most types of  xxxd1687xxx , but not hs, is hare/
stab-2, which mediates most of the total body ha turnover per
day (15–17). hare is found primarily in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen (18 –21), and

the  xxxg2211xxx  (hare; also
designated  xxxg2211xxx ) mediates systemic clearance of hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfates from the vascular and lymphatic
circulations. the internalized glycosaminoglycans are degraded
in lysosomes, thus completing their normal turnover process.
sinusoidal endothelial cells of human liver, lymph node, and
spleen express two hare isoforms of 315 and 190 kda. here we
report that the 190- and 315-kda hare isoforms, expressed
stably either in flp-in 293 cell lines or as soluble ectodomains,
specifically bind heparin (hep). the kd for hep binding to purified 190- and 315-kda hare ectodomains was 17.2 ⴞ 4.9 and
23.4 ⴞ 5.3 nm, respectively. cells expressing hare readily and
specifically internalized 125i-streptavidin-biotin-hep complexes, which was inhibited >70% by hyperosmolar conditions,
confirming that uptake is mediated by the clathrin-coated pit
pathway. internalization of hep occurred for many hours with
an estimated hare recycling time of ⬃12 min. internalized fluorescent streptavidin-biotin-hep was present in a typical endocytic vesicular pattern and was delivered to lysosomes. we conclude that hare in the sinusoidal endothelial cells of lymph
nodes and liver likely mediates the efficient systemic clearance
of hep and many different hep-binding protein complexes from
the lymphatic and vascular circulations.

experimental procedures
materials, solutions, and buffers—hep (free chains) was
from celsus (cincinnati, oh) and sigma. flp-in 293 cells, fetal
bovine serum, high glucose dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium (dmem), hygromycin b, zeocin, glutamine, plasmid
expression vectors, super-competent top10 escherichia coli,
lysotracker dnd-99, sa-alexa 488, and lipofectamine 2000
were from invitrogen. 125iodine (100 mci/ml; specific activity
of ⬎0.6 tbq/mg) in naoh and sepharose 6 fast flow (nickelnitrilotriacetic acid) resin were from ge healthcare. polysorp
strips were from nalgene nunc, int. (rochester, ny). epranex
plates were from plasso, llc (uk). streptavidin (sa) was from
pierce. 125i-sa was prepared as described previously (32, 33).
the protocol of yu and toole (34) was used to make biotin-hep
(b-hep), and the number of biotins/chain was quantified using
a quanttagtm biotin kit (vector labs, burlingame, ca). size
exclusion multiangle laser light scattering was performed to
measure hep molar mass and concentration, and to verify the
addition of 1–2 biotins per hep chain, without degradation
(23). western blot analysis was by colorimetric or enhanced
chemiluminescence detection of blotted protein. other materials, reagents, and kits were obtained as described recently
(23). tbs contains 20 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.0, 150 mm nacl;

constructs and cell lines expressing membrane-anchored or
soluble 190-hare, 190-hare(⌬link), or 315-hare—preparation of cdna constructs and vectors for the creation of stably
transfected 293 flp-in cell lines expressing, the full-length 315hare, 190-hare, or the secreted ectodomains of the 315hare or 190-hare (lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic
domains) were described by harris et al. (23, 24). creation of
190-hare(⌬link) cdna constructs and stable cell lines was
described recently (35). all recombinant hare proteins contain c-terminal v5 and his6 epitope tags. final clones were
selected based on criteria of normal growth and morphology,
good hare expression, and that a single cdna had inserted at
the recombinase-mediated integration site provided in the
flp-in cell lines. sds-page using 5% gels and western analysis
using anti-v5 ab were performed as described (24).
preparation of 125i-sa䡠b-hep complexes—for cell-based
assays, 2:1 molar ratios of b-hep and 125i-sa were mixed, at
40 –50-fold higher concentrations than in experiments, in 0.5
ml of endocytosis medium for 30 min on a rotary mixer at room
temperature just prior to an experiment. for controls with
125
i-sa alone, the same proportional amounts of free biotin and
125
i-sa were used. after mixing, the 125i-sa䡠b-hep or 125isa䡠biotin complexes were diluted into endocytosis medium.
final concentrations of b-hep and 125i-sa complexes in assays
were 100 and 96 nm (2.5 ␮g/ml), respectively.
binding and endocytosis of 125i-sa䡠b-hep—stably transfected cells, clone 9 (24), expressing 190-kda hare, were
plated in 12-well dishes and grown in dmem with 8% fetal calf
serum and 100 ␮g/ml hygromycin b for at least 2 days prior to
experiments. cells were washed with hanks’  xxxd2988xxx  and incubated at 37 °c for 60 min with endocytosis
medium (no serum) to allow hare-mediated internalization of
any bound serum gags. endocytosis assays with these washed
cells were performed at 37 °c in endocytosis medium containing pre-formed complexes of 125i-sa䡠b-hep with or without
unlabeled hep as competitor. binding of 125i-sa䡠b-hep to cells
was measured at 4 °c. specific binding or endocytosis was
assessed in the presence of excess unlabeled hep and, in most
cases, in cells incubated in parallel with only 125i-sa-biotin to
determine background counts/min values. these values were
subtracted from all data points to determine specific 125i-sa䡠bhep endocytosis. to determine the amount of 125i-sa䡠b-hep
binding by the total cell hare population, cells on ice were
permeabilized with 0.055% (w/v) digitonin, using a 25% stock
solution dissolved in anhydrous  xxxd1896xxx  (36). at the
indicated times, cells were washed three times with ice-cold
hanks’  xxxd2988xxx , lysed in 0.3 n naoh, and radiovolume 283 • number 25 • june 20, 2008

also in specialized tissues such as corneal and lens epithelium,
mesenchymal cells of heart valves, prismatic epithelial cells
covering the renal papillae (17), and in oviduct (22). partially
degraded ha perfuses from extracellular matrices in tissues
and enters the lymphatic and hepatic vascular circulation systems where it is endocytosed by hare and catabolized. the
partially degraded ha perfusing from tissues first encounters
hare in lymph nodes, which mediates ⬃85% of the daily ha
turnover. the remaining 15% of ha drains from the lymphatics
into the circulatory system and is removed by hare in liver
sinusoidal endothelium.
the large full-length human hare, encoded by the  xxxg2211xxx 
gene (accession number nm_017564 on chromosome 12q23.3
(ncbi data base), is a ⬃315-kda 2551-aa glycoprotein (21, 23).
the smaller 190-kda hare is not a splice variant, but rather it
is an isoform derived from the full-length 315-kda hare by
proteolysis (23). this 190-kda hare is, in fact, a functional
endocytic recycling receptor that mediates gag uptake in the
absence of the larger 315-kda hare (24). a primary function
of these two hare isoforms is to bind and internalize ha and
most of the  xxxd1687xxx  types (24 –28); advanced glycation end products are also ligands (29, 30). the internalized
hare-ligand complexes traffic through the early endocytic
pathway. after dissociation, the receptor recycles back to the
cell surface, whereas the gag ligand is delivered to lysosomes
for degradation (19, 24, 30, 31).
in this report, we identify hare as the receptor that specifically binds, internalizes, and mediates degradation of hep. we
demonstrate specific and high affinity hare-hep binding
under a variety of conditions and active hare-mediated endocytosis of hep in stable cell lines. we conclude that hep clearance by the body is mediated, probably predominantly, by
hare in the sinusoidal endothelium of the liver and lymph
nodes.

sa-ap, washed 6 times in tbst, and finally incubated with
 xxxd2821xxx  phosphate. the a405 values of the strips were
determined every 15 min for 1 h using a spectramax 340
(molecular devices) plate reader.
biotinylation and iodination of bsa—bsa (2 mg) was biotinylated using sulfo-nhs-lc-biotin (pierce) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and then dialyzed extensively
against pbs to eliminate excess free biotin. a 10:1 molar ratio of
biotin-to-bsa molecules was used and the final b-bsa product
contained an average of 5 biotins/bsa (a 50% efficient reaction), as assessed with the quanttag biotin kit (vector labs).
b-bsa (0.4 mg) was then iodinated as described previously
using 0.5 mci of 125i for 15 min at 22 °c (39). 125i-b-bsa was
separated from free iodine on a pd-10 column, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected and assessed for radioactivity using a
␥-counter. fractions in the first void volume peak were pooled,
and protein content and radioactivity were determined.
degradation assay—190-hare and ev cells were grown to
80 –90% confluence in 12-well plates prior to experiments. in
initial trials, ternary complexes of 125i-b-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep were
formed using numerous ratios of the three components, and
then tested for specific endocytosis by 190-hare cells. these
results indicated an optimal ratio of 100 nm 125i-b-bsa, 200 nm
sa, and 100 nm b-hep. the ternary complexes were allowed to
form while mixing by rotation at room temperature for 2 h just
prior to an experiment. similar mixtures containing 125i-b-bsa
and b-hep without the sa linker or the ternary complexes with
a 100-fold excess of unlabeled hep were used as controls for
nonspecific endocytosis. one hour prior to an experiment, cells
were incubated in dmem containing 2% bsa to block nonspecific binding sites and to allow endocytosis of any serum-derived gags bound to cell surface hare. cells were then incubated in dmem/bsa with 0.5 ml of the ternary complexes or
the control mixtures for 4 h, washed 3 times with 2 ml of cold
hanks’  xxxd2988xxx , and incubated for 15 h in 0.5 ml
of fresh dmem plus 2% serum. the collected chase medium
was cleared of cell debris by centrifugation and loaded on a
pd-10 (g-25 sephadex) column and eluted with pbs. fortyeight 0.5-ml fractions were collected and radioactivity in each
fraction was determined using a ␥-counter.

results
the possibility that hare is the major systemic clearance
receptor for hep in the vascular and lymphatic circulatory systems has great physiological significance and would be an
important finding. we, therefore, sought to test this using a
variety of protein- and cell-based assays.
the purified s315- and s190-hare ectodomains bind
b-hep—to determine whether hep can bind to both hare
isoforms, we used direct elisa-like binding assays with the
purified recombinant 190-hare and 315-hare ectodomains.
as the b-hep concentration increased, the amount of b-hep
bound to s190-hare increased sharply and saturated above
⬃100 nm (fig. 1a, solid line). these data were readily fit by
nonlinear regression analysis to a hyperbolic binding curve,
indicating a single class of hep binding sites with a kd of 17.4 ⫾
4.9 nm (p ⬍ 0.0001). binding of b-hep was specific, because the
presence of excess unlabeled hep eliminated by ⬎95% the

activity and protein content (37) were determined and
expressed as counts/min/␮g of protein.
ligand blot assay for b-hep binding—cells expressing 315or 190-hare were scraped from t-75 flasks in the presence of
serum and lysed in 0.5% nonidet p-40. after rotating for 1 h at
24 °c, cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cell
lysate was immunoprecipitated with anti-v5 ab, which recognizes this fusion epitope on both recombinant proteins. following 5% sds-page, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with tbst, 1% bsa at 4 °c for 2 h.
the method for detecting b-hep binding to hare is a modification of a ligand blot procedure for ha binding (38). nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with tbst/bsa for 2 h at
4 °c, washed, and incubated with 200 nm b-hep in tbst/bsa,
with or without 2000 nm unlabeled hep as competitor to assess
nonspecific binding. after incubation for 1.5 h at 4 °c, the
membrane was washed with excess tbst at least 5 times over
30 min, and incubated with 2.0 ␮g/ml 125i-sa for 30 min. after
washing with tbst at least 5 times over 30 min, the membrane
was dried at 22 °c and bound 125i-sa was detected by autoradiography using kodak ms film exposed at ⫺80 °c for 1–18 h.
western blot analysis—following the ligand blot procedure,
the membranes were rehydrated in tbst/bsa, incubated with
20 ng/ml anti-v5 ab (bethyl labs, montgomery, tx), washed,
incubated with the appropriate secondary ab conjugated with
horseradish peroxidase, and detected by ecl. the ecl signal
was captured using classic blue film bx (midsci, st. louis,
mo). densitometry on both the western and ligand blot films
was performed with an alpha innotech fluorchem 8000.
fluorescence microscopy—cells were grown on 18-mm glass
coverslips in complete medium for at least 2 days prior to the
experiment. b-hep (100 nm) or unlabeled hep was combined
with 1 ␮g/ml sa-alexa 488 in 0.5 ml of dmem and rotated for
30 min prior to the experiment. live cells were incubated with
sa-alexa 488䡠(biotin)-hep conjugates in endocytosis medium
for 6 h at 37 °c. the medium was replaced with fresh endocytosis medium containing 50 nm lysotracker and the cells were
incubated for 1 h. live cells on glass coverslips were washed by
dipping slides into pbs 3 times and immediately mounted onto
glass slides prior to visualization using a nikon diaphot 300
fluorescence microscope. images were captured with a
dxm1200 side-mounted camera operated by act-1 software
version 2.6.3.
share purification—s190-hare and s315-hare were
purified from pooled growth media by ni2⫹ chelate affinity
chromatography, followed by sds-page and electroelution as
described by harris et al. (24). final purified hare preparations were concentrated to 0.1–1.0 mg/ml using amicon concentrators (millipore), washed twice with pbs, and stored at
⫺20 °c until use in subsequent assays.
elisa-like—a set amount of hare protein in coating
buffer (200 ␮l) was placed in each well of a polysorp strip,
sealed to prevent evaporation, and incubated overnight at room
temperature. all subsequent steps were carried out at 37 °c.
the surfaces of the wells were then blocked by incubation
with tbst and 2% bsa for 1.5 h. after washing, increasing
concentrations of b-hep were added and the plates were incubated for 2 h, washed 6 times with tbst, incubated for 1 h with

figure 2. hep binds specifically to the 190-hare and 315-hare membrane proteins. 190- and 315-kda hare proteins from cell lysates were
immunoprecipitated with anti-v5 ab, separated on 5% sds-page, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose. for the ligand blot (lb), strips of nitrocellulose
were incubated with 200 nm b-hep with or without unlabeled excess (xs) hep,
and b-hep binding was detected with 125i-sa followed by autoradiography.
western blot (wb) analysis was then performed on the same blot using
anti-v5 ab to identify both isoforms of hare followed by ecl detection.

binding of sa-ap (not shown). a similar experiment with the
315-hare ectodomain also showed a hyperbolic binding curve
for b-hep (fig. 1a, dashed line) with a kd of 23.2 ⫾ 5.3 nm (p ⬍
0.0001), indicating virtually identical binding kinetics for the
s190- and s315-hare proteins. thus, the additional n-terminal portion of the s315-hare, consisting of 1135 aa, is not
involved in hep binding. the results confirm that hep specifically binds with high affinity to the purified s190-hare and
s315-hare ectodomains in vitro.

figure 1. hep binding to the purified ectodomains of 190-kda and 315kda hare is specific. a, equal molar amounts of purified s190- (e) and s315hare (f) proteins were coated onto polysorp strips. strips were blocked with
2% bsa to prevent nonspecific binding, washed, and incubated with 1.0 –
1024 nm b-hep for 1.5 h as indicated. bound b-hep was detected with sa-ap
and lines were calculated by regression analysis (sigmaplot version 10). the
kd for b-hep binding to s190-hare (solid line) was 17.4 ⫾ 4.9 nm (p ⬍
0.0001) and the kd for b-hep binding to s315-hare (dotted line) was 23.2 ⫾
5.3 nm (p ⬍ 0.0001). b, unlabeled hep was coated onto epranex plates
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (black bars). purified s190hare (4 ␮g/ml) was incubated in each well (except as indicated) for 2 h at
37 °c. bound s190-hare was detected with primary (1⬘ ab) anti-v5 ab (⫹)
or buffer only (⫺) and after washing, the wells were treated with buffer (⫺)
or secondary (2⬘ ab) anti-goat ab-ap conjugate (⫹) as indicated. values

a “reverse” elisa-like assay validates the specific harehep interaction—to ensure that the biotin tag was not producing false positive signals in our in vitro and endocytosis assays,
we assessed specific hep binding using a reverse elisa-like
assay. unlabeled hep was coated onto epranex plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions and then allowed to bind
with purified s190-hare protein. primary anti-v5 ab,
directed against the hare c-terminal epitope tag, followed by
a secondary ab-ap conjugate, was used to detect hare binding with hep (fig. 1b). because hep is highly anionic, and sticks
nonspecifically to many proteins, we included controls to
ensure that the primary (1⬘) or secondary (2⬘) abs were not
randomly adhering to hep or to the plastic. all controls showed
about the same low values (⬃10% of maximum), indicating that
the signal output from this assay is not due to nonspecific hep
binding. this assay also validates results from the ligand blot
and endocytosis assays that use pre-formed 125i-sa䡠b-hep
complexes.
the membrane-anchored 315- and 190-hare proteins bind
b-hep—the ability of the intact 190-hare and 315-hare isoforms to bind hep was assessed in membrane extracts after
nonreducing sds-page and transfer to nitrocellulose. the
hare proteins re-nature after electrotransfer and incubation
with tween 20, and can be detected by a ligand blot assay with
125
i-ha (38). nitrocellulose strips containing 190-hare or
315-hare were incubated with b-hep (fig. 2), with or without
an excess of unlabeled hep, to determine nonspecific binding,
and b-hep binding was assessed using 125i-sa and autoradiography. the results show that b-hep binds to both hare membrane proteins and binding is inhibited ⱖ95% by unlabeled
hep.
cells expressing 190-hare specifically endocytose hep—because it is difficult to radioiodinate hep without substantial
modification, we developed a protocol to measure binding or
internalization using 125i-sa complexed to b-hep. pre-formed
125
i-sa䡠b-hep complexes (using an optimum 2:1 molar ratio of
sa:b-hep) are readily taken up by cell lines expressing the 190hare alone (fig. 3a, circles). the rate of hep endocytosis was
linear for 8 h and then plateaued, indicating a steady-state accumulation of ligand. because hep naturally “sticks” to many substances, specific hare-mediated internalization of 125i-sa䡠b-

125

the cells (not shown). all three above controls to assess nonspecific endocytosis of 125i-sa-biotin were low (ⱕ5%) and virtually
identical for both cell lines.

or 125i-sa䡠b-hep at 37 °c for 4 h in parallel with the nonspecific 125i-sa-biotin
controls. cells were processed and values presented as above in a.

the hare link domain is required for ha, but not hep,
endocytosis—because we recently showed that the link
domain of hare is required for ha binding (35), we wanted to
determine whether it was also needed for hep endocytosis.
using pcr-based techniques, we made a 190-hare mutant
lacking the 93-amino acid link domain and created stable 190hare(⌬link) cell lines. to compare the hep uptake abilities of
190-hare(⌬link) and wild type 190-hare, we incubated
both types of cells with either 125i-sa䡠b-ha or 125i-sa䡠b-hep
(fig. 3b). nonspecific endocytosis of 125i-sa-biotin was subtracted to assess specific internalization of ha or hep by both
cell lines. cells expressing the 190-hare (fig. 3b, black bars)
internalized both b-ha and b-hep complexes, as expected. in
contrast, cells expressing 190-hare(⌬link) (fig. 3b, gray bars)
internalized a similar amount of b-hep, but very little b-ha. these
results confirm, for the first time, that the hare link domain is
necessary for ha, but not hep, binding and internalization.
190-kda hare is a recycling endocytic receptor for hep
internalization—ha uptake involves binding to hare, internalization, and then dissociation in maturing acidic endosomes. the “free” receptor is recycled back to the cell surface
and undergoes multiple rounds of ha internalization. we used
190-hare and ev cells to compare cell surface binding versus
cellular accumulation of hep to determine whether hare also
is able to release hep and recycle back to the cell surface to bind
and internalize more hep in a continuous manner (fig. 4a). at
4 °c hep binds to 190-hare on the cell surface, which comprises ⬃10% of the total cellular receptor number (23, 24). to
assess receptor recycling, we compared values for surface binding to hep (i.e. number of surface hep receptors) with total
cellular accumulation of hep by endocytosis at 37 °c over 3 h.
after subtracting the nonspecific values for both cell lines, 190hare cells internalized ⬃15 times the amount of total hep
compared with the surface-bound hep. we estimate that the
receptor recycling time is ⬃12 min: to bind, internalize, and
release hep, and then return to the cell surface for another
endocytic cycle.
hep endocytosis is mediated by the clathrin-coated pit
pathway—the clathrin-coated pit pathway is one of the most
efficient and rapid methods employed by cells to internalize
ligands. endocytosis via the clathrin-coated pathway can be
temporarily and reversibly inhibited by hyperosmolar conditions, e.g. ⱖ400 mm sucrose as an osmolite (40 – 42). because,
our previous data show that hare utilizes this pathway for
internalization of ha (23, 24, 31), our goal was to determine
whether hare retains this property when bound with hep.
cells expressing 190-hare were incubated with 125i-sa䡠bhep in dmem, with increasing concentrations of sucrose, or
with non-labeled hep as competitor for 4 h (fig. 4b). under
hyperosmotic conditions (e.g. ⱖ0.4 m sucrose), specific receptor-mediated endocytosis of 125i-sa䡠b-hep decreased by
⬎70%, indicating that hep uptake depends on clathrin assembly into coated pits. cells incubated with 125i-sa䡠b-hep and
excess unlabeled hep represented the nonspecific baseline
(⬃10%) for hep binding and internalization. in conclusion,
these data demonstrate that the internalization of hep is
dependent on the receptor (hare)-mediated clathrin-coated
pit pathway.

human hare is a clearance receptor for heparin

internalized hep is delivered to lysosomes—previous studies
with both the rat and human hare isoforms showed that
hare binds, internalizes, and delivers ha to lysosomes (19, 24,
31). to confirm that hep is also internalized and delivered to
lysosomes, we incubated 190-hare cells with sa-alexa 488
bound to b-hep or free in the presence of unlabeled hep, as a
negative control (fig. 5). after 6 h, the medium was replaced
with medium containing 50 nm lysotracker (invitrogen), a
non-toxic, membrane-permeable, weakly basic dye, which is
fluorescent when protonated in acidic compartments (e.g. lysosomes). lower magnification shows a fairly homogenous population of cells expressing hare (fig. 5). it is evident that 190hare cells have numerous lysosomes, as indicated by
lysotracker (fig. 5, a, c, and e). sa-alexa 488-b-hep was also
present in many internal vesicles, some of which also stained
with the lysotracker dye (fig. 5, d and f). this is expected,
because many compartments along the intracellular endocytic

17346 journal of biological chemistry

pathway become saturated relatively quickly with the internalized hep and then wait to be delivered to lysosomes, where the
slower degradation processes occur. to ensure that fluorescence was not due to nonspecific internalization of sa-alexa
488, cells were incubated with the same amount of sa-alexa
488 and unlabeled hep. by uncoupling the hep from the fluorescent tag, the cells could be assessed for nonspecific endocytosis of sa-alexa 488. most cells internalized a tiny amount of
sa-alexa 488, as expected, but overall cell fluorescence
decreased ⬎95% and was difficult to capture, even at a higher
camera sensitivity (fig. 5b). thus, the vast majority of the saalexa 488䡠b-hep conjugate is internalized specifically via
hare (fig. 5, d and f).
degradation of internalized b-hep is difficult to demonstrate
directly, because all cells have other biotin-containing molecules. therefore, we verified that b-hep is degraded after endocytosis by an indirect approach using ternary complexes of 125ib-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep (fig. 6). 125i-sa䡠b-hep could not be used,
because sa is extremely resistant to proteases after uptake by

human hare is a clearance receptor for heparin

discussion
hare (also designated  xxxg2211xxx  and  xxxg2211xxx ) is the primary
receptor for the clearance of many gags from the circulatory
and lymphatic systems. hare is a recycling receptor that operates via the coated pit endocytosis pathway to mediate internalization, and the subsequent delivery of ligand to lysosomes for
degradation (19, 23, 24, 31, 43). full-length 315-kda hare is a
type i membrane protein (2551 aa) with a small cytoplasmic
domain (72 aa), one membrane domain, and a large extracellular domain (2458 aa). the 190-kda hare is identical to the
c-terminal 1417 aa of the 315-hare, and is generated in vivo

cells were incubated with 125i-b-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep complexes without (a) or with
(b) a 100-fold excess of unlabeled hep, or with 125i-b-bsa and b-hep in the
absence of sa (c), ev cells (d) were incubated with 125i-b-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep complexes. cells were incubated at 37 °c for 4 h, washed, and then incubated for
15 h with fresh medium. medium samples were chromatographed over
pd-10 columns and 0.5-ml fractions were assessed for radioactivity. the first
peak (v0; fraction 10) represents a small amount of intact 125i-b-bsa, coupled
or uncoupled to sa䡠b-hep. the large broad peak (fractions 20 – 45) represents
degraded 125i-b-bsa fragments that were released into the medium, after
lysosomal digestion, during the chase period. data points are the average of
three separate samples.

cells or in vitro (e.g. treatment of 125i-sa with pronase, trypsin
or proteinase k for 2 h at 37 °c did not alter band intensity or
position; by sds-page, silver staining, and autoradiography).
in contrast, bsa was 100% degraded under the same conditions
(not shown).
to assess degradation, we used ternary complexes of 125i-bbsa䡠sa䡠b-hep in an indirect approach in which biotin-bsa is
degraded only following hep-mediated endocytosis (fig. 6).
complexes of 125i-b-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep were formed under conditions that optimized specific hep-dependent endocytosis by
190-hare cells. 190-hare or ev cells were incubated with
these ternary (or other control) complexes for 4 h to load up
intracellular endocytic vesicles and then chased for 15 h with
fresh medium to allow time for delivery to lysosomes, degradation, and release of degradation products. gel filtration of 125ib-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep chase medium samples showed most of the
125
i-labeled radioactivity in the included second peak, indicating that lysosomal enzymes had digested 125i-bsa to a variety
of smaller sizes (fig. 6a). a small amount of radioactivity was
present in the void volume; probably partially digested or undigested complexes. 125i-b-bsa degradation products were virtually absent in the ev cell control, indicating that cells not
expressing hare do not internalize hep, and thus do not
degrade 125i-b-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep complexes (fig. 6d). to ensure
that the 125i-b-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep degradation peak was the result
of hep-mediated endocytosis, 190-hare cells were incubated
with these complexes in the presence of a 100-fold excess of
hep (fig. 6b). the amount of degraded products decreased by
96% (after subtracting the small ev cell background), confirming that hare is required for the observed degradation. as a
second control, 190-hare cells were incubated with “uncoupled” complexes (i.e. 125i-b-bsa and b-hep) to which sa was
not added to connect b-hep with 125i-b-bsa (fig. 6c). again,
degradation of 125i-b-bsa was decreased 81%, consistent with
the conclusion that 125i-b-bsa䡠sa䡠b-hep internalization
requires hare-mediated binding to hep.

human hare is a clearance receptor for heparin

e. n. harris and p. h. weigel, unpublished results.

on these scavenger receptors, hep binding has been assessed
only as a competitor for binding of ldl, acetylated ldl, or
oxidized ldl; labeled hep was not used in direct binding studies. negative results in indirect binding studies do not exclude
the possibility that hep binds to other independent sites on
marco, srec, and cl-pi. this is the first report to show
directly that hep binds with high affinity to both purified
recombinant hare in vitro and to live cells expressing hare.
thus far, direct binding studies have shown that hare binds
with ha (18), advanced glycation end products (29), several
chondroitin sulfates (23), and hep (this study). in addition,
hare is expressed in prime locations (e.g. the endothelium of
liver and lymph nodes) to be a front-line receptor able to internalize multiple ligands. hep binding to vascular endothelium
after intravenous injection into animals was first reported by
mahadoo et al. (60). follow-up studies showed hep binding
and endocytosis by cultured vascular endothelial cells, but no
receptor was ever identified (61, 62). moreover, these studies
were from the perspective of how hep binding to vascular
endothelium affected soluble protein mediators in the coagulation cascade, and they concluded that the vascular endothelium
is involved with partial neutralization of the anticoagulant
activity of hep. both groups concluded that hep binding sites
on the vascular endothelium were nonspecific.
in contrast, the present study shows that both isoforms of
hare specifically bind hep with high affinity and mediate its
rapid internalization. because hare is a continuously recycling receptor, it clears hep very efficiently. the estimated
recycling time for hare-mediated uptake of hep is very similar to the values for hare-mediated uptake of ha (31) and
those for the asialoglycoprotein (43), mannose (63), transferrin
(64), and ldl (65) receptors.
because ha and hep are both natural ligands for hare, an
important question is do they compete with each other for
binding. data from ongoing studies,3 show that ha and hep do
not compete with each other, consistent with reports using
labeled hep and ha in animals (66, 67). unlabeled ha or  xxxd1687xxx  did not affect clearance of labeled hep, indicating the binding sites for hep were not the same as for ha. liver
sinusoidal endothelial cells have two active but different binding activities for ha and hep, and the natural assumption was
that two different receptors must be involved. in the present
report we show that, in fact, the human receptors for both hep
and ha are the same protein: hare. importantly, both activities are in the 190-hare and 315-hare isoforms. furthermore, we find that the link domain of hare is crucial for ha
internalization, but is not required for hep internalization (fig.
3b). we also find that ha and hep can bind to hare simultaneously; these results will be presented elsewhere in a more
extensive analysis of the ha and hep binding sites of hare,
and their relationships with other ligands.3
our published and unpublished results3 show that hs, in
contrast to the more highly sulfated hep, does not bind to
hare (23, 24). this is significant, because hspgs are found
throughout the developing hematopoietic system (68), and if
hare bound hspgs, it might interfere with development of
these cells in spleen and, possibly, bone marrow. exclusive
binding of hep, but not hspg, by hare could be advantageous

and in vitro in stably transfected cells by proteolytic cleavage
(19, 24). we and others report that recombinant hare behaves
similarly in in vitro cell culture and in the sinusoidal endothelium of liver, lymph node, and spleen (28, 30, 44, 72). we show
in this report that purified s190-hare ectodomain specifically
binds hep (figs. 1 and 2), that cells expressing the recombinant
protein internalize labeled hep (figs. 3 and 4), and that hep is
trafficked to lysosomes (figs. 5 and 6).
this is the first report that hare is also involved in the
systemic clearance and homeostasis of hep. for several
decades, the anticoagulant properties of hep have been used to
treat thrombosis. however, newly recognized hep properties
may be useful as inhibitors of cancer metastasis and hiv-1 replication (45, 46). as with any soluble circulating factor designed
to stimulate cellular responses, there must be efficient (and
often redundant) mechanisms to dampen the signal and restore
normal homeostasis. despite thousands of basic and clinical
studies on the biology of hep, few reports have implicated specific receptors or cell types that are involved in the important
process of removing hep quickly and efficiently after its biological actions have been initiated.
in contrast to ha, little is known about the systemic turnover
of hep, although a current model is that extracellular heparanases and proteases partially degrade hep and hspgs, and the
released gag fragments could then be internalized and completely degraded at the local tissue level (47). extracellular
matrix and intracellular heparanases are important for hspg
turnover, hep catabolism, and extracellular matrix remodeling
(47–51). during extracellular matrix remodeling, a majority of
the resulting free gags and proteoglycan fragments enter the
lymphatic and circulatory systems, especially during injury or
disease. without an efficient gag-clearing mechanism, these
fluid circulatory systems would be overwhelmed with large
amounts of debris derived from tissue extracellular matrixes
throughout the body. we propose that the scavenger receptor
hare in sinusoidal endothelial cells of liver and lymph node,
and perhaps spleen, recognizes and internalizes hep for eventual degradation in lysosomes.
the liver is a primary organ for hep homeostasis involving
hep-binding activities in the sinusoidal or non-continuous
endothelium (52), kupffer cells (10), and parenchymal cells
(53). all these cell types contain scavenger receptors such as
 xxxg2013xxx  on parenchymal cells (54, 55) and macrosialin (56) and
lox-1 (57) on kupffer cells. hare is found in sinusoidal endothelial cells, not in kupffer or parenchymal cells. hare is also
one of the few scavenger receptors identified to be associated
with clathrin-coated pits (19, 30, 31), which contributes to
much higher endocytosis and recycling rates (e.g. fig. 4b). in the
past 20 years, many scavenger receptors have been cloned and,
by definition, their common ligands are ldl or its derivatives,
acetylated ldl and oxidized ldl (58). scavenger receptors
often bind more than one ligand and some (e.g. macrosialin and
lox-1) bind hep, whereas marco, srec, and cl-pi do not
(58). hare, like other scavenger receptors, binds acetylated
ldl3 (29, 59). despite much accumulated ligand binding data

in that by-products of coagulation and infection are readily
cleared from the circulation, keeping the systemic fluids relatively clear of these undesired products in contrast to their
higher concentrations in wound or infected areas. for instance,
 xxxg2266xxx  counteracts  xxxg748xxx  and
inhibits factors viia and x (69). under normal conditions,  xxxg741xxx , a proteolytic product of  xxxg741xxx , in the presence of
factors vii and viiia, will bind  xxxg2266xxx 
on endothelial cells and be internalized via an unknown receptor (70). in the presence of hep, however,  xxxg748xxx  pathway
inhibitor binds hep and is released from the endothelium to
form complexes that can include factors viia and x (71). these
complexes may then bind via the hep, and be internalized and
cleared from blood by cells expressing hare.
based on the discovery that hare mediates the rapid
internalization of hep, an intriguing possibility is that hep
may be the “vehicle” for the turnover of dozens of different
hep-binding proteins (e.g. growth factors) found in blood,
lymph, and interstitial fluids. hep-protein complexes in the
vascular and lymphatic circulation systems could be cleared
by hare and degraded. such a general clearance mechanism
might be more physiologically practical than the utilization of
dozens of different parallel receptor systems in which individual proteins in protein-hep complexes were recognized and
cleared from blood.
