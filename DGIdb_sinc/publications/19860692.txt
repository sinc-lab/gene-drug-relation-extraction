introduction
as cyclic nucleotides camp and cgmp are all-important
second messengers in the biology of the cell, it is perhaps no
wonder that organisms have evolved a large number of
phosphodiesterase (pde) enzymes to control their degradation. in mammals, 21 different pde-encoding genes have
been identified so far, classified in 11 families by virtue of
their sequence characteristics and the enzymatic properties of
their corresponding protein products. pde variability is
further enhanced by alternative rna splicing and/ or
transcription initiation which in humans produce more than
60 different mrnas [1, 2]. structural and expressional
variability translates into differential compartmentation,
regulation and functional diversification. indeed, pdes are
known to participate in a multitude of physiological
processes including smooth muscle proliferation, regulation
of ion currents, hormone secretion, platelet aggregation,
cardiac contractility, vision, inflammatory and immunological signaling and penile erection, to name but a few.
pathological conditions can affect individual pde gene
expression and/ or enzymic activity [3], suggesting that
pdes can be good pharmacological targets. specific
inhibitors for pde2,  xxxg1695xxx , pde4, and pde9 are currently
used in clinical practice or being tested in clinical trials for
the treatment of a variety of conditions including heart
failure, renal disease, inflammation, memory loss and
alzheimer’s disease [3, 4]. nowhere was the idea of pde
inhibition more fruitful however, as in the case of pde5
inhibitors, to which this review is dedicated.
 xxxg1701xxx 
 xxxg1701xxx  (pde5) was first characterized as a
cgmp-binding, cgmp- hydrolyzing activity in platelets [5]
but later found to be prominently expressed in smooth
muscle. pde5-rich tissues include the brain, kidney,

pancreas, penis and lung [6, 7]. to date, a single pde5 gene
( xxxg1701xxx ) has been discovered, located in the long arm of
chromosome 4 in humans [1]. the gene gives rise to 3
different mrnas and corresponding proteins (pde5a1, 2
and 3) which differ at their amino-terminal ends [8]. all
three isoforms display considerable specificity for cgmp
(km = 3-6 mu compared to 290 mum for camp) – however
when camp is bound, it is hydrolyzed with similar
efficiency [9]. binding of cgmp at the catalytic domain is
allosterically regulated (stimulated) by cgmp binding at two
regulatory domains termed gaf-a and gaf-b, both located
n-terminal to the catalytic domain, a characteristic shared by
some (pde2, 5, 6, 10, 11) of the other pde types as well [1].
phosphorylation of a neighbouring serine residue by protein
kinase-g (pkg) or protein kinase-a (pka) further enhances
cgmp binding at the gaf-a site and provides for further
control of pde5 activity [10]. the expression of all 3
mrnas is induced by both cgmp and camp in human cells
[8]. by affecting cgmp levels and, thereby, pkg activity,
pde5 acts to regulate vascular smooth muscle contraction
and relaxation most notably in the penis [11] and the lung
[12]. pde5 may also function as a regulator of cardiac
myocyte contractility acting either directly, by affecting ca2+
sensitivity or indirectly, by affecting the activity of  xxxg1695xxx ,
a camp-specific phosphodiesterase inhibited by cgmp [13].
pde5 inhibitors
three pde5 inhibitors – sildenafil (viagra), vardenafil
(levitra) and tadalafil (cialis) - are currently approved by
the fda and the emea for use in erectile dysfunction (ed),
whereas sildenafil is also marketed under a different
proprietary name (revatio) for the treatment of pulmonary
arterial hypertension (pah). a forth pde5 inhibitor,
 xxxd3464xxx  ( xxxd3464xxx ), is currently marketed in south korea,
has been approved for distribution in the russian federation
and is undergoing phase iii clinical trials in the usa, while
others ( xxxd250xxx , slx-2101, mirodenafil) are in the pipeline
[14]. sildenafil, vardenafil and  xxxd3464xxx  all belong to a
category of compounds known as pyrazolopyrimidines and
display structural similarity to cgmp, while tadalafil has a
completely different structure (fig. 1). a number of review

articles comparing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil have been
published recently [15-17]. information on the pharmacological properties of  xxxd3464xxx  is still limited [18-20]. all
four drugs are rapidly absorbed following oral administration. sildenafil, vardenafil and  xxxd3464xxx  reach maximum
plasma concentration (cmax) in-between 0.5 and 2 h (average
tmax  1 h), producing similar times of onset (penile erection
within 1 h), under fasting conditions. tadalafil displays a
longer tmax ( 2 h); onset time is similar to the other three
drugs however. a high fat meal increases tmax (by  1 h) and
decreases cmax (by 20-30%) for sildenafil and vardenafil but
has no effect on the absorption of tadalafil. vardenafil shows
the lowest absolute oral bioavailability (15%) due to
extensive intestinal and hepatic first-pass metabolism.
sildenafil has a higher absolute bioavailability (38-41%). no
actual absolute bioavailability data exist in humans for
 xxxd3464xxx  and tadalafil. however, tadalafil could have similar
bioavailability to sildenafil or higher, based on oral
absorption data [17] and  xxxd3464xxx ’s oral bioavailability in rats
has been calculated to be 38-56%, slightly higher than the
corresponding value for sildenafil (23-44%) [20]. sildenafil,
vardenafil and tadalafil all display volumes of distribution
higher than 42 l (average total water compartment)
suggesting good tissue exposure and possible extravascular
binding.  xxxd3464xxx  was also predicted to have a similarly high
volume of distribution, based on a model of interspecies

scaling [21]. when in the circulation, there is a high degree
( 95%) of plasma protein binding. cyp3a4 is the main
metabolizing enzyme of all four drugs, providing the basis
for drug interactions of pde5 inhibitors with  xxxg590xxx 
inducers (rifampin, phenytoin,  xxxd432xxx ) leading to
decreased systemic exposure, and  xxxg590xxx  inhibitors
(erythromycin, ritonavir,  xxxd2422xxx , cimetidine, grapefruit
juice) resulting in increased systemic exposure. in addition,
 xxxg592xxx  reportedly contributes to the biotransformation of
sildenafil,  xxxd3464xxx  and vardenafil [22] and cyp2c9 to that
of sildenafil and vardenafil (further intensifying the effect of
ritonavir which is also a cyp2c inhibitor); cyp2d6 has a
limited effect on sildenafil [17]. active metabolites have
been reported for sildenafil and vardenafil [17]. elimination
is mainly hepatic and into the feces. only tadalafile is
excreted to a significant extent (36%) into the urine, a
property reflected in the more than doubling of its auc in
subjects with renal impairment [23]. also, impaired
elimination of  xxxd3464xxx  was associated with slower renal
clearance in rats [24]. considerable differences exist with
respect to oral (and systemic) clearance and elimination halflife (t1/2) between the four pde5 inhibitors: sildenafil and
vardenafil have t1/2 values which do not exceed 5h, whereas
tadalafil has an average t1/2 of 17.5 h. reported t1/2 values for
 xxxd3464xxx  vary from 7.3 to 12.1, depending on the dose [20].
there are also small but well established differences in
potency and selectivity. ic50 values for pde5 activity vary

3466 current pharmaceutical design, 2009, vol. 15, no. 30

according to assay conditions but vardenafil displays
consistently a  10-fold higher potency than sildenafil or
tadalafil whereas the latter appear to be slightly more potent
than  xxxd3464xxx  [18, 25]. pde6 inhibition is much more
pronounced with sildenafil, vardenafil and  xxxd3464xxx 
(selectivity ratio of 7.4, 15 and 9, respectively) than it is with
tadalafil (selectivity ratio of 780). therefore, while sildenafil
and  xxxd3464xxx  are expected to produce transient visual
disturbances at the highest dose, tadalafil is not (on account
of its higher potency, vardenafil is used at lower doses than
sildenafil and so pde6 inhibition does not constitute a
common clinical problem). low pde1 selectivity, associated
with vasodilation, flushing, and tachycardia, is – again –
more a concern for sildenafil or  xxxd3464xxx  (selectivity ratio 41
and 149, respectively) than for tadalafil (selectivity ratio >
1000) users. tadalafil displays low selectivity towards
pde11 inhibition (selectivity ratio of 7.1) but the clinical
consequences of this – if any - are not clear yet. functional
interaction of pde5 inhibitors with hypotensive agents
(potentiation) is particularly strong in the case of nitrates; coadministration is thus contraindicated but care should also be
taken with calcium blockers (amlodipine, nifedipine), blockers (doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin) and angiotensin
 xxxg100xxx  antagonists [26].
pde5 inhibitors
system

and

the

urogenital

over the last 10 years which followed its fda approval,
pde5 inhibitors have been clearly established as first-line
therapy for the treatment of ed. under normal conditions,
sexual stimulation causes the local release of no from nerve
endings and endothelial cells in the penile tissue, leading to
activation of soluble guanyl cyclase (sgc) and the
subsequent generation of cgmp in the smooth muscle cells
lining the arterioles and sinusoids of the penis.  xxxd1274xxx 
then acts to activate a number of protein kinases – most
notably pkg – eventually leading to smooth muscle relaxation, adequate blood flow into the sinusoidal spaces,
compression of penile venules between the distended
sinusoids, and penile erection [27, 28]. as previously
mentioned, pde5 acts to regulate smooth muscle relaxation
by limiting cgmp availability. pharmacological inhibition of
pde5 causes a marked elevation of cgmp concentrations in
the glans penis, corpus cavernosum and corpus spongiosum,
thus enhancing the effect of sexual stimulation in these
tissues; pde5 inhibitors have no effect on the penis in the
absence of sexual stimulation, when the concentrations of
no and cgmp are low [29, 30]. the success of pde5
inhibitors in treating erectile dysfunction has sparked
considerable interest in whether these drugs can be used for
treating other disorders of the urogenital system as well.
female sexual and reproductive function
pde5 has been identified in cytosolic extracts of human
clitoral corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells [31], and in
human anterosuperior vaginal tissue, mostly in vascular
smooth muscle cells but also in periurethral glands and the
vaginal epithelium [32]. sildenafil and zaprinast have been
found to competitively inhibit pde activity in vitro,

kouvelas et al.

subsequently increasing cgmp levels in human cultured
vaginal smooth muscle cells, suggesting involvement of the
no/cgmp transduction system in female sexual response,
with sildenafil being approximately 50-fold more potent than
zaprinast [33]. pde5 inhibitors, were also found to increase
vaginal blood flow in anesthetized rats [34]. clark et al
studied the effect of zaprinast, on paced mating behaviour in
conscious female rats in order to assess female sexual
function after pde5 inhibitor administration [35]. zaprinast
lengthened contact-return latencies following the reception
of an ejaculation and treated rats displayed high levels of
sexual receptivity and a preference for a sexually active male
[36]. another study showed that alterations in the pelvic
adjustments made by female hamsters following the
administration of a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor were
ameliorated by zaprinast, suggesting a further connection
between the serotonin and no–cgmp pathways in the
regulation of female sexual behaviours [37]. despite
promising preclinical results however, pde5 inhibitors have
demonstrated modest overall clinical effectiveness in treating
female sexual dysfunction; administration of sildenafil in
menopausal, postmenopausal, or post-hysterectomy women
with self-described sexual dysfunction or a primary
complaint of female sexual arousal disorder was associated
with some degree of improvement from baseline, but this
had little or no effect on subjective arousal and ultimately in
having a markedly better sexual life [38-41].
human or animal ovaries do not express pde5 but the
enzyme has been isolated and characterized from the
cytosolic fraction of human term myometrium [42], and also
identified in cultured human uterine smooth muscle cells
[43]. sildenafil administration in uterine strips from nonpregnant rats, inhibited contractile force induced by various
contraction-inducing agents [44].
urinary function
 xxxg1701xxx  has been identified in human
ureteral smooth muscle cells and its effect was studied in
vitro[45]. gratzke et al have recently demonstrated that
cgmp is involved in the control of the normal function of
the smooth musculature of the human ureter and pdeinhibitors can indeed cause in vitro ureteral smooth muscle
relaxation, with vardenafil being the most and tadalafil the
least potent agent in regard to relaxation [46]. similarly,
zaprinast has been shown to induce ureteral smooth muscle
relaxation in vitro [47]. no relevant clinical data exist to date
regarding the possible role of pde5 inhibitors in the
treatment of ureteral colic however.
lower urinary tract symptoms
messenger rnas for a large number of pde subtypes
have been detected in various histological regions of prostate
tissue, and more recently, the presence of pde4, 5 and 11
has been conformed immunohistochemically in the transition
zone of the human prostate, suggesting that pde inhibition
may have a role in the pharmacotherapy of lower urinary
tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph) [48,
49].

pde5 inhibitors

current pharmaceutical design, 2009, vol. 15, no. 30

peyronie’s disease
sildenafil and  xxxd2880xxx  have demonstrated dosedependent antifibrotic activity in fibroblast cultures from
peyronie’s disease (pd) plaque [50, 51]. in a rat model of
pd involving the effect of long-term vardenafil treatment on
development of fibrotic plaques, vardenafil administration
slowed and reversed the early stages of an experimental pdlike plaque and might have prevented the development of
more advanced plaques [52]. however, no clinical data exist,
todate, involving the use of pde5 inhibitors in pd.
furthermore, all formulations of pde5 inhibitors carry
labeled precautions regarding their use in patients with an
anatomical deformation of the penis, such as angulation,
cavernosal fibrosis, or pd .
premature ejaculation
premature ejaculation (pe), with an estimated incidence
of 30%, is the most common type of male sexual dysfunction. pde5 inhibitors have been used alone or in combination with ssri antidepressants for treating pe. results for
the treatment of men with pe with no concomitant ed have
been inconsistent. this is probably explained by the lack of
any sound pharmacological grounds supporting the effect of
a pde5 inhibitor on the central and/or peripheral control of
ejaculation [53-57]. furthermore, a systematic review on
pde5 inhibitor use for treating pe concluded that there is
limited evidence to support a role for pde5 inhibitors in the
treatment of pe, although some evidence suggests that they
might be of benefit for men with both pe and ed [58].
pde5 inhibitors
system

and

the

respiratory

pulmonary arterial hypertension
as early as 1991 it was observed that zaprinast, a
relatively specific pde5 inhibitor, was able to attenuate
hypoxia - induced vasoconstriction in isolated rat lungs [59].
it was later shown that pde5 is predominantly expressed in
murine lungs [7, 60] and that it is upregulated under
conditions of increased pulmonary blood flow in lambs [61].
parallel developments in  xxxd2738xxx  (no) research
established the significance of locally produced no for
ventilation/perfusion matching in the lung (the adaptive
response which allows blood from the pulmonary artery to
drain selectively well ventilated areas of the lung), especially
under high pressure conditions, and provided the rational for
the use of administered no and/or of enhancing its action in
treating pah [12, 62, 63]. proof-of-principle for the use of
pde5 inhibitors in pah was obtained when it was shown
that sildenafil can prevent the experimentally induced
(hypoxic) increase in pulmonary artery pressure in healthy
volunteers and in mice, where it also reduced right
ventricular systolic pressure and hypertrophy and inhibited
pulmonary vascular remodeling [64]. additional evidence as
to the clinical efficacy of sildenafil – defined mainly as
improvement in exercise capacity and haemodynamics - was
produced by a number of open-labeled studies [reviewed in
2], and, following the successful conclusion of a doubleblind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial with 278
idiopathic or associated pah patients (the sildenafil use in

3467

pulmonary hypertension/ super-1) [65], sildenafil
received indication for pah, in a 20 mg, 3 times daily dose,
by both the fda and the emea.
a small number of studies have examined the therapeutic
potential of the other pde5 inhibitors in pah. both vardenafil and tadalafil have been reported to reduce pulmonary
arterial pressure and to improve functional capacity to a
degree similar to sildenafil [66, 67]. differential effects have
also been recorded however; in an in vitro comparison of the
effect of the three drugs on rabbit isolated pulmonary artery
ring preparations, vardenafil blocked ca 2+ fluxes, whereas
sildenafil and tadalafil did not [68]. this additional effect
may underlie the faster onset of action of vardenafil compared to sildenafil or tadalafil - in decreasing pulmonary
arterial pressure, as well as its reduced selectivity for
pulmonary circulation [69]. on the other hand, in another in
vitro experiment performed with isolated rat pulmonary
arteries, all three drugs induced dose-dependent relaxation of
the pulmonary artery and inhibited phenylephrine-induced
vasoconstriction but only taldalafil inhibited vasoconstriction
due to hypoxia and attenuated hypoxia-induced pulmonary
artery up-regulation of tnf and il-1 gene expression [70].
so far, there is no published record of clinical studies with
respect to the effect of udalafil on pah, but this drug was
shown to attenuate compensatory right ventricular hypertrophy and monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension
in rats [71, 72].
obstructive pulmonary diseases
the role of pde5 inhibitors on treatment of respiratory
diseases as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease was initially suggested by giembycz [73] who
proposed their combined use with pde4 inhibitors. wang
and colleagues administered sildenafil in acrolein-induced
airway inflammation in rats and found that pre-treatment
with the pde5 inhibitor attenuated the inflammation,
reduced mucus production, reversed the reduction of cgmp
and suppressed the increase in no metabolites and
inflammatory cytokines induced by acrolein [74]. however,
when sildenafil was tested in combination with l-arginine
(the substrate of no synthases) in an in vivo model of
ovalbumin-sensitized bp2 mice, was found to significantly
enhance the airway response to metacholine, worsened the
histological damage and increased the relative amount of
eosinophils in mice [75].
phosphodiesterase inhibition was also tested concerning
their use in lung fibrosis, in primary human lung fibroblasts,
before and after tgf--induced differentiation to myofibroblasts. while sildenafil administered alone had no effect,
when combined with the sgc activator bay58-2667 it
reduced the differentiation caused by tgf- significantly
[76].
the potential therapeutic use of pde5 inhibition in cystic
fibrosis is also under investigation. endosomal hyperacidification of endothelial cells in cystic fibrosis is found to have
its cause in the loss of sodium transport control. hyperacidification in cystic fibrosis cells was corrected after
treatment with sildenafil in vitro, through normalizing the
endosomal ph [77]. in addition, sildenafil was reportedly
able to activate trafficking of mutant cystic fibrosis

3468 current pharmaceutical design, 2009, vol. 15, no. 30

transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) and to induce
chloride transport activity in cells obtained from cystic
fibrotic patients [78]. similar results were obtained with both
sildenafil and vardenafil in a mouse cystic fibrosis model
harbouring the f508-cftr mutation, suggesting that both
pde5 inhibitors are worth testing in a clinical setting [79].

kouvelas et al.

pde5 inhibitors and the heart

– induced phosphorylation of the above kinases, despite a
more than doubling of pkg activity [80]. it is interesting to
note that the doses of sildenafil used in these experiments
were much higher (100 mg/kg/d) than the doses typically
administered in the cardioprotection studies (0.71 – 1.4
mg/kg bid), emphasizing the need to carefully titrate drug
dosages in future experiments and clinical studies designed
to test the effect of pde5 inhibitors in cardiac pathology.

heart failure

pde5 inhibitors and platelets

there is now ample experimental evidence supporting a
potentially beneficial use of pde5 inhibitors in the treatment
of heart failure. cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling are
characterized by a concomitant increase in local pde5
activity and gene expression, in murine models and in human
patients [13, 80]. in contrast to its complete lack of effect in
normal hearts, sildenafil was shown to not only prevent
myocardial fibrosis and hypertrophy but to also reverse these
effects and increase contractility in hypertrophic hearts, even
upon delayed administration [81]. sildenafil also increased
protein kinase g – 1 (pkg-1) activity, reduced calcineurin
gene expression, blunted the activation of various downstream kinases previously linked to myocyte hypertrophy
( xxxg1369xxx /2, akt, pi3k) and improved ca2+ cycling in the
cardiomyocyte [80, 81], suggesting that ped5 inhibition
may prevent decline of the failing heart via multiple
pathways. indeed, an indirect, cgmp-mediated inhibition of
 xxxg1695xxx  activity has also been proposed [13], whereas
phenylephrine – induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy was
reportedly blunted by pde5 gene silencing, in a pkg –
dependent manner [82]. on the other hand, sildenafil failed
to prevent or reverse hypertrophy in an experimental model
of right ventricle hypertrophy [83].

increased production of cgmp leads to phosphorylation
of substrates that inhibit platelet activation while pde5 are
responsible for cgmp degradation in platelets [94]. it has
been shown that sildenafil participates in no-dependent
inhibition of in vitro platelet aggregation through cgmp and
could thus have a preventive role in the appearance of
cardiovascular disease [95]. moreover, sildenafil can inhibit
the in vitro secretory function of platelets at least in part
through cgmp–dependent inhibition of  xxxg1695xxx  and a subsequent increase in camp [96]. recently, wilson and
colleagues proposed that sildenafil exerts its effect in a
defined spatiotemporal manner through its close interaction
with protein kinase g1 beta (pkg1) [97].

cardioprotection
sildenafil was the first pde5 inhibitor shown to exert a
protective effect against ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the
hearts of rabbits [84], mice [85], rats [86] and dogs [87].
while this effect has been widely reproduced, a smaller
number of studies have attested to a similar cardioprotective
effect of vardenafil and tadalafil [88]. this effect appears to
be concentration-dependent; in the isolated working rat heart
model of ischaemia-reperfusion injury, sildenafil was
effective in the range of 10 – 50 nm but detrimental or
ineffective in affecting aortic output recovery and infarct size
when used at a higher (200 nm) concentration [89]. in a
similar model, vardenafil was effective in limiting infarct
size only  xxxd1891xxx  nm, but failed to protect at lower or higher
concentrations [90]. the reason behind this concentration
dependence is not clear but must be sought in the complex
pattern of downstream signals and feed-back loops activated
by ped5 inhibition. sildenafil-induced cardioprotection
apparently involves cgmp-dependent pkg activation and
the ensuing phosphorylation (activation) of  xxxg1369xxx /2, pi3k,
and akt kinases, eventually leading to gsk3 phosphorylation (inactivation), increased expression of the antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein and the inos/ enos enzymes and
activation of the inner mitochondrial membrane potassium
channels katp and kca [91-93]. in a heart failure mouse
model however, sildenafil acted to inhibit pressure overload

pde5 inhibitors and immune response
it has been shown recently that peritoneal exudate macrophages express pde5, among other pde types, and that
cgmp can play a critical role in macrophage signaling [98].
pde5 inhibition has also been proposed as a means of
enhancing anti-tumor immune response, as sildenafil was
shown to oppose immunosuppressive tumor escape
mechanisms by means of reducing the activity of myeloidderived suppressor cells as well as restoring proliferation of
blood mononuclear cells [99].
pde5 inhibitors and the gastrointestinal
system
in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum and colon of the rat,
50% of the phosphodiesterase activity was inhibited by
sildenafil citrate, and was, therefore, attributed to pde5.
both pde5a1 and pde5a2 splicomers were cloned from
human colonic t84 cells. sildenafil administration in rats
caused a fluid accumulation in colon loops providing a
possible explanation for the observed side effect of diarrhoea
in humans [100]. pde5 inhbitors are known to affect the
relaxation and contraction of smooth muscle in the gut [101].
inhibition of camp- and cgmp-phosphodiesterases (pde)
may be one of the mechanisms underlying the spasmolytic
action of chamomile [102]. sildenafil induced the myorelaxation of spontaneousy contracted rat duodenal strips in a
no-dependent manner, which was also influenced by k+
channel opening [103]. a study of sildenafil and zaprinast on
isolated human internal anal sphincter revealed that sildenafil
inhibited the histamine-induced tone in internal anal
sphincter strips, increasing the cgmp content, and
depressing the peak intracellular calcium increase evoked by
histamine, while zaprinaste also relaxed the muscle but with
lower potency [104]. also, pde5 inhibitors may be able to
enhance cgmp-dependent hco3- in the rat stomach [105].

pde5 inhibitors

pde5 inhibitors and vision
sildenafil selectively inhibits cyclic  xxxd1067xxx  (cgmp)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5
(pde5) but also exerts a considerable inhibitory effect on
pde6, in the rod and cone photoreceptors, explaining visual
– reversible -symptoms such as blue tinged or blurry vision
and increased brightness at high doses [106]. in addition,
pde5 participates in cgmp metabolism in retinal pigment
epithelial cells as sildenafil application to cell lines increased
cgmp levels in these cells[107]. yuan and colleagues
investigated the direct reaction of retinal arterioles to
sildenafil by measuring the diameter changes in retinal
arterioles from porcine eyes, in order to reveal the
underlying signaling pathway. they concluded, based on the
effect pharmacological probes, that the vasodilatory effect of
sildenafil can be attributed to direct activation of erk
signaling independently of and in addition to this drug’s
effect on pde5 activity [108]. in addition, tadalafil and
sildenafil were shown to modify the ophthalmic artery flow
velocity in healthy young subjects, in a time dependent
manner [109].
the use of pde5 inhibitors has been associated with a
condition called non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic
neuropathy (naion) which is characterized by sudden and
irreversible visual loss. however, whether this is a true
causal association is not clear at the moment [110, 111]. a
double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial on 20 young
healthy volunteers following a single high (100 mg) dose of
sildenafil, using various visual function tests, found that
sildenafil causes small but statistically significant changes in
retinal function, correlated with drug peak concentration. no
visual side effects were reported in this study however [112].
pde5 inhibitors and the nervous system
recently, many studies are focusing on the role of pdes
in the cns and on the potential use of pde inhibitors for
treatment of nervous system disorders. a possible
explanation is that pdes are present in various regions of the
cns and that camp and cgmp have been recognized as
secondary messengers of various neuronal phenomena [3,
113]. pde5 is found in specific cell types in several brain
regions including olfactory bulb, cortex, hippocampus,
substantia nigra, purkinje cells of the cerebellum, motor and
non-motor neurons of the spinal cord, and in adult stem cells
of the subventricular zone [3]. the possible use of these
drugs in the cns is also related to their ability to cross the
blood – brain barrier (bbb). sildenafil is reported to clearly
cross the bbb [114]. evidence for the ability of vardenafil to
cross the bbb is indirect [115], while there are no published
data concerning tadalafil.
pde5 inhibitors in synaptic plasticity, memory and
neurorestorative events
increases in cgmp levels enhance proliferation of
endothelial cells and motor neurons [116].thus, increased
cgmp production may facilitate neuroprotection and
neurorestorative events such as neurogenesis, angiogenesis,
and synaptic plasticity in various neurological disorders
[113, 117]. pde5 inhibitors can possibly increase central

vascular cgmp concentrations, illustrated by the effects of
sildenafil on enhancing memory in rats with hyperammonemia [118]; lowering seizure threshold in both humans and
mice [119, 120] and promoting neurogenesis in the subventricular zone of rats with ischemic stroke [121, 122]. the
neurogenic effect of sildenafil on subventricular zone cells is
associated with cgmp-induced activation of the pi-3k/akt
pathway [123].
inhibition of pde enzymes in rats results in memoryenhancing effects [124, 125]. sildenafil has been shown to
successfully reverse the learning impairment induced by
cholinergic muscarinic receptor blockade in rats [124].
sildenafil also influences long-term memory retention in
mice by modulating mechanisms involved in memory
storage [126]. moreover, the inhibition of pde5 improves
object memory [115] and counteracts spatial learning
impairment induced by nos inhibition and by blockade of
cholinergic muscarinic receptors in rats [125]. other studies
have shown that sildenafil produces a dose-dependent
improvement of memory in mice tested with elevated plus
maze [127]. sildenafil effects have also been tested on
selective auditory attention and verbal recognition memory
in humans [128]. elevations of intracellular levels of cgmp
in immune microglial cells following inhibition of pde5
results in a decrease in the release of various pro-inflammatory cytokines from lipopolysaccharide stimulated microglia [129]. these findings suggest a potential therapeutic role
of sildenafil as a cognitive enhancer for therapeutic treatment
of cholinergic dysfunction in age-related cognitive decline
and  xxxg178xxx .
pde5 inhibitors and ischemic stroke
sildenafil improves outcome in rats after stroke by
enhancing angiogenesis, neurogenesis and improving
neurologic function [130-132]. angiogenesis is mediated by
no via the no-cgmp pathway and synthesis of vascular
endothelial growth factor. treatment with sildenafil starting
at 24 hours after stroke significantly increased brain levels of
cgmp, evoked neurogenesis, and reduced neurological
deficits after the insult in both young adult and aged rats
[121, 133]. tadalafil also improved functional recovery in a
rat model of embolic stroke when administered after the
insult [134]. chronic treatment of stroke in spontaneously
hypertensive rats with  xxxd3464xxx , a new pde5 inhibitor,
increases cerebral blood flow in the ischemic brain, plasma
no, cgmp, and the total antioxidative status and attenuates
endothelial dysfunction [135].
another potential treatment option is vasospasm after
subarachnoid hemorrhage. animal and human studies
suggest that sildenafil has vasodilatory effects in normal
cerebral vessels and cerebral vessels after subarachnoid
hemorrhage-induced vasospasm [136, 137].
pde5 inhibitors in neurodegenerative diseases and pain
sildenafil improves ed in patients with parkinson
disease, multisystem atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and spinal
cord injury without any significant side effects [138-141].
the neuroprotective effect of sildenafil was investigated
using several animal models of parkinson's disease and it
was found that sildenafil did not prevent neurotoxicity

3470 current pharmaceutical design, 2009, vol. 15, no. 30

regardless of the treatment paradigms employed. however,
any deleterious effect on nigrostriatal dopamine neuron
function were not observed suggesting that it would not
accelerate da cell loss when used as a treatment for erectile
dysfunction in parkinson’s disease [142, 143]. in multiple
sclerosis patients a study showed a positive association
between sildenafil and quality of life of the patients assessed
by effective treatment of their ed [141]. recent studies also
proposed that sildenafil can be used for the treatment of pain
in animals [144-146] because of the peripheral accumulation
of cgmp via activation of the  xxxd1274xxx -pkg-k+ channel
pathway that it is likely to have a local antinociceptive effect
[147].
adverse reactions from the cns
headache
the side effect profiles for all of the pde5 inhibitors are
almost identical, headache being the most common, dosedependent side effect. headache is reported in up to 30% of
patients after sildenafil, 21% of patients after vardenafil, and
16% of patients after tadalafil and is the most frequent
reason for discontinuation of the pde5 inhibitors causing a
discontinuation rate of 1.2% after sildenafil 100 mg [148,
149]. sildenafil has been found to induce migraine in both
controls and patients with a migraine history [150]. it can
trigger cluster headaches and 3 cases have been reported in
the literature [151, 152]. plasma levels of calcitonin generelated peptide, cgmp, and camp have been implicated in
the pathogenesis of migraines, but are not elevated during
sildenafil-induced migraines [150]. sildenafil induced
migraines do not change the middle cerebellar arterys diameter, blood flow, or velocity, although these changes have
previously been described during non-sildenafil induced
migraines [153, 154]. concerning cerebral hemodynamics it
is postulated that the effect of sildenafil on cerebral arterial
diameter in the resting condition is not hemodynamically
significant because mean flow velocity and pulsatility index
remained constant [155]. sildenafil has not shown differences in cerebral blood flow velocity in normal subjects
under resting conditions [137]. a recent study in healty
females showed that sildenafil induces mild headache without potentiating a neuronal or local cerebrovascular visual
response or a global cerebrovascular hypercapnic response
[156].
furthermore, there have been reports of transient global
amnesia after pde5 inhibitor therapy. two cases followed
the first ingestion of sildenafil and tadalafil and another
occurred in a patient with a history of classic migraine [157159]. migraine is a risk factor and a precipitant for transient
global amnesia; thus, it is plausible to cautiously use pde5
inhibitors in patients suffering from migraine
stroke and intracranial hemorrhage
in patients with preexisting cerebrovascular disease,
sildenafil can cause lowering of blood pressures across a
disease artery resulting in transient ischemic attack and
subsequent stroke [160]. ischemic strokes in postmarketing
reports were potentially associated with sildenafil use, but
preexisting cerebrovascular disease was present in some of

kouvelas et al.

these patients [160, 161]. furthermore, in placebo-controlled
sildenafil studies, no association was found between
sildenafil and increased risk of stroke [162].
sildenafil use is also sporadically linked with intracranial
hemorrhage [163, 164]. a case reported a sildenafil-induced
subthalamic bleed, which presented as hemiballismus [165].
in vitro studies have shown that sildenafil may also target
pde1 and pde2, which are affecting cerebral vasculature,
however, no clear evidence explains the mechanism of
intracranial hemorrhage associated with sildenafil [166].
seizures
several cases of sildenafil-induced seizures have been
reported. four cases were reported during the clinical trials
of sildenafil [114]. since then, there were 2 reported cases of
tonic-clonic seizures after sildenafil therapy-both in men
with erectile dysfunction (ed) without previous seizure
history [119]. sildenafil causes a dose-dependent decrease in
the threshold for clonic, but not tonic seizures in mice
through nocgmp pathways [120]. therefore, with the
incidence of seizures in patients and mice studies using
sildenafil a patient’s seizure history should be established
before commencing sildenafil therapy.
neuropsychiatric and behavioural effects
milman and arnold presented data of adverse event
reports filed with the fda, that noted use of sildenafil [167].
of the 12 378 adverse event reports 274 reports listed
sildenafil as the primary suspect and noted various neurologic, psychiatric and behavioural disturbances. in the
majority of these reports more than one side effect was
reported. psychiatric side effects included anxiety, agitation,
attention disturbance, disorientation, abnormal thinking,
abnormal dreams, depression, mania, delirium, psychotic
symptoms, and aggressive behavior such as suicide or
attempted suicide and physical assault. neurologic side
effects described were confusion, dizziness, amnesia or loss
of consciousness.
clinical trials have also shown that sildenafil causes a
variety of cns adverse effects (<2%) including dizziness,
depression, insomnia, abnormal dreams, and nervousness
[114, 167]. furthermore, several anecdotal reports and case
studies have described psychological disturbances and
aggressive behavior with sildenafil use [168, 169]. it is not
known whether in humans sildenafil’s inhibition of pde5,
accumulation of cyclic- gmp, and reduction in the concentrations of no in specific brain regions (e.g. hippocampus,
cerebral cortex, basal ganglia) would lead to neuropsychiatric changes. however, animal studies of no and the
no–cgmp signaling pathway indicated that no modulates
aggression and sexual behavior in male mice [170, 171].
data is limited about the effect of sildenafil on the cns
after long-term use or about withdrawal states. standard
toxicological dose–response analysis suggests that those who
are given higher doses of sildenafil and for an extended
period of time, may be at a higher risk for potential adverse
effects [172]. experimentally, a significant increase in mice
aggressive behavior was observed the week immediately
following cessation of 4 weeks of treatment with a high dose

pde5 inhibitors

of sildenafil [173]. taken together, these findings suggest
that future biochemical, pharmacologic, and epidemiologic
studies are needed evaluating cns adverse effects and
investigating possible withdrawal and abuse effects of pde5
inhibitors.
conclusions and future perspectives
after the great success of pde5 inhibitors as drugs for
the treatment of erectile dysfunction and their remarkable
safety profile, the above drugs are promising for the treatment of numerous disorders. pde5 inhibitors are already
registered for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and
there is strong evidence for their beneficial action in heart
failure, cystic fibrosis, luts and neuroprotection. further
pre and clinical studies are required in order to evaluate the
pde5 inhibitors’ future pharmacological applications.
