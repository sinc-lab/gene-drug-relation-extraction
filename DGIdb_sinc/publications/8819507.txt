alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtype causing  xxxd2738xxx -mediated vascular relaxation in rats.  the alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtype and its signal transduction pathway mediating vascular relaxation in rats were studied in vitro using rings of superior mesenteric arteries. removal of endothelium or incubation with ng-nitro-l-arginine completely blocked relaxant responses to uk14,304, suggesting  xxxd2738xxx  mediates relaxation. the order of potency for full (f) or partial (p) agonists causing relaxation was  xxxd2241xxx  (p) > uk14,304 (f) > clonidine (p) > epinephrine (f) > norepinephrine (f). affinities (ka) of alpha-2 adrenoceptor subtype-selective drugs for blocking relaxation were obtained in side-by-side experiments comparing rat mesenteric arteries with pig coronary arteries. relaxation of pig coronary arteries is known to be mediated by the  xxxg88xxx  subtype. ka values in nm for rauwolscine (19), wb-4101 (265), skf-104078 (197), spiroxatrine (128), and  xxxd3000xxx  (1531) for blocking relaxation in rat arteries were consistent with their affinities for binding at the alpha-2d adrenoceptor subtype. ka values for rauwolscine and wb-4101, drugs distinguishing the alpha-2d from the  xxxg88xxx  subtype, were significantly higher in blocking relaxation of rat arteries compared with pig arteries, suggesting the alpha-2d adrenoceptor subtype mediates no-induced relaxation in rat arteries. we used  xxxd1742xxx  to oppose alpha-2 adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of camp formation by directly stimulating camp formation in endothelium.  xxxd1742xxx  did not affect the relaxant response to uk14,304, suggesting that camp is not involved in the coupling of alpha-2 adrenoceptors to  xxxd2738xxx -induced vascular relaxation.
