adult mice with targeted mutation of the  xxxg1182xxx  ( xxxg1163xxx ) display normal hematopoiesis.   xxxg1162xxx  ( xxxg1162xxx ) is a pleiotropic growth factor with a prominent effect on megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. the receptor for  xxxg1162xxx  is a heterodimer of the signal transduction unit gp130 and a specific receptor component, the alpha-chain (il-11r alpha). two genes potentially encode the il-11r alpha: the  xxxg1163xxx  and il11ra2 genes. the  xxxg1163xxx  gene is widely expressed in hematopoietic and other organs, whereas the il11ra2 gene is restricted to only some strains of mice and its expression is confined to testis, lymph node, and thymus. to investigate the essential actions mediated by the il-11r alpha, we have generated mice with a null mutation of  xxxg1163xxx  ( xxxg1163xxx -/-) by gene targeting. analysis of  xxxg1163xxx  expression by northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, as well as the absence of response of  xxxg1163xxx -/- bone marrow cells to  xxxg1162xxx  in hematopoietic assays, further confirmed the null mutation. compensatory expression of the il11ra2 in bone marrow cells was not detected.  xxxg1163xxx -/- mice were healthy with normal numbers of peripheral blood white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelets. bone marrow and spleen contained normal numbers of cells of all hematopoietic lineages, including megakaryocytes. clonal cultures did not identify any perturbation of granulocyte-macrophage (gm), erythroid, or megakaryocyte progenitors. the number of day-12 colony-forming unit-spleen progenitors were similar in wild-type and  xxxg1163xxx -/- mice. the kinetics of recovery of peripheral blood white blood cells, platelets, and bone marrow gm progenitors after treatment with 5- xxxd2134xxx  were the same in  xxxg1163xxx -/- and wild-type mice. acute hemolytic stress was induced by phenylhydrazine and resulted in a 50% decrease in hematocrit. the recovery of hematocrit was comparable in  xxxg1163xxx -/ - and wild-type mice. these observations indicate that  xxxg1162xxx  receptor signalling is dispensable for adult hematopoiesis.
