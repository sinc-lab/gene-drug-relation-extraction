abstract
aim: to compare the composition of  xxxd2154xxx  (fas) in diet,
and the expression of  xxxg758xxx  ( xxxg758xxx ) and delta-5
desaturase ( xxxg757xxx ) genes in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (pbmcs) between chinese and europeans. methods:
three-day dietary records from 20 subjects from beijing, china (n = 10) and kent, uk (n = 10) were analysed. expression
of pbmc  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes of the subjects was determined
using rt-pcr. results: the dietary intake of chinese subjects contained less saturated  xxxd2154xxx  (sfas) and monounsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (mufas), but more essential fatty
acids (efas) than that of europeans. levels of expression of
pbmc  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes of chinese subjects were significantly lower than those of europeans. a significant positive correlation was found between dietary intake of total
sfas and total mufas and expression of pbmc  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx 
genes, but a significant negative correlation between dietary intake of linoleic acid (la) and - xxxd2490xxx  (lna)
and the expression of pbmc  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes. conclusion: intake of high sfas and mufas appears to increase expression of pbmc  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes, whilst high efas in-

introduction

long-chain polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (lc-pufas)
are essential dietary nutrients required for optimal human growth and development [1–6]. lc-pufas such as
 xxxd208xxx  (aa, c20: 4 6) and docosahexaenoic
acid (dha, c22:63) are accumulated in the developing
brain and retina, which are important constituents in the
nervous system [7, 8]. thus, dha is selectively enriched
in the rods and cones of the retina, brain grey matter, and
heart muscle phospholipids. aa is a major fatty acid component of lymphocyte membrane phospholipids and essential to the functional integrity of lymphocytes and
other leucocytes [9]. in humans, aa and dha can be
synthesised from the precursors of lc-pufas, i.e. linoleic acid (la, c18: 2 6) and - xxxd2490xxx  (lna,
 xxxd2490xxx 3), through delta-6 desaturation, elongation and
delta-5 desaturation, etc. two rate-limiting enzymes,
 xxxg758xxx  ( xxxg758xxx ) and  xxxg757xxx  ( xxxg757xxx ),

are involved in the production of the polyunsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (pufas).  xxxg758xxx  desaturates la and lna to  xxxd2490xxx  ( xxxd2490xxx  6) and stearidonic acid (c18:43)
respectively, then  xxxg757xxx  desaturates dihomo--linolenic
acid (c20: 3 6) and eicosatetraenoic acid (c20: 43) to
aa and  xxxd2318xxx  (epa, c20:53), respectively. both enzymes are coordinately regulated by various dietary conditions [10, 11] and hormonal levels [12,
13]. for instance,  xxxg758xxx  activity is highly suppressed by
dietary pufas such as la, which indicates that these enzymes may be involved in feedback regulation in the production of lc-pufas [14]. the cloning of mammalian
 xxxg757xxx  and  xxxg758xxx  cdnas has increased our understanding
of the molecular basis of the nutritional regulation of
these desaturases [15, 16], for example suppression of
 xxxg757xxx  and  xxxg758xxx  activities by dietary pufas was shown to
be associated with decreased  xxxg757xxx  and  xxxg758xxx  mrna levels
[15, 16]. in addition, human peripheral blood leucocytes
have been extensively studied in relation to essential fatty
acids (efas) and eicosanoid metabolism, and gene expression both in health and disease [9, 17–22]. since the
chinese have dietary habits that differ substantially from
europeans, we compared, in this study, the composition
of  xxxd2154xxx  (fas) in the diet and expression of  xxxg757xxx  and
 xxxg758xxx  genes between chinese and european subjects. the
fas intake of the chinese and european subjects, and the
levels of expression of  xxxg757xxx  and  xxxg758xxx  genes in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) were examined.

subjects and methods
study material was collected from students in beijing medical
school, peking university, beijing, china (n = 10) and the university of greenwich at medway, kent, uk (n = 10). none of them
showed any evidence of acute or chronic disease. the characteristics of the subjects are given in table 1.

chinese and europeans

dietary intake of the subjects
a 3-day dietary record was obtained for each subject who was
instructed how to measure and record his/her diet. the total intake of food and fluid was recorded by the subject. the records
were analysed and the intake of  xxxd2154xxx  was calculated using
chinese food tables [23] and the composition of foods as described by mccance and widdowson [24, 25].
collection of blood samples and isolation of pbmcs
venous blood (10 ml) was taken by venipuncture from the subjects after an overnight fast. whole blood was anticoagulated with
heparin. there was no difference in the blood differential count
between the chinese and european subjects. all cells and plasma
were separated from the blood by centrifuging for 10 min at 700 g.
the cells were diluted with an equal volume of rpmi-1640 (sigma, uk), then layered onto lymphoprep (axis-shield poc as,
norway) and further centrifuged at 450 g for 30 min and then left
standing for 20 min. the pbmcs were removed gently from the
interface and washed twice using rpmi-1640. the final pbmcs’
pellet was suspended in 1 ml rpmi-1640 supplemented with
2 mm l-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin (sigma, uk). the number of pbmcs was counted using a hemocytometer. over 95% viability of the pbmcs was judged by
trypan blue exclusion. to 2 ! 106 pbmcs were added 50% rpmi1640 (supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 u/ml penicillin
and 100 g/ml streptomycin), 50% autologous plasma and 10%
dmso, and stored at –70 ° c. the frozen chinese pbmcs were
transported to the centre for biosciences research at the school
of science, university of greenwich. the european pbmcs were
collected and stored at the same centre.
rna isolation and rt-pcr
the rna was isolated from the pbmcs using the qiagen
rneasy mini kit (qiagen ltd. uk). the resultant rna was spectrophotometrically quantified using a spectrophotometer (uv160a, uv-visible recording spectrophotometer, shimadzu, japan), and the ratio of 260/280 was greater than 1.9.
the expression of  xxxg758xxx  or  xxxg757xxx  gene was assessed on 40 ng
rna using the qiagen one-step rt-pcr kit (qiagen ltd., uk).
primers which covered a splice junction and therefore amplified
only cdna and not genomic dna were used. the primers sequences used were:
(i) for  xxxg758xxx : sense 5-ggcactacgctggagaagat-3 and
antisense 5-gccagttcaccaatcagcag-3 (modified and
designed from a reference paper) [26];
(ii) for  xxxg757xxx : sense 5-ccagacatcaacatgcatcc-3 and
antisense 5-taatcatccaggccaagtcc-3 (modified and
designed from a reference paper) [16], and
(iii) for 18s rrna: sense 5-tcaagaacgaaagtcggagg3 and antisense 5-ggacatctaagggcatcaca-3 as a housekeeping gene and internal control [27].
the one-step protocol of rt-pcr was performed by using a
pcr thermal cycler (genus, techne ltd. uk), and the procedure
was as follows:
(i) 30 min reverse transcription at 50 ° c;
(ii) 15 min initial pcr activation step at 95 ° c;
(iii) optimised cycles depending on the target ( xxxg758xxx , 30 cycles;
 xxxg757xxx , 35 cycles; 18s rrna, 25 cycles) of 30 s at 94 ° c (denaturation), 30 s at 58 ° c (annealing), 1 min at 72 ° c (extension), and
(iv) finally 10 min at 72 ° c (final extension).

results obtained confirmed that every pcr product was performed within the linear phase of the pcr amplified reaction.
each sample was electrophoresed on 1.5% agarose gel and stained
with ethidium bromide. the intensity of the ethidium bromide
luminescence was digitally captured using a gel documentation
system (bioimaging systems, uvp ltd., uk) and analysed using
the labworks software (media cybernetics inc., uvp ltd., uk,
2003). values are given as relative units (ru) [28] and were calculated as follows:

statistics
the results are presented as the mean 8 sem. statistical differences between the two groups were calculated using student’s
t test. p ! 0.05 was considered significant. pearson correlation
coefficients were determined, and regression analysis was performed.
ethical approval
the study was approved by both the ethics committees of the
academic committees of the third hospital, peking university,
china, and the university of greenwich, uk.

results

dietary and  xxxd2154xxx  intake
the chinese staple food was rice, noodles, chinese
cabbage, bean curd, chicken and pork. the european staple food was bread, pasta, potato, milk, yogurt and cheese.
the dietary intakes are shown in table 2. the chinese
diet had higher carbohydrate but lower fat to contribute
energy than the european diet. in the chinese diet, fat
was primarily derived from  xxxd3230xxx  and pork, whilst
that in the european diet from cheese, meat, spreads and
cooking oils. the mean daily intake of the  xxxd2154xxx  is
given in table 3. all saturated  xxxd2154xxx  (sfas) in the
chinese diet, except behenic acid (c22:0), were signifi494

cantly lower than those in the european diet. furthermore, in the chinese subjects, the intake of all monounsaturated  xxxd2154xxx  (mufas), except pentadecenoic acid
(c15:1), was significantly lower than that in the european
subjects. however, the total intake of polyunsaturated
 xxxd2154xxx  (pufas) of the chinese subjects was significantly higher than that of the european subjects. among
pufas, the intake of la, eicosadienoic acid (c20:2 6),
adrenic acid (c22:4 6), lna, and total  6 pufas was
significantly higher in the chinese subjects than that in
the european subjects. on the other hand, the intake of
c18: 3 6, c20: 3 6, aa, c18: 43, epa, clupanodonic
acid (c22:53) and dha was significantly lower in the
chinese than that in the european subjects.
expression of  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes
the expression of  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes is given in figure 1 and table 4. the levels of the expression of  xxxg758xxx  and
 xxxg757xxx  genes in the chinese subjects were significantly lower, approximately 5 fold, than those in the european subjects.
relationship between dietary intake and expression
of  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes
the dietary intake of total sfas was positively correlated with the levels of expression of  xxxg758xxx  (r = 0.88, p !
0.001) and  xxxg757xxx  (r = 0.80, p ! 0.001) genes in the chinese
plus european subjects, as shown in figures 2 and 3. furthermore, total mufas in the diet were also positively
correlated with the levels of expression of  xxxg758xxx  (r = 0.85,
p ! 0.001) and  xxxg757xxx  (r = 0.60, p = 0.01) genes in the
chinese plus european subjects (fig. 4, 5). there were
very similar correlations between the ratios of sfas to
mufas and the levels of expression of  xxxg758xxx  (r = 0.62, p =
0.01) and  xxxg757xxx  (r = 0.79, p ! 0.001) genes in the chinese
plus european subjects. however, the intake of la was
negatively correlated with the levels of expression of  xxxg758xxx

discussion

the diet of the chinese subjects who ate large quantities of cereals was relatively high in carbohydrate and low
in fat. the chinese subjects had a lower intake of saturated and monounsaturated fats and a higher intake of la
and lna, which is reflected in the lower amount of enxiang /rahman /ai /li /harbige

ergy from fats and the main source of fat being soybean
oil. the european subjects, on the other hand, had higher
intakes of saturated and monounsaturated fats and lower
intakes of la and lna, which is reflected in the higher
amount of energy from fats and the main source of fat being cheese and meat. the european subjects also had
higher intakes of 6 and 3 lc-pufas. the higher intakes of la and lna and lower intakes of lc-pufas in
the chinese subjects were associated with lower pbmcs
 xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  gene expression compared with the european subjects’ pbmcs. indeed there was a significant negative correlation between the dietary intake of la and
lna and the expression of  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes. this observation is in agreement with studies in animals, where
 xxxg758xxx  expression is reduced by la-rich corn oil or safflower oil feeding [15, 16, 29, 30]. furthermore, in the present
study a significant positive correlation was found between
dietary intake of total sfas and mufas intake and the
expression of  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes. this is also in agreement with animal studies where saturated fat intake (e.g.
butter) increased the activity of  xxxg758xxx  [31] and is used to
induce essential fatty acid (efa) deficiency [32]. the effect of mufa is, however, a new and interesting finding.
thus, despite higher 6 and 3 lc-pufa intake and low
precursors availability in the european subjects, they had
higher pbmc  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  gene expression compared
to the chinese. furthermore, this appears to be related to
the high sfa and mufa intake in the europeans. it is
possible that the higher pbmc  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  gene
expression in the europeans is an attempt by the pbmc
to maintain aa levels, which is essential for the functions of these cells [9] by active desaturation of la and
c20:36.

factors other than dietary fats could also account for,
or contribute to, the differences in chinese and european
subjects’ pbmcs  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  gene expression such as
zinc status and lifestyle, e.g. exercise and smoking, as well
as genetic factors. therefore, a follow-up study of the levels of expression of  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx  genes of chinese who
live in european countries with western diets would be
interesting. the expression of pbmcs  xxxg758xxx  and  xxxg757xxx 
genes in chinese and european subjects correlated with
differences in dietary fat intake, and there are known differences in the expression of these genes among different
tissues [15, 16], therefore, pbmcs may also be a useful,
easily available and sensitive marker of the response of
these genes to dietary fats.
in conclusion, the availability of 20- and 22-carbon  6
and 3 pufas is determined by the synthesis of  xxxd2490xxx  6
and c18:43 and by the subsequent elongation and desaturation of these  xxxd2154xxx  to aa and epa [33]. the
conversion of la and lna to  xxxd2490xxx  6 and c18:43 respectively is determined by the enzymatic activity of
 xxxg758xxx , whereas the desaturation of c20:3 6 and  xxxd208xxx 3
is determined by the activity of  xxxg757xxx . in pbmcs  xxxg758xxx  and
 xxxg757xxx  genes expression was lower in chinese compared
with european subjects, which correlated negatively with
la and lna intakes and positively with sfas and
mufas intakes.
