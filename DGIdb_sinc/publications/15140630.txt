abstract
the chronic constriction injury model is a rat model of neuropathic pain based on a unilateral loose ligation of the sciatic nerve. the aim of the
present study was to test its sensitivity to various clinically validated and experimental drugs. mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia
developed within one week post-surgery and were reliably present for at least 7 weeks. mechanical allodynia was strongly attenuated by
morphine (minimal effective dose in brackets: 8 mg/kg, p.o.) and the cannabinoids d9-tetrahydrocannabinol (3 mg/kg, p.o.) and ( )-cis-3-[2hydroxy-4(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)  xxxd1776xxx  (cp 55,940; 0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), and weakly/moderately
attenuated by the anticonvulsants gabapentin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) and carbamazepine (32 mg/kg, i.p.), the muscle relaxant baclofen (3 mg/kg, i.p.),
and the  xxxg79xxx  inhibitor 4-amino-5-(3-bromophenyl)-7-(6-morpholino-pyridin-3-yl) xxxd3047xxx [2,3-d]pyrimidine (abt-702; 30 mg/kg,
i.p.). thermal hyperalgesia was strongly attenuated by morphine (16 mg/kg, p.o.), d9-tetrahydrocannabinol (6 mg/kg, p.o.), cp 55,940 (0.025
mg/kg, i.p.), carbamazepine (32 mg/kg, i.p.) and the antidepressant amitriptyline (32 mg/kg, p.o.), and weakly/moderately attenuated by
gabapentin (50 mg/kg, i.p.), the anti-inflammatory  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor rofecoxib (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and the  xxxg81xxx  positive
allosteric modulator 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo(b)thiophen-3-yl 4-chlorophenylmethanone (t62; 30 mg/kg, i.p.). both symptoms were
hardly or not affected by the nonselective n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists ketamine and dizocilpine, and the n-methyl-d-aspartate
receptor nr2b-selective antagonists  xxxd2326xxx  and r-(r*,s*)-a-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-h-methyl-4-(phenyl-methyl)-1-piperidine propranol (ro
25-6981). the finding that mechanical allodynia and/or thermal hyperalgesia are attenuated by various established compounds further supports
the validity of the chronic constriction injury model for the study of neuropathic pain and its use for the identification of novel treatments.

1. introduction
chronic neuropathic pain resulting from peripheral nerve
injury is characterized by pathological symptoms, such as
hyperalgesia and allodynia to mechanical and thermal (heat
or cold) stimuli, as well as spontaneous pain, and is
generally considered to respond relatively poorly to pharmacotherapy (koltzenburg, 1998; sindrup and jensen,
1999). in order to study the neurobiological mechanisms
underlying the development of neuropathic pain and to find
novel and potentially more effective treatments, a number of
rat models have been developed during the last decade

(martin and eisenach, 2001). these models are based on
either a unilateral ligation of the sciatic or spinal nerves (i.e.,
the chronic constriction injury model, bennett and xie,
1988; the partial sciatic nerve injury model, seltzer et al.,
1990; and the spinal nerve ligation model, kim and chung,
1992), or on a unilateral transection of one or more of the
three distal branches of the sciatic nerve (i.e., the spared
nerve injury model, decosterd and woolf, 2000; and the
tibial nerve injury model, hofmann et al., 2003).
the chronic constriction injury model appears to be one
of the most frequently used models for the study of
neuropathic pain and its treatment. the model, which is
based on a unilateral loose ligation of the sciatic nerve,
shows many of the pathophysiological properties of chronic
neuropathic pain in human subjects (bennett and xie,
1988). it also shows a relatively high degree of similarity
with other models of neuropathic pain in terms of the time-

138

j. de vry et al. / european journal of pharmacology 491 (2004) 137–148

course and the degree of allodynia and hyperalgesia against
mechanical and/or thermal stimuli, the occurrence of spontaneous pain, and its sensitivity to sympathectomy (for
discussion and references, see bridges et al., 2001; hofmann et al., 2003). in addition, the chronic constriction
injury model has been demonstrated to be sensitive to a
number of compounds which are used clinically for the
symptomatic treatment of chronic neuropathic pain (for
review of clinical efficacy, see sindrup and jensen, 1999).
thus, it was reported that hyperalgesic and/or allodynic
reactions to thermal and/or mechanical stimuli could be
attenuated by the opiate morphine (attal et al., 1991; koch
et al., 1996; pelissier et al., 2003), the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline (koch et al., 1996), the anticonvulsants
gabapentin (boyce et al., 1999; hunter et al., 1997; xiao
and bennett, 1996) and carbamazepine (koch et al., 1996),
the muscle relaxant baclofen (smith et al., 1994), and the
dissociative anaesthetic ketamine (pelissier et al., 2003). it
should be noted, however, that these reference compounds
were mostly studied singularly (i.e., in separate studies), and
that their efficacy was assessed under different experimental
conditions and against different modalities using different
behavioral readouts. due to this lack of standardization, the
relative potency and efficacy of these compounds remains
unclear, making it more difficult to appraise the potential of
novel experimental compounds. recently, the pharmacological sensitivity to a number of reference compounds as
assessed under standardized conditions has been reported
for the spared nerve injury model (erichsen and blackburnmunro, 2002) and the tibial nerve injury model (hofmann et
al., 2003).
the aim of the present study was to assess the pharmacological sensitivity of the chronic constriction injury model
to the reference compounds mentioned above, as well as the
novel anti-inflammatory  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor rofecoxib (chan et al., 1999), and to a number of experimental
compounds which were reported to have antihyperalgesic
and/or anti-allodynic properties in this model or in other
model(s) of neuropathic pain. the experimental compounds
included the cannabinoids d9-tetrahydrocannabinol (gaoini
and mechoulam, 1964) and ( )-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4(1,1dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)  xxxd1776xxx  (cp 55,940, johnson and melvin, 1986), the
 xxxg79xxx  inhibitor 4-amino-5-(3-bromophenyl)-7(6-morpholino-pyridin-3-yl) xxxd3047xxx [2,3-d]pyrimidine (abt702, kowaluk et al., 2000) and the  xxxg81xxx 
positive allosteric modulator 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo(b)thiophen-3-yl 4-chlorophenylmethanone (t62; li
et al., 2002), the nonselective n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor
antagonist dizocilpine (mk-801, wong et al., 1986), and the
n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor nr2b-selective antagonists
 xxxd2326xxx  (avenet et al., 1997) and r-(r*, s*)-a-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-h-methyl-4-(phenyl-methyl)-1-piperidine propranol (ro 25-6981, mutel et al., 1998). efficacy of the
compounds against thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical
allodynia was assessed after acute administration. in order

to estimate the specificity of the antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effect, behavioral reactivity was also tested at the
contralateral non-operated paw. an antihyperalgesic or antiallodynic effect was considered to be specific if it could be
demonstrated that it occurred at a dose which did not affect
reactivity of the non-operated paw.

2. materials and methods
2.1. animals and housing conditions
male wistar rats (180 –200 g; strain hsdcpb:wu) were
housed in groups of two in makrolonr type 3 cages (22 
37 cm, height 15 cm) under standardized conditions. room
temperature and relative humidity were maintained at
22 f 1jc and 55 f 5%, respectively, and lights were on
from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. conventional rat chow (type
1324, altromin, lage, germany) and tap water were given
ad libitum. animals could adapt to the laboratory conditions
for at least 1 week before surgery took place. experimental
protocols and conditions conformed to the local regulations
on animal welfare and to the ethical guidelines of the
international association for the study of pain (zimmermann, 1983).
2.2. surgery
the method described by bennett and xie (1988) was
generally followed. rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital (nembutal, sanofi, libourne, france; 50 mg/kg, i.p.).
the right common sciatic nerve was exposed at the level of
the middle of the thigh by blunt dissection through the
biceps femoris. proximal to the sciatic’s trifurcation, about
12 mm of nerve was freed of adhering tissue and four
ligatures (100% mercerized cotton thread; strength: 40)
were tied loosely around it with about 1 mm spacings.
the length of nerve thus affected was 6 –8 mm long. great
care was taken to tie the ligatures such that the diameter of
the nerve was seen to be just barely constricted when
viewed with 40  magnification. the desired degree of
constriction retarded, but did not arrest, circulation through
the superficial epineural vasculature and sometimes produced a small, brief twitch in the muscle surrounding the
exposure. the incision was closed in layers. in shamoperated controls, an identical operation was performed on
the same side, except that the sciatic nerve was not ligated.
2.3. assessment of mechanical allodynia and thermal
hyperalgesia
mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia were
assessed bilaterally as described by hofmann et al. (2003).
prior to behavioral testing, the animals were accustomed to
the test cages for 5 min. mechanical allodynia was measured
by means of a pressure transducer (electronic von frey

j. de vry et al. / european journal of pharmacology 491 (2004) 137–148

anaesthesiometer, iitc-life science instruments, woodland hills, ca). animals were placed in a test cage with a
wire mesh floor, and the tip of the anaesthesiometer was
applied to the middle of the plantar surface of the operated
and the non-operated hindpaw. withdrawal threshold was
measured once per trial and expressed as tolerance level in
grams. thermal sensitivity of the hindpaws was measured
using the plantar test (ugo basile, comerio, italy) as
described by hargreaves et al. (1988). animals were placed
in plastic cages on the surface of a glass plate. the heat
stimulus was applied from beneath, to the middle of the
plantar surface by means of a radiant heat source. thermal
sensitivity was recorded once per trial as withdrawal latency
in seconds with a cutoff time of 32 s.
before the start of the pharmacological experiments,
mechanical and thermal sensitivity was assessed in a group
of ligated (n = 18) and sham-operated (n = 7) rats, tested
repeatedly at different time points following surgery (i.e.,
days 8 – 12, 13 –17, 20– 22, 25 – 29, 30 –34 and 45 – 50 postsurgery). in order to avoid additional stress shortly after the
surgical procedures, pain tests were not performed during
the initial week post-surgery.
2.4. pharmacological testing
pharmacological testing was performed between week 1
and week 5 post-surgery and generally occurred in different
collectives of ligated groups (and their sham-operated controls). baseline thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia was checked on the day before pharmacological
testing, in order to ascertain behavioral pathology. baseline
values were considered to be valid if the plantar test values
were around 20 and 10 s in the sham and ligated groups,
respectively, and the von frey test values were around 70
and 35 g, respectively. animals which reliably showed both
symptoms were selected for pharmacological testing on the
next day. each group included for pharmacological testing
consisted of 9 –14 rats (receiving either vehicle, or one of
two to three doses of a compound).
the effect of acute administration of morphine (8, 16 and
32 mg/kg, p.o. t = 60 min; one experiment took place 6 –9
days post-surgery; a replication was performed in a separate
group of rats, 13– 17 days post-surgery), amitriptyline (32,
64 and 128 mg/kg, p.o., t = 60 min; 6 – 12 days postsurgery), baclofen (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p., t = 30 min;
20 –23 post-surgery), gabapentin (50 and 100 mg/kg, i.p.,
t = 60 min; 27– 31 days post-surgery), carbamazepine (16,
32 and 64 mg/kg, i.p., t = 30 min; 19 – 23 days post surgery),
d9 tetrahydrocannabinol (3 and 6 mg/kg, p.o., t = 60 min;
each dose tested in a separate experiment performed 26 –30
and 32 – 37 days post-surgery, respectively), cp 55,940
(0.025, 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p., t = 30 min; 9– 17 days
post-surgery), rofecoxib (10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o., t = 60 min;
26 –30 days post surgery), abt 702 (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg,
i.p., t = 30 min; 5 –9 days post-surgery), t62 (15 and 30 mg/
kg, i.p., t = 90 min; 18– 23 days post surgery), ketamine (5,

139

10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p., t = 30 min; 5 –10 days post surgery),
dizocilpine (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p., t = 30 min; 13–
17 days post surgery),  xxxd2326xxx  (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.,
t = 30 min; 25– 30 days post surgery), and ro 25 6981 (5, 10
and 20 mg/kg, i.p., t = 30 min; 13 –16 days post-surgery)
was tested after ligation, and compared with the effect of
administration of the respective vehicle in an accompanying
group of ligated- and sham-operated control rats.

withdrawal threshold data obtained at the paw of the
right, operated hindlimb indicated a main treatment effect;
f(1,23) = 187.70, p < 0.001 and f(1,23) = 829.69,
p < 0.001, respectively). mean (s.e.m.) reaction latencies
obtained at the left, non-operated, paw ranged from 20.0
(1.2) to 25.0 (1.4) across the different time points in the
ligated group, and were not significantly different from
the latency values obtained in the sham-operated group,
which ranged from 17.1 (1.3) to 26.4 (2.7) ( f(1,23) =
0.47, p > 0.05). withdrawal threshold values obtained at the
left paw were slightly lower in the sham-operated group
[range: 58.9 (7.5) – 85.4 (11.5)], as compared with the ligated
group [range: 80.9 (3.4) – 91.4 (3.7); f(1,23) = 18.67,
p < 0.001]. overall, these data indicate that there was no
evidence for the occurrence of contralateral hyperalgesic or
allodynic effects.

3.1. general behavior

3.3. pharmacological testing

after ligation, occasional uplifting of the affected paw
was observed and all animals tended to avoid to stand on it.
uplifting of the rats resulted in stretching of the toes of the
unaffected limb (as observed in naive rats); whereas the
affected paw remained closed. general behavior and social
interactions were not obviously changed compared with
naive and sham-operated rats, and autotomy of the operated
limb was very rare ( < 2% of all ligated rats; these animals
were discarded from the experiments). body weight developed normally and identically in all groups.

across all pharmacological tests, mean (s.e.m.) baseline reaction latencies after thermal stimulation of the left,
non-operated paw as assessed in the different groups on the
day preceding the test day ranged from 17.2 (1.8) to 23.3
(1.8), and, for each compound tested, were not statistically
different from each other (outcome of anovas always
p > 0.05). mean (s.e.m.) baseline reaction latencies of the
right paw ranged from 7.8 (0.5) to 12.8 (0.7) across all
ligated groups, and ranged from 18.9 (1.9) to 23.3 (1.8)
across all sham-operated groups. for each compound
tested, anova of the right paw reaction latencies indicated a main group effect (outcome of anovas always
p < 0.001). post hoc analysis indicated that all ligated
groups differed significantly from the respective shamoperated group (always p < 0.001), but did not differ from
each other (always p > 0.05). also with respect to mechanical stimulation, baseline withdrawal threshold values

the different experiments were pooled for data analysis and
graphical presentation. the lowest dose which resulted in a
statistically significant ( p < 0.05) effect, as compared with
vehicle treatment, was considered to be the minimal effective dose (med). efficacy was calculated as the difference
of the mean values obtained in the drug- and the vehicletreated ligated groups, expressed as a percentage of the
difference of the mean values obtained in the vehicle-treated
sham-operated group and the vehicle-treated ligated group.
whenever efficacy level surpassed 50%, least-square linear
regression analysis was used to estimate effective dose50
(ed50) values and the corresponding 95% confidence limits
after log-probit conversion of the data.

3.2. thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia: time
dependency
thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia developed within one week following surgery, and lasted for at
least 7 weeks (fig. 1; anova of the reaction latency and

ranged from 65.3 (3.4) to 86.7 (3.1)]. mean (s.e.m.)

across all ligated groups, and ranged from 65.5 (3.1) to

compound tested, anova of the right paw threshold

efficacy was 69%, obtained at both 16 and 32 mg/kg
(table 3). with respect to the anti-allydonic effect, the
med was 8 mg/kg and the maximal efficacy was 75%, at
32 mg/kg. morphine less potently also affected reaction
latency to thermal stimulation and the withdrawal threshold after mechanical stimulation when the non-operated
paw was tested (data not shown; outcome of anova in
tables 1 and 2, respectively). post hoc analysis indicated
that the reaction latency was increased at 32 mg/kg (mean

was increased at both 16 and 32 mg/kg (mean threshold of

4. discussion
the present study assessed the pharmacological sensitivity of the chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic

pain under standardized experimental conditions. thermal
hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia developed within
one week post-surgery and were reliably present for at least
7 weeks. both symptoms were attenuated to variable
degrees by a number of compounds used clinically for the
symptomatic treatment of neuropathic pain, as well as by
some experimental compounds previously reported to be
effective in animal models of neuropathic pain.

the present study further validates the chronic constriction injury model for the study of neuropathic pain and
supports its use for the identification of novel treatments.
the finding that thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical
allodynia were reliably present for at least 7 weeks postsurgery is consistent with the original report by bennett and
xie (1988). when both symptoms were assessed in the tibial
nerve injury model of neuropathic pain using the same
methodology as in the present study, it was found that
mechanical allodynia was more reliably present than thermal hyperalgesia (hofmann et al., 2003). this supports the
notion that the pathophysiological processes underlying the
development and maintenance of thermal hyperalgesia after
nerve ligation and disection are, at least partially, different
(for discussion, see bridges et al., 2001). in addition, it was
found that ligation induced no contralateral effects, as
evidenced by similar reaction latency and withdrawal
threshold values upon thermal and mechanical stimulation
of the non-operated paw. this was also reported in the
original description of the model (bennett and xie, 1988),
and contrasts with the presence of contralateral effects in the
spared nerve injury model (erichsen and blackburn-munro,
2002; but see decosterd and woolf, 2000), the partial sciatic
nerve injury model (seltzer et al., 1990), and the spinal
nerve ligation model (kim and chung, 1992).

acute oral administration of the opioid morphine almost
completely reversed thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical
allodynia. antihyperalgesic and anti-allodynic properties
were also reported in the same model when the compound
was administered by other routes of administration (e.g.,
attal et al., 1991; koch et al., 1996; pelissier et al., 2003).
although it is still controversial whether opiates are clinically effective against neuropathic pain (for discussion, see
dellemijn, 1999), it should be noted that the antihyperalgesic and anti-allodynic efficacy of morphine, as obtained in
the present study, showed some degree of specificity.
indeed, for both symptoms it could be demonstrated that
the compound more potently (about twofold) affected behavioral sensitivity of the ligated paw, than that of the nonoperated paw. this suggests that the antihyperalgesic and
anti-allodynic properties of morphine were not confounded
by antinociceptive or anaesthetic properties (or behavioral
side-effects).
although the tricyclic antidepressant amitrityline and the
muscle relaxant baclofen were both active in the model,
their profile of activity was different from each other and
from that of morphine. thus, whereas amitriptyline was
only effective against thermal hyperalgesia, baclofen was
found to be only active against mechanical allodynia. smith
et al. (1994) also reported efficacy of baclofen against

fig. 7. effect of ketamine (i.p., t = 30 min, n = 12 per group) and dizocilpine (i.p., t = 30 min, n = 11 – 12 per group; at the two highest doses behavioral sideeffects precluded testing) on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia after chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. doses are expressed in mg/kg
and are indicated in brackets. ###p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated sham-operated group.

mechanical allodynia in the same model, whereas amitriptyline was found to be effective against mechanical hyperalgesia (koch et al., 1996). efficacy of these compounds
against chronic pain symptoms was relatively specific, as
reactivity of the non-operated paw was less potently
(twofold for amitriptyline, see also koch et al., 1996; at
least twofold for baclofen) affected than reactivity of the
ligated paw.
the anticonvulsants gabapentin and carbamazepine induced a relatively similar profile of activity, as they both
showed significant antihyperalgesic and anti-allodynic properties in the same dose range. gabapentin was previously
reported to be effective in this model, although, as in the
present study, the magnitude of the effect appeared to be
relatively weak, with a relatively small therapeutic window
(sedation occurs at twice the med; boyce et al., 1999;
hunter et al., 1997; xiao and bennett, 1996). also for
carbamazepine, antihyperalgesic properties were reported in
this model (koch et al., 1996), but, again, the therapeutic
window appeared to be relatively small (severe behavioral
side-effects confounded testing at the highest dose).
the dissociative anaesthetics and nonselective n-methyld-aspartate receptor antagonists ketamine and dizocilpine
failed to show efficacy in the tested dose range. although
pelissier et al. (2003) reported an antihyperalgesic effect for
ketamine in this model, its magnitude was relatively weak

and only obtained at high doses which coincide with ataxia
and stereotyped behavior (>50 mg/kg, s.c.). in the case of
dizocilpine, these behavioral side-effects precluded testing
of doses higher than 0.125 mg/kg, i.p. although dizocilpine
was reported to be effective in the chronic constriction injury
model at a dose devoid of behavioral side-effects, antihyperalgesic properties only became apparent after repeated
administration (begon et al., 2000). boyce et al. (1999) were
able to demonstrate efficacy of this compound against
mechanical allodynia, but this occurred only at doses which
induced a performance dificit in a rotarod device. erichsen
and blackburn-munro (2002) also reported a lack of activity
of dizocilpine in the spared nerve injury model. together,
these findings suggest that the clinical utility of nonselective
n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists for the treatment
of neuropathic pain is compromised by their (very) small
therapeutic window. although it was argued that n-methyld-aspartate receptor nr2b-selective antagonists, such as
 xxxd2326xxx  (avenet et al., 1997) and ro 25-6981 (mutel et
al., 1998) would be able to overcome the drawback of a
small therapeutic window (for discussion, see boyce et al.,
1999), the present study failed to demonstrate clear efficacy
of these compounds. this finding contrasts with the study of
boyce et al. (1999), in which both compounds were reported
to have pronounced efficacy against mechanical allodynia in
the chronic constriction injury model. the present lack of

fig. 8. effect of the n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor nr2b-selective antagonists  xxxd2326xxx  (i.p., t = 30 min, n = 11 – 12 per group) and ro 25-6981 (i.p., t = 30
min, n = 12 per group) on thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia after chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. doses are expressed in mg/kg and
are indicated in brackets. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 versus vehicle-treated ligated group; ###p < 0.001 versus vehicle-treated sham-operated group.

efficacy can most likely not be ascribed to inappropriate
dose selection as the same dose range and route of application was used as in the boyce et al. (1999) study, and
behavioral activity was demonstrated in an operant behavior
assay under exactly the same application conditions (de vry
and jentzsch, 2003). it therefore remains unclear whether nmethyl-d-aspartate receptor nr2b-selective antagonists are
valuable treatment alternatives.
somewhat surprisingly, the anti-inflammatory  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor rofecoxib (chan et al., 1999) was found
to have moderate activity against thermal hyperalgesia.
although anti-inflammatory agents have not been extensively studied in animal models of neuropathic pain (martin
and eisenach, 2001), it is generally assumed that they are
not effective against neuropathic pain. therefore, the antihyperalgesic effect may indicate that inflammatory processes contribute to the pathophysiology of the model (possibly
due to the presence of ligation material, lindenlaub and
sommer, 2000).
of particular interest is the finding that the cannabinoids
d9 -tetrahydrocannabinol and cp 55,940 showed pronounced antihyperalgesic and anti-allodynic properties.
other cannabinoids, such as (r)-4,5-dihydro-2-methyl-4(4morpholinylmethyl)-1-(1-naphthalenylcarbonyl)-6h-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij] quinolin-6-one (win 55,212-2) and 3-[2-cya-

no-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenoxy]phenyl-4,4,4-trifluoro-1butanesulfonate (bay 59-3074), were also reported to be
effective in this model (de vry et al., in press; herzberg et
al., 1997). the antihyperalgesic and anti-allodynic properties of these compounds appear to be relatively specific, and
can clearly be dissociated from their antinociceptive properties (for discussion, see de vry et al., 2004a, in press;
siegling et al., 2001). together, these findings indicate that
cannabinoids may offer new opportunities for the treatment
of neuropathic pain (for review, see pertwee, 2001).
finally, both the  xxxg79xxx  inhibitor abt-702
(kowaluk et al., 2000) and the  xxxg81xxx 
positive allosteric modulator t62 (li et al., 2002) were
found to have relatively weak efficacy against mechanical
allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, respectively. as
assessed in the spinal nerve ligation model, both compounds
were previously reported to have some efficacy against
mechanical allodynia (kowaluk et al., 2000; li et al.,
2002). however, due to their limited efficacy and their
relatively small therapeutic window (in the present study
effective doses of both compounds also induced sedation
and flat body posture), such compounds do not appear to
have advantages above currently available treatment.
in conclusion, the present study offered a relatively broad
pharmacological validation of the chronic constriction injury

148

model of neuropathic pain. further clinical research is needed
to clarify whether the differential profile of activity of these
compounds in the model is reflected by differential efficacy
against various clinical symptoms of neuropathic pain.
