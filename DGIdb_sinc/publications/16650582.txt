abstract
systemic administration of morphine induced a hyperalgesic response in the hot plate test, at an extremely low dose (1–10 lg/kg).
we have examined in vivo whether morphine, at an extremely low dose, induces acute central hypernociception following activation
of the opioid receptor-mediated plc/pkc inositol-lipid signaling pathway. the plc inhibitor u73122 and the pkc blocker, calphostin c, dose dependently prevented the thermal hypernociception induced by morphine. this eﬀect was also prevented by pretreatment with aodn against plcb3 at 2 nmol/mouse and pkcc at 2–3 nmol/mouse. low dose morphine hyperalgesia was dose
dependently reversed by selective nmda antagonist mk801 and ketamine. this study demonstrates the presence of a nociceptive
plcb3/pkcc/nmda pathway stimulated by low concentrations of morphine, through lor1 receptor, in mouse brain. this signaling pathway appears to play an opposing role in morphine analgesia. when mice were treated with a morphine analgesic dose
(7 mg/kg), the downregulation of plcb3 or pkcc at the same aodn doses used for the prevention of the hyperalgesic eﬀect
induced, respectively, a 46% and 67% potentiation in analgesic response. experimental and clinical studies suggest that opioid
may activate pronociceptive systems, leading to pain hypersensitivity and short-term tolerance, a phenomenon encountered in postoperative pain management by acute opioid administration. the clinical management of pain by morphine may be revisited in light
of the identiﬁcation of the signaling molecules of the hyperalgesic pathway.

1. introduction
a growing body of evidence suggests that lor opioid agonists induce not only analgesia, but may also
enhance sensitivity to pain. this paradoxical eﬀect has
been demonstrated both in clinical (guignard et al.,

2000, 2001; laulin et al., 2002; van elstraete et al.,
2005). morphine, at higher doses, induces analgesia.
the alkaloid, via opioid receptors and ptx sensitive
inhibitory g protein (gi), inhibits  xxxd1773xxx  (camp)
formation, ca2+ conductance and activates k+ conductance leading to hyperpolarization of a cell and exerting
an inhibitory eﬀect (nestler, 1992). otherwise, extremely
low doses of morphine (1–10 lg/kg) can elicit acute
hyperalgesia in animal models of pain, i.e., tail ﬂick,
freund’s adjuvant-induced arthritic rats (kayan et al.,

1971; kayser et al., 1987; crain and shen, 2001). a dual
eﬀect of opioids on camp formation was reported in
cell culture. a low concentration (109 m) of damgo,
a selective lor agonist, stimulated camp production,
while a higher concentration (107 m) of the agonist
inhibited camp production (rubovitch et al., 2003).
stimulatory eﬀect of a single administration of opioids
at very low doses in dorsal root ganglion isolated cells
has been demonstrated to be mediated by coupling of
opioid receptors to cholera toxin sensitive second excitatory messenger proteins (crain and shen, 1998). others
have reported in cultured cells stimulatory eﬀects for
opioid receptors, following coupling to gi proteins that
also mediate the better known inhibitory eﬀects. the
opioid-induced stimulatory eﬀect leads to activation of
plc in various cell types via ptx sensitive gi proteins
(smart et al., 1995; tsu et al., 1995; chan et al., 2000),
triggering the activation of the phosphoinositide-signaling cascade (smart and lambert, 1996). most importantly, opioid receptors have the ability to activate the
plcb isoenzymes via the bc subunit of gi protein (park
et al., 1993), suggesting a role for these isoenzymes in
morphine-induced hyperalgesia. in the phosphoinositide-signaling pathway, the activation of plcb results
in the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (pip2) followed by the generation of two important second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate
(insp3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (dag). the former
increases the release of ca2+ from intracellular stores
and the latter activates protein kinase cc (pkcc), one
of the major pkc isoforms (fig. 1). pkcc has been
identiﬁed in neurons of cns and strongly modulates
opioid-signaling eﬃcacy triggering the activation of
n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) glutamatergic receptors
and the recruitment of the glutamatergic nmda systems involved in pain stimulation (celerier et al., 1999,
2004; sanchez-perez and felipo, 2005).
in the present report, we determined the signaling
pathway involved in the brain mechanisms associated
with low dose morphine-induced hyperalgesia in mice.
in this regard, we used supraspinal administration of
activators, inhibitors and antisense phosphodiester oli-

295

gonucleotides (aodns) against the main signaling components of the nociceptive pathway in order to
determine which messenger molecules are responsible
for the change in nociceptive thermal threshold after
systemic morphine administration in mice.
2. materials and methods
2.1. animals
sexually mature male swiss webster mice (morini, s. polo
d’enza, italy), weighing 23–30 g, were used. the animals were
fed a standard laboratory diet and water ad libitum, kept at
23 ± 1 °c with a 12-h light/dark cycle and previously habituated to the laboratory according to abbott et al. (1986). all
experiments were carried out in accordance with the european
community council directive of november 24 1986 for the
care and use of laboratory animals.
2.2. drugs
the following drugs were used: (e)-7-benzylidenenaltrexone tartrate (bntx),  xxxd1793xxx -cys-tyr- xxxd1794xxx -orn-thr-penthr-nhh2 (ctop),  xxxd1742xxx , ketamine, morphine hcl,
mk-801, naloxone, naloxone methiodide, naltriben, naloxonazine and norbinaltorphimine hcl (nor-nbi) (sigma
chemicals, st. louis, mo, usa); calphostin c, 1-[6-[[17b-3methoxyestra-4,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]1h-pyrrole-2,
5-dione (u-73122) and 1-[6-[[17b-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]amino]hexyl]-1h-pyrrolidinedione (u-73343) (calbiochem, milan, italy). drugs were administered in a volume of
5 ll per mouse by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection,
and 10 ml/kg by subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. calphostin c,  xxxd1742xxx , u-73122 and u-73343 were dissolved in
0.5% dmso, whereas all other drugs were dissolved in isotonic (nacl 0.9%) saline solution immediately before use. doses
and administration schedules of substances applied in this
study were based on doses shown to be eﬀective in previous
reports. morphine was administered s.c. immediately prior
estimation of hot plate licking latency (glare and walsh,
1991). calphostin c was injected i.c.v. 60 min before morphine
administration (ghelardini et al., 2002); naltriben was administered i.c.v. 30 min prior morphine (rawls et al., 2005); u-73122,
u-73343, bntx (rady et al., 1994), ketamine (ji et al., 2004)
and mk-801 (lee et al., 2002) were administered i.c.v. 10 min
prior morphine; ctop (suh and tseng, 1990),  xxxd1742xxx  (suh
et al., 1996) and nor-nbi (janecka et al., 2005) were injected
i.c.v. immediately before morphine administration; naloxonazine was administered i.c.v. 24 h before morphine (simone
et al., 1986); naloxone (jinsmaa et al., 2005) and naloxone
methiodide (wu et al., 1997) were administered s.c., respectively,
10 and 30 min before morphine administration.
2.3. antisense oligodeoxynucleotides

fig. 1. plc/pkc inositol-lipid signaling pathway is represented in the
scheme.

phosphodiester oligonucleotides (odns) protected by terminal phosphorothioate double substitution (capped odns)
against possible exonuclease-mediated degradation were
obtained from tib molbiol (genoa, italy). the following
aodn was produced against plcb3: 5 0 -t*gg*tggtcatct

gggatg*t*a-3 0 where * indicates the phosphorothioate
residue. anti-plcb3 odn was designed from the sequence
2649 to 2669 of the gi: 31982121 ncbi sequence wiewer; this
sequence was searched through genbank and found to be
unique to its respective plcb3 isoenzyme and was based on
mouse sequence. the aodn against pkcc was the following:
5 0 -a*c*gaagtccgggttcaca*t*a-3 0 . anti-pkcc odn
was designed from the sequence 2359 to 2378 of the gi:
31982442 ncbi sequence wiewer; this sequence was searched
through genbank and found to be unique to its respective
pkcc isoenzyme and was based on mouse sequence. three
base pairs in the antisense sequence were reversed to obtain
the following mismatch sequence (modns): 5 0 -t*gg*tg
tgcatcgtggtag*t*a-3 0 and 5 0 -a*c*gagatcgcgg
ttacca*t*a-3 0 sequence, respectively, for plcb3 and
pkcc isoenzymes. the 17 and 20mer fully degenerated odns
(dodns), where each base was randomly g, or c, or a, or t,
were used as degenerate odn (dodn). antisense odns,
modns and dodns were preincubated at 37 °c for 30 min
with an artiﬁcial cationic lipid (13 lm dotap, sigma) and
i.c.v. injected to mice in a 5 ll ﬁnal volume of dotap according to a previously described method (haley and mccormick,
1957). the odns were supplied to mice by i.c.v. injection 72,
48 and 24 h prior morphine administration.
2.4.  xxxd1773xxx  determination
mice were subcutaneously administered with 1 lg/kg or
7 mg/kg morphine or saline and sacriﬁced 15 or 30 min after
morphine administration, at the time of the maximum thermal
hyperalgesic eﬀect according to behavioural studies. liquid
nitrogen frozen brain areas were obtained from mice and
homogenized in 1 m acetic acid (1:2 w/v). after incubation
in a 95 °c water bath for 15 min, brain tissue was centrifuged
at 1500g for 15 min. supernatant was homogenized in 5% trichloroacetic acid and centrifuged for 30 min at 3000g for
20 min at 4 °c. supernatant fraction was trichloroacetic acid
removed by extracting with three volumes of water saturated
 xxxd2052xxx , adjusted to ph 6.2 and submitted to radioimmunoassay for camp according to steiner (1974).
2.5. dag determination
mice were subcutaneously administered with 1 lg/kg morphine or saline and sacriﬁced 15 or 30 min after morphine
administration. the extraction of dag from mouse brain was
carried out according to the method of bligh and dyer (1959).
liquid nitrogen frozen areas from both cerebral hemispheres
of mouse brain were homogenized (1:10 w/v) with chloroform/
methanol solution (1:2 v/v). a reagents system (amersham biosciences, usa) was used, based on a radioenzymatic assay
employing diacylglycerol kinase quantitatively converting
dag to [32p]phosphatidic acid in the presence of [c-32p]atp.
[32p]phosphatidic acid was separated on amprep minicolumns
and quantiﬁed using liquid scintillation spectrometry.
2.6. hot plate test
the adopted method was previously described (o’callaghan and holtzman, 1975). mice were placed inside a
stainless steel container, which was set thermostatically at

52.5 ± 0.1 °c in a precision water bath from kw mechanical workshop, siena, italy. we used a lower temperature
in the hot plate test (52.5 °c instead of 54 °c) to reveal
potential, subtle alterations that may occur in basal thermal
nociception. reaction times (s) were measured with a stopwatch immediately before morphine or vehicle or saline
administration and 15, 30 and 45 min after; each treatment
was blind to the experimenter. the endpoint for the licking
response was the ﬁrst paw lick whether it was lick of the
front or rear paw. those mice scoring less than 12 and
more than 18 s in the pretest were rejected. all treatments
for a same experiment were performed on the same period
of time. all the experiments were performed at the same
hours (9–13 a.m.). mice were randomly assigned to each
group. dose–response experiments were done using independent groups.
2.7. controls
the mice which underwent the hot plate test were submitted to paw temperature measurement 24 h, 10 and 1 min
before estimation of hot plate latency. the temperature was
measured with an infrared thermometer (omega, stanford,
ct). at the conclusion of the experiments, the mice were anesthetized, their brains were excised and cut coronally to check
the visible path of i.c.v. injection. only data from mice in
which the injection was correctly located within ventricles were
considered.
2.8. motor coordination
groups of mice pretreated with all the used drugs or odns
at the highest doses used in the above experiments were submitted to rota-rod (vaught et al., 1985) and hole-board (ghelardini et al., 2002) behavioural tests.
2.9. western blot analysis
western blot analysis was performed as previously
described in detail (pan et al., 1995). in summary, membrane homogenates (1 lg/ll protein) from diﬀerent brain
regions of aodn, dodn, modn and vehicle pretreated
mice were solubilized in sds buﬀer and separated on 10%
polyacrylamide gels (1.5 mm). proteins were transferred to
nitrocellulose (1.5 h at 190 ma) and the membranes were
blocked in pbs containing 3% bsa for 1 h before addition
of primary antisera. sc403 (plcb3), sc-211 (pkcc) and sc5274 (b-tubulin) (santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz,
usa) were used as probes at 1:1000 dilution. the blotting
was visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system
(pierce biotechnology inc., rockford, il, usa) and quantiﬁed with the versa doc 1000 imaging system (bio-rad
laboratories, hercules, ca, usa). protein was determined
as lowry method (lowry et al., 1951) using bsa as standard. samples from the same brain region of aodn,
dodn, modn and vehicle treated mice were processed
simultaneously in the same gel. each experiment was repeated three times at the same protein concentration. the diﬀerences observed as density average values corresponding to
aodn and modn treated mice were expressed as a
percentage.

fig. 2. eﬀect of increasing morphine doses on the licking latency response in the hot plate test. the licking latency values were measured 15, 30 and
45 min after s.c. morphine administration (0.01–7000 lg/kg). the values reported in ﬁgure are at 15 min after morphine administration. vertical bars
represent sem and *a < 0.05 in comparison with saline treated value. the number reported on the top of bar graph represents the number of animals
used in each experiment.

2.10. statistical analysis
all experimental results were given as means ± sem. analysis of variance anova, followed by fisher’s protected least
signiﬁcant diﬀerence procedure for post hoc comparison, was
used to verify signiﬁcance between two means of behavioural
results. data were analyzed with the statview software for
the macintosh (1992). a signiﬁcance level (a) less than 0.05
was considered signiﬁcant.
2.11. data analysis
the percentage of maximum possible eﬀect (%mpe) was
calculated for each mouse at each dose and time point according to the following formula:
ðpostreatment latency  pretreatment latencyþ
%mpe ¼
 100;
ðcutoff latency  pretreatment latencyþ
where licking latency was measured in seconds and cutoﬀ
latency was selected at 30. the trapezoidal rule, without
extrapolation to inﬁnite time, was used to calculate area under
the %mpe versus time curves (aucs) for each individual
animal.

3. results
3.1. dose–response curve of morphine in hot plate test
morphine s.c. administered at diﬀerent doses
(0.01–7000 lg/kg) induced a bimodal response in the

hot plate test (fig. 2). the maximum hyperalgesic eﬀect
was reached at 1–10 lg/kg; this eﬀect appeared 15 min
after administration and persisted almost unchanged
up to 45 min and then diminished. doses ranging
between 30 and 300 lg/kg were devoid of any eﬀect
on mice nociceptive threshold, whereas, at a dose of
1–7 mg/kg, morphine induced analgesia. naloxone
administration completely reversed the hyperalgesic
eﬀect whereas naloxone methiodide administration
lacked to reverse the hyperalgesic eﬀect (table 1). the
lor antagonist ctop and lor1 selective antagonist
naloxonazine completely reversed the 1 lg/kg morphine
hyperalgesic eﬀect whereas the d1 antagonist bntx, the
d2 antagonist naltriben and the j antagonist nor-nbi
failed to reverse the hyperalgesic eﬀect (table 1). the
same treatments, when administered alone, did not
modify the licking latency of mice in comparison with
saline administered animals (data not shown).
3.2.  xxxd1773xxx  and dag determination
the administration of  xxxd1742xxx  at diﬀerent concentrations (0.03–0.06 lg/kg i.c.v.) did not modify the licking latency response in the morphine hyperalgesic dose
treated mice compared to  xxxd1742xxx  untreated mice (data
not shown). acute administration of morphine at analgesic dose (7 mg/kg) signiﬁcantly decreased camp levels
in diﬀerent mouse brain areas in comparison with saline

duced hyperalgesia in the hot plate test (fig. 4). the
reversal of the hyperalgesic eﬀect appeared 15 min after
administration, slightly decreased 30 min after and then
diminished. all the compounds used in pretreatments,
injected alone, produced neither a hyperalgesic nor an
analgesic eﬀect (figs. 3 and 4).
3.4. eﬀect of plcb3 and pkcc downregulation on
morphine-induced hyperalgesia
the thermal hypernociception induced by morphine
was prevented by pretreatment with the aodn against
plcb3, at 2 nmol/mouse (fig. 5). 1 nmol/mouse was
ineﬀective; 2 nmol/mouse prevented the morphine-induced hypernociception, whereas it mildly increased
the nociceptive threshold (fig. 5). higher doses of
plcb3 aodn could not be administered because this
was lethal. pretreatment with aodn against the
pkcc isoform (0.5–3 nmol/mouse) prevented the
hyperalgesia induced by low dose morphine (1 lg/kg)
in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 6). lower aodn
doses (0.5–1 nmol/mouse) were ineﬀective in modifying
the hyperalgesic eﬀect whereas higher doses (2–3 nmol/
mouse) prevented the hyperalgesic response revealing a
mild analgesic eﬀect. mismatch odns and dodns

against both isoenzymes, when used at the higher doses
in presence or absence of morphine hyperalgesic dose,
did not signiﬁcantly modify the nociceptive threshold
in hot plate test with respect to morphine or vehicle
administered animals (figs. 5 and 6). the area under
curves of average percent maximum possible eﬀect
(%mpe) versus time for morphine in aodn treated
mice, linearly increased with respect to plcb3 and
pkcc aodn doses (fig. 7). the prevention of morphine hyperalgesia produced by aodns against plcb3
and pkcc at highest active doses disappeared 7 days
after the end of the aodn pretreatment (data not
shown).
3.5. immunoblotting
immunoblotting revealed a signiﬁcant decrease of
plcb3, pkcc expression, respectively, in diﬀerent brain
areas from mice previously treated with corresponding
aodns with respect to modn treated mice (fig. 8;
table 3). immunoblot was re-probed for a non-regulatory protein, b-tubulin, and no signiﬁcant density diﬀerence was revealed for this protein between samples from
the plcb3 and pkcc downregulated brain regions
(data not shown).
3.6. eﬀect of nmda receptor antagonists on
hyperalgesia
the administration of site-speciﬁc nmda receptor
antagonist mk801 and ketamine to mice completely
reversed the hyperalgesic eﬀect induced by 1 lg/kg morphine (fig. 9). pretreatment with mk801 at 0.005–
0.3 lg/mouse produced a dose-dependent inhibition
of 1 lg/kg morphine-induced hyperalgesia in the hot
plate test (fig. 9a). at the highest mk801 dose, the
reversion of the hyperalgesic eﬀect appeared 15 min
after administration, slightly decreased 30 min after
and then diminished. pretreatment with ketamine at
0.05–0.5 lg/mouse produced a dose-dependent inhibition of 1 lg/kg morphine-induced hyperalgesia in the
hot plate test (fig. 9b). at the highest ketamine dose,

the reversion of the hyperalgesic eﬀect appeared 15 min
after administration, almost unchanged 30 min after and
then diminished. all the compounds used in pretreatments, injected alone, produced neither a hyperalgesic
nor an analgesic eﬀect (data not shown).
3.7. eﬀect of plcb3 and pkcc downregulation on
morphine-induced analgesia
in plcb3 pretreated mice the analgesic eﬀect induced
by 7 mg/kg morphine dose was signiﬁcantly potentiated
at 15 and 30 min after morphine administration
(fig. 10). in pkcc pretreated mice, the potentiation of
the analgesic eﬀect induced by 7 mg/kg morphine dose

started at 30 min and was prolonged until 45 min after
morphine administration. when an analgesic morphine
dose (7 mg/kg) was administered to mice pretreated with
aodns against plcb3 and pkcc at the eﬀective doses,
a 46% and 67% increase in the analgesic response,
respectively, was induced in comparison with aodn
untreated animals, as shown by area under average percent maximum possible eﬀect (%mpe) versus time
course (auc) (fig. 11).
3.8. eﬀect of treatments on mouse behavior
the endurance time on the rotating rod, evaluated
before and 15, 30 and 45 min after 1 lg/kg morphine
administration, indicated a lack of any impairment in
the motor coordination of animals pretreated with drugs
and odns at the same time administration and doses
(data not shown). the spontaneous motility as well as
the inspection activity of mice, expressed as counts in
10 min, was unmodiﬁed by the above-mentioned compounds in comparison with the corresponding control
group (data not shown). the skin temperature of the
mice paws remained unchanged after administration of
the diﬀerent pretreatments (data not shown) showing
that these compounds do not induce any signiﬁcant
change in basal temperature.

the present study conﬁrms that low dose morphine
systemic administration induced hyperalgesia in normal
mice submitted to a condition of acute thermal nociception. the hyperalgesic eﬀect was reached at 1–10 lg/kg
subcutaneous morphine administration, as demonstrated by the signiﬁcant decrease in nociceptive threshold.
this eﬀect was completely reversed by the administration of naloxone. the cns origin of low dose morphine
hyperalgesia was shown because the hyperalgesia was
completely blocked by naloxone, which crosses bbb,
and not by naloxone methiodide, administered at a dose
which blocks the peripheral eﬀects of morphine in
rodents but does not cross the bbb. the eﬀect of naloxone was reproduced using the selective lor antagonist
ctop and lor1 antagonist naloxonazine but not the
d-opioid receptor antagonists naltriben and bntx, or
the j-opioid receptor antagonist nor-nbi administered
at eﬀective doses. these data demonstrate that the
hyperalgesic eﬀect is mediated by a speciﬁc opiate receptor subtype, i.e., lor1.
 xxxd1773xxx  levels measured at the time of the maximum hyperalgesic eﬀect in mice previously administered with 1 lg/kg morphine dose did not signiﬁcantly
change with respect to control mice whereas, as expected, camp values signiﬁcantly decreased in mice administered with morphine at the analgesic dose.
administration of  xxxd1742xxx , an adenylate cyclase activator, at a dose which increases camp level in rodents, did
not signiﬁcantly modify the hyperalgesic eﬀect. these

data did not suggest that stimulatory eﬀect induced by
morphine low dose administration in vivo was due to
camp stimulation.
in our experiments, the administration of the nonselective isoform plc inhibitor u73122 to mice dose
dependently prevented the hyperalgesia induced by low
dose morphine exposure. by contrast u73343, a succinimido analog used as negative control for u73122 and a
weak plc inhibitor failed to reverse the hyperalgesia.
thus, morphine-induced hyperalgesia appeared to be
mediated by plc activation. among the plcb isoforms, the downregulation of plcb3 isoenzyme in
mouse brain by anti-plcb3 aodn pretreatment
induced a reversion of low dose morphine stimulated
hyperalgesic eﬀect, which was mildly antinociceptive at
the highest anti-plcb3 aodn dose. control experiments excluded toxicity and hybridization-dependent
artefacts. considering that plc stimulates pkc in
plc/pkc inositol-lipid signaling pathway, the activation of pkc was also investigated. this hypothesis
was supported by the increase in value of dag, a product of plcb, obtained in diﬀerent brain regions of mice
administered with morphine hyperalgesic dose with
respect to saline administered mice. pretreatment with
calphostin c, a selective pkc inhibitor, dose dependently prevented the hyperalgesia induced by morphine.
these ﬁndings suggest that activation of pkc constitutes a signiﬁcant step in morphine-induced hyperalgesia. in particular, pkcc appears to participate in
increased pain sensitivity (malmberg et al., 1997; martin
et al., 2001; celerier et al., 2004). we further demonstrated that the downregulation of pkcc in mouse brain
by anti-pkcc aodn pretreatment induced a reversal of
morphine hyperalgesic eﬀect in mice and, at the same
time, a mild analgesic eﬀect. control experiments
excluded toxicity and hybridization-dependent artefacts.
furthermore, lor stimulation triggers the activation
of nmda receptors by increasing intracellular pkc

activity (chen and huang, 1991) as well as translocation
of the cytosolic pkcc to the plasma membrane leading
to phosphorylation of the nmda receptors implicated
in pain promotion (suen et al., 1998). evidence for
nmda receptor activation during the hyperalgesic
response to low dose morphine administration was
recently demonstrated (holtman and wala, 2005). in
our behavioural test, low dose morphine-induced hyperalgesia was prevented by nmda high aﬃnity, non-competitive antagonist mk801 and ketamine. this eﬀect was
dose dependent. pkcc associates physically with
nmda nr1 subunit in the postsynaptic density in rat
brain, suggesting that these receptors may be directly
phosphorylated by the kinase, leading to enhancement
of synaptic activity (suen et al., 1998). the majority of
nmda nr1 labeled dendrites contained lor labeling
in ventrolateral pag (commons et al., 1999), a supraspinal brainstem region of interest because of its established
role in modulation of nociceptive transmission. this area
was found pkcc and plcb3 positive in our immunoblotting experiments. cortex electrical stimulation produced signiﬁcant decrease in tail ﬂick latency
(calejesan et al., 2000), suggesting that cortical areas
support the descending facilitatory modulation of nociceptive response. nmda receptors in anterior cingulated cortex are involved in descending facilitation
through a relay in the rostral ventromedial medulla
(rvm) (calejesan et al., 2000; zhang et al., 2005). the
hippocampal formation, a high density lor area, has
been involved in aﬀective-motivational response to noxious-aversive events. microinjection of a glutamate
receptor antagonist into the dorsal hippocampal formation of the rat attenuated the nociceptive behavior to the
unconditioned hind paw injection of the algogen formalin (mckenna and melzack, 2001). both plcb3 and
pkcc could be detected by immunoblotting in cortical
and hippocampal areas. otherwise, plcb3 was not
revealed by our immunoblotting in striatum. therefore,

n. galeotti et al. / pain 123 (2006) 294–305

we surmise that this area is not implicated in circuits for
low dose morphine-induced hyperalgesia. pkcc was
expressed in very few of the lor positive cells in the
spinal cord in absence of stimulus, suggesting that this
isoform does not underlie the interaction between lor
and nmda receptors at spinal level (zeitz et al.,
2001). otherwise, pkcc immunoreactivity increased in
spinal cord after chronic morphine administration and
was prevented by nmda antagonist administration
(mao et al., 1995).
pronociceptive actions are promoted by the pag/
rvm circuit (basbaum and fields, 1984), classically
involved in antinociception, depending on the intensity
of the triggering stimulus (lima and almeida, 2002).
facilitation of the nociceptive response capacity mediated by rvm, a brainstem area receiving projections
from pag, is triggered by much less intense local chemical or electrical stimulation than that resulting on inhibition (zhuo and gebhart, 1997). we surmise that the
pag/rvm circuit acts at supraspinal level, inducing
hyperalgesia through the nociceptive plcb3/pkcc/
nmda pathway stimulated by low doses of morphine,
through lor1 receptor, in mouse brain. otherwise, a
diﬀerent molecular pathway of bimodal excitatory/inhibitory action induced by opioid agonists on dorsal
root ganglionic sensory neurons was proved, suggesting
that diﬀerent types of mechanism act depending on nervous system areas. strong evidence indicates that opioid
receptor can be interconverted rapidly between inhibitory gi/o coupled and excitatory (gs coupled) mode, following physiological alterations in the concentration of
camp/pka-dependent glycolipid gm1 ganglioside in
neuronal sensory cell membranes (crain and shen,
1998, 2000, 2004).
the plcb3/pkcc pronociceptive-signaling pathway
appears to play an opposing role in morphine analgesia.
when mice were treated with a morphine analgesic dose
(7 mg/kg), the downregulation of plcb3 or pkcc at the
same aodn doses used for the prevention of the hyperalgesic eﬀect induced a potentiation in analgesic
response. the magnitude of diﬀerence in morphineinduced analgesia was dramatically greater in plcb3/
pkcc downregulated mice (auc 46% and 67%, respectively, greater in aodn treated compared with untreated mice). the potentiation of the analgesic eﬀect was
observable at the earlier time and, in pkcc downregulated mice, lasted longer. these results suggest that
increased morphine-induced analgesia observed in the
plcb3 or pkcc aodn treated mice does not result
from a true potentiating eﬀect of plcb3 or pkcc downregulation, rather to the blockade of the pain facilitatory
system activated by these enzymes.
dual eﬀects have been encountered in postoperative
pain management by opioids. hyperalgesia and allodynia have been observed in human volunteers after
opiod analgesia (guignard et al., 2000; angst et al.,

303

2003; compton et al., 2003). this paradoxical eﬀect
was usually ascribed to progressive reduction of opioid
eﬀects, occurring over a period of weeks, with repeated
drug administration (tolerance) or following a single
opiate administration (short-term tolerance). hyperalgesia is apparent both immediately after administration
of a low (1–10 lg/kg) dose of morphine to mice or, at a
later time, after analgesic morphine dose administration when the opiate concentration is expected to be
as low as morphine brain concentration after low dose
administration (glare and walsh, 1991). the hyperalgesic eﬀect has typically been observed as a delayed
response seen subsequent to the analgesic response produced by central or systemic administration of opioid
agonists (celerier et al., 2000; mao, 2002; richebe
et al., 2005). therefore, tolerance – especially shortterm tolerance – may be not mainly due to a decrease
in opioid eﬀectiveness, as conventionally described, but
might result from the expression of nociceptive facilitatory systems which, at later times after morphine analgesic dose administration, are not overwhelmed by the
opponent antinociceptive inhibitory systems. the conventional practice of opioid therapy in presence of
diminishing analgesic eﬃcacy in the perioperative setting is based on a dose escalation to restore analgesic
eﬀects, assuming the development of opioid short-term
tolerance. otherwise, morphine decreased eﬃcacy may
be ascribed to paradoxical opioid-induced pain sensitivity. we surmise that the clinical management of pain
by morphine can be revisited in light of the identiﬁcation of the signaling molecules of the hyperalgesic
pathway. new strategies are needed to reduce opioidinduced pain sensitivity such as a combined use of
morphine and clinically available inhibitors of the
pronociceptive system.
