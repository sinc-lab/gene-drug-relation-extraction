abstract
because long-term administration of antipsychotics can cause behavioral dopamine supersensitivity, this study examined whether the antipsychotic  xxxd3195xxx  could elicit biochemical changes indicative of dopamine supersensitivity. in rats,
behavioral dopamine supersensitivity is consistently associated with an increased proportion of dopamine receptors that have high afﬁnity for dopamine, namely d2high, in
homogenized striata. nine days of subcutaneously injected  xxxd3195xxx  (1.25 mg/kg/day)
increased the proportion of d2high receptors between 186% and 215%, although the
total population of d2 receptors did not change. although the ﬁndings suggest that
rats or patients treated with  xxxd3195xxx  might exhibit behavioral dopamine supersensitivity, the drug-induced increase in d2high receptors was less than that previously
found with haloperidol. synapse 62:389–393, 2008. v 2008 wiley-liss, inc.

introduction
 xxxd3195xxx  is an antipsychotic with a distinct pharmacological proﬁle. although it is a potent antagonist
of the  xxxg656xxx  with an inhibition constant (ki) of 1.9 nm (sánchez et al., 1991; seeman,
2006), it does not elicit parkinsonism (zimbroff et al.,
1997). because long-term administration of antipsychotics can cause behavioral dopamine supersensitivity (arnt, 1998; muller and seeman, 1978), and possibly even supersensitivity psychosis (chouinard and
jones, 1980; lambert, 2007), the present study was
done to determine whether  xxxd3195xxx  could also
induce biochemical changes that might indicate dopamine supersensitivity.
although the molecular basis of dopamine supersensitivity is not known (seeman et al., 2006), continuous treatment with antipsychotics in animals induces a modest elevation of 20–40% in dopamine d2
receptors (seeman, 1980). furthermore, dopamine
supersensitivity in animals is consistently associated
with a marked elevation in the fraction of dopamine
d2 receptors in the brain striatum that are in the
high-afﬁnity state for dopamine, d2high (seeman
et al., 2005a, 2006, 2007a,b).
while dopamine d2 receptors can exist in either a
state of high afﬁnity for dopamine, d2high, or in a
state of low afﬁnity for dopamine, d2low (sibley
et al., 1982), the functional state is considered to be
d2high. this interpretation rests on the observation
c 2008

that the therapeutic concentrations of dopamine
agonists that suppress the release of prolactin are
the same as those that act at d2high (george et al.,
1985; mcdonald et al., 1984). moreover, the therapeutic clinical concentrations of anti-parkinson d2
agonists such as pramipexole, apomorphine, or naxagolide are the same as those that stimulate the
d2high receptor (seeman, 2007b; seeman et al.,
2005b).
hitherto, the detection of d2high and d2low has
been done by dopamine competition with [3h]spiperone (sibley et al., 1982). however, when competing
dopamine versus [3h]spiperone, there is no distinct
demarcation between the high-afﬁnity and low-afﬁnity phases for dopamine (seeman et al., 2006), and
computer-assisted analysis is needed. these two
phases of dopamine competition are more easily detectable and sharply demarcated when [3h]dom-

peridone is used to label the d2 receptors (seeman
et al., 2003). in fact, it has long been observed that
dopamine inhibits the binding of [3h] xxxd1927xxx  to
d2 receptors in two phases, one at low concentrations
of dopamine, and a second phase at high concentrations of dopamine (baudry et al., 1979; grigoriadis
and seeman, 1986; lazareno, 1983; martres et al.,
1984; sokoloff et al., 1984).
in addition to using [3h] xxxd1927xxx , we also used
the agonist [3h](1)phno (samaha et al., 2007a,b) to
detect antipsychotic-induced changes in d2high dopamine receptors caused by the long-term administration of  xxxd3195xxx .
materials and methods
treatment of rats with drugs
sprague-dawley rats (250 g) were subcutaneously
injected with  xxxd3195xxx  base [generously donated by
h. lundbeck a/s (copenhagen); in 1% tween 20 in
water; 1.25 mg/kg/day] for 9 days. forty-eight hours
after the last injection, the rats were euthanized by
co2.
preparation of rat striata
after co2 euthanasia, the brains were immediately removed, and the striata dissected and frozen
at 2808c until use. the striata were homogenized
in buffer [4 mg frozen striatum/ml buffer consisting
of 50 mm tris-hc1 (ph 7.4 at 208c), 1 mm edta,
5 mm kcl, 1.5 mm cacl2, 4 mm mgc12; 120 mm
nacl], using a teﬂon-glass homogenizer, with the
piston rotating at 500 rpm, and 10 up and down
strokes of the glass container. the homogenate was
not washed, because it is known that some of the d2
receptors can be lost by this procedure (seeman
et al., 1984). the 48-h period after the last  xxxd3195xxx  injection was considered sufﬁcient to render the
residual amount of brain  xxxd3195xxx  to negligible
levels.
[3h] xxxd1927xxx  was custom-synthesized as [phenyl-3h(n)] xxxd1927xxx  (42–68 ci/mmol) by perkinelmer life sciences (boston, ma), and used at a
ﬁnal concentration of 2 nm. the dissociation constant,
kd, for [3h] xxxd1927xxx  is 0.47 nm at d2 for rat
striatum (seeman et al., 2003).
two methods for measuring d2high
dopamine receptors
two independent methods were used to measure
dopamine d2high receptors.
competition method: the proportion of d2high
receptors in the striata was measured by the competition of dopamine with [3h] xxxd1927xxx , as previously described (seeman et al., 2003). brieﬂy, the
competition between dopamine and [3h]domsynapse

peridone for binding to dopamine d2 receptors was
done as follows. each incubation tube (12 mm 3 75
mm, glass) received, in the following order, 0.5 ml
buffer (containing dopamine at various concentrations,
and with or without a ﬁnal concentration of 10 lm ssulpiride to deﬁne nonspeciﬁc binding to the dopamine
d2 receptors), 0.25 ml [3h] xxxd1927xxx , and 0.25 ml of
the striatal homogenate. the tubes, containing a total
volume of 1 ml, were incubated for 2 h at room temperature (208c), after which the incubates were ﬁltered, using a 12-well cell harvester (titertek, skatron,
lier, norway) and buffer-presoaked glass ﬁber ﬁlter
mats (whatman gf/c). after ﬁltering the incubate,
the ﬁlter mat was rinsed with buffer for 15 s (7.5 ml
buffer). the ﬁlters were pushed out and placed in scintillation polystyrene minivials (7 ml, 16 mm 3 54 mm;
valley container, bridgeport, conn.). the minivials
received 4 ml each of scintillant (research products
international corp., mount prospect, il), and were
monitored 6 h later for tritium in a beckman
ls5000ta scintillation spectrometer at 55% efﬁciency.
the speciﬁc binding of [3h] xxxd1927xxx  was deﬁned as
total binding minus that in the presence of 10 lm ssulpiride.
the cheng–prusoff equation (cheng and prusoff,
1973) was used to derive the dissociation constant (ki
value) of dopamine from the concentration that inhibited 50% of the high-afﬁnity component (ic50) or 50%
of the low-afﬁnity component in the dopamine/
[3h] xxxd1927xxx  competition curve. the form of the
cheng–prusoff equation used was ki 5 ic50/(1 1 c/
kd), where c was the ﬁnal concentration of the ligand
and kd was the dissociation constant of [3h] xxxd1927xxx , as determined directly by independent
experiments of saturation binding to the tissue (i.e.,
scatchard plot).
[3h](1)phno and guanine nucleotide method: a
second method to measure the number of d2high
receptors was to use [3h]phno with and without
guanine nucleotide (seeman et al., 1993). [3h](1)
phno (also known as naxagolide or mk 458, or (1)4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine) is chemically deﬁned as (1)-4-propyl-3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-2hnaphtho[1,2-b][1,4]oxazin-9-ol. to prepare [3h](1)
phno, the allyl precursor of (1)-phno was tritiated
and puriﬁed by perkinelmer life sciences to a speciﬁc activity of 78 ci/mmol.
as later shown in the results, a range of
[3h]phno concentrations (0.1–5 nm) in the presence
and absence of 200 lm guanilylimidodiphosphate
(gn) were used to saturate the d2 receptors. the gn
served to convert the d2high receptors into d2low
receptors. the difference caused by gn in the amount
of [3h]phno bound was the number of d2high receptors in the tissue. after incubation of the test tubes,
the subsequent procedure was identical to that for
the competition method, mentioned earlier.

nonspeciﬁc binding of 2 nm [3h] xxxd1927xxx  was deﬁned by the
presence of 10 lm s-sulpiride.

in order to examine changes in d2high by a separate and independent method, the binding of
[3h](1)phno was measured in the presence and absence of 200 lm gn, the difference of which measured the density of gn-sensitive receptors that were
in the high-afﬁnity state for dopamine.
in the present study, the control value of gn-sensitive d2high receptors was 3.87 6 0.7 pmol/g (mean 6
se; n 5 12), in agreement with the value of 3.86 6
0.3 pmol/g (mean 6 se; n 5 11) for previously examined striata in this laboratory. a typical result is
shown in figure 3.
the long-term administration of  xxxd3195xxx  increased the proportion of d2high receptors to 12.2 6
0.8 pmol/g (mean 6 se; n 5 12), an increase of 215%,
as shown in figure 2 (right panel).
discussion

results
results using the dopamine/[3h] xxxd1927xxx 
competition method
dopamine inhibited the binding of [3h] xxxd1927xxx 
in two phases, as shown for the single representative
experiment in figure 1. at low concentrations, corresponding to the high-afﬁnity state of the dopamine
 xxxg656xxx , d2high, dopamine inhibited the binding
of [3h] xxxd1927xxx  at concentrations below 100 nm
dopamine. a second phase of inhibition occurred at
dopamine concentrations above 5000 nm dopamine.
the demarcation between the two phases was unambiguous, clearly and readily permitting the measurement of the d2high component as a percent of the
total amount of speciﬁc [3h] xxxd1927xxx  binding, as
deﬁned by the presence of 10 lm s-sulpiride.
in the present study, the control value for d2high
was 17.5% 6 0.5% (mean 6 se; n 5 12 rats), as
shown in figure 2 (middle panel). this is in agreement with the value of 19.9% 6 0.9% (n 5 29) for
other control rats tested previously in this laboratory.
however, after 9 days of  xxxd3195xxx  administration,
the d2high proportion was 50% 6 4.8% (mean 6 se;
n 5 6 rats), using the competition method, an
increase of 186% above the control value, as illustrated in figure 1 for one typical striatum, and in
figure 2 (middle panel) for all the treated striata.
it is important to note that the population of d2
receptors, reﬂected by the total speciﬁc binding of
2 nm [3h] xxxd1927xxx , did not increase in the drugtreated striatal homogenates. in fact, there was a

the results indicate that 9 days of subcutaneous
injections of  xxxd3195xxx  moderately increased the proportion of dopamine d2high receptors by 186%, using
[3h] xxxd1927xxx , or by 215%, using the gn-sensitive
component of [3h](1)phno binding. the two methods used in this study agreed qualitatively and quantitatively.
although it is also possible that  xxxd3195xxx  may
elicit behavioral dopamine supersensitivity in treated
humans, the presence of daily continued medication
would continue to block the d2 receptors and protect
the treated individual from exhibiting such behavioral
supersensitivity.
using the [3h] xxxd1927xxx  method, the control
value of 17.5% for the proportion of d2high receptors
approximately agrees with the value of 20.9%
obtained by comparing the d2 densities obtained by
[3h](1)phno and [3h]raclopride. for example, the
density of d2 receptors that are labeled by [3h]phno
and converted by guanine nucleotide was 3.86 pmol/g,
while the total d2 population measured by
[3h]raclopride is known to be 18.4 6 0.5 (mean 6 se;
n 5 53) pmol/g; the proportion of d2high, as measured
by this comparison, therefore, is 20.9%.
it is important to note that  xxxd3195xxx  did not alter
the total density of dopamine d2 receptors. this is in
contrast to many other antipsychotics that are well
known to increase the density of d2 receptors, including typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol or the
phenothiazines, and atypical antipsychotics such as
olanzapine or risperidone (seeman, 1980, 2006). this
lack of d2 elevation by  xxxd3195xxx  may well be helpful

dopamine d2high receptors elevated by  xxxd3195xxx 

in minimizing any possible long-term side effects of
the compound.
because the total density of the d2 receptors did
not change, the increase in the proportion of d2high
receptors must have come about by a conversion of
low-afﬁnity receptors into high-afﬁnity receptors, the
molecular mechanisms of which are discussed elsewhere (seeman et al., 2006, 2007b).
it is essential to compare the present data with
those obtained with long-term haloperidol (samaha
et al., 2007a,b). the continuous subcutaneous infusion of haloperidol at 0.75 mg/kg/day by osmotic
pump led to an increase of 137–188% in striatal
d2high sites, using the [3h] xxxd1927xxx  method
(samaha et al., 2007a). moreover, haloperidol infusion at 0.05 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day by an osmotic pump led to increases of 185% and 430% in
d2high, respectively, as measured by the increase in
the gn-sensitive component of d2high receptors
(samaha et al., 2007b). the haloperidol infusion rate
of 0.5 mg/kg/day corresponds to clinical d2 occupancy
(kapur et al., 2003) that matches the 24-h exposure
of striatal d2 receptors by  xxxd3195xxx  (hyttel et al.,
1992; sánchez et al., 1991). in comparison, therefore,
the d2high receptor induction of 430% by haloperidol
is considerably higher than the 215% elicited by  xxxd3195xxx . correspondingly, therefore, given that there
is a relation between d2high and behavioral dopamine supersensitivity, it appears that  xxxd3195xxx 
would elicit less clinical dopamine supersensitivity
than haloperidol.
