abstract
acidification of the bone surface, leading to bone resorption, is accomplished by a vacuolar-type h1-atpase
present in a specialized domain of the plasma membrane of the osteoclast known as the ruffled membrane.
structure and function appears to be highly conserved within this class of multisubunit enzymes. however, cloning
and sequencing of complementary dna has shown that one of the subunits in the catalytic domain, the b-subunit,
exists in at least two forms, b1 and b2. b1 messenger rna has been found almost exclusively in the kidney,
whereas messenger rna for b2 has been found in all tissues studied, including the kidney. it has been speculated
that the b1 isoform might be involved in targeting to the plasma membrane. in the present study, we have
characterized the b-subunit of the chicken osteoclast h1-atpase using antibodies directed against peptides with
isoform-specific or conserved sequences of the b-subunit. western analysis was performed on chicken osteoclast
membrane vesicles and on partially purified chicken osteoclast h1-atpase and was compared with similar
analysis of h1-atpase isolated from bovine kidney and brain. the b1-specific antibody reacted with a polypeptide
of approximately 56 kd on immunoblots of the renal h1-atpase, whereas no reaction could be detected against
the osteoclast h1-atpase or the osteoclast membrane vesicle preparation. in contrast, the antibody against a
b2-specific sequence reacted with a peptide of approximately 56 kd on immunoblots of the osteoclast h1-atpase,
the renal h1-atpase, and the clathrin-coated vesicle h1-atpase. the antibody against a conserved region of the
b-subunit did not generate any evidence for the presence of isoforms other than b2 in the osteoclast. immunocytochemistry of rat osteoclasts on bovine bone slices using the b2 antibody showed intense polarized staining
along the plasma membrane facing the bone surface in actively resorbing osteoclasts whereas nonresorbing
osteoclasts were diffusely stained throughout the cytoplasm. by confocal microscopy, the b2 staining was located
to the level of the ruffled membrane and appeared to be concentrated to the peripheral areas of the membrane
adjacent to the sealing zone. we conclude that the osteoclast vacuolar h1-atpase contains the b2 isoform and
suggest that upon initiation of resorption the pump is translocated from the cell interior to a special domain of the
ruffled membrane close to the sealing zone. (j bone miner res 1997;12:753–760)

introduction
uring bone resorption, the osteoclast is polarized toward the bone surface with a highly folded plasma
membrane region, the ruffled membrane, facing the bone
surface.(1) the ruffled membrane, the bone attachment

d

zones, and the bone form an enclosed compartment that is
acidified by the osteoclast. this acidification leads to dissolution of the inorganic component of the bone (mainly
hydroxylapatite) and to stimulation of proteolytic enzymes
which digest the organic component (mainly collagen).(2)
there is evidence that a  xxxg215xxx  is inserted into the

ruffled membrane of the osteoclast and is responsible for
the acidification of the resorption lacuna.(3,5) immunological and functional evidence suggests that this  xxxg215xxx 
belongs to the family of vacuolar h1-atpases.(3–10)
vacuolar h1-atpases are present in essentially all eukaryotic cells where their electrogenic proton transport energizes intracellular organelles including clathrin-coated
vesicles, lysosomes, and chromaffin granules.(11) apart
from the osteoclast, vacuolar h1-atpases have also been
found in the plasma membranes of other mammalian cells
such as the renal intercalated cell and the macrophage
where they are involved in the acidification of the urine and
the regulation of intracellular ph, respectively.(12,13)
the overall structure of all purified vacuolar h1atpases is similar. the principal composition of the enzyme is a catalytic cytoplasmic domain (vc) including 70 kd
(a), 58 kd (b), 40 kd, and 33 kd subunits,(14) and a  xxxd279xxx -sensitive transmembranous proton channel (vb) consisting of 116, 39, and 17 kd subunits.(15) recently, we
partially purified the  xxxg215xxx  present in a membrane
vesicle preparation from osteoclasts and showed that this
enzyme is structurally and immunologically similar to the
brain clathrin-coated vesicle h1-atpase.(9) thus, despite
the fact that vacuolar h1-atpases are involved in a variety
of cellular functions, the overall structure is highly conserved. however, recent cloning and characterization of
cdna has suggested that isoforms exist of some of these
subunits. in particular, there is evidence that the b-subunit
exists in at least two forms, b1 and b2.(16 –18) the cdnas
for these b-subunits have been isolated from brain and
kidney cdna libraries, both from human and bovine tissues.(16 –18) comparison of these sequences of the b-subunit
shows 80 –90% homology at the amino acid level, with
greatest variations at the n- and c-terminal regions. northern blot analysis of human and bovine tissues has shown
that the kidney has high levels of b1 messenger rna
expression and the message is not found in any other tissue
except for the placenta and the lung where only moderate
or low levels, respectively, of expression can be detected.(18 –20) in contrast, b2 messenger rna is found at almost
equal levels of expression in most tissues, including the
kidney.(18 –20) there is not yet any evidence that the isoform
variability has any functional significance. however, vacuolar h1-atpases isolated from different regions of the kidney have been shown to have variations in the composition
of peptides in the 56 kd region and to differ in some
functional properties, including ph optimum and sensitivity
to cations.(21) it has been suggested that the b1 isoform
might contain information important for plasma membrane
targeting.(18)
the purpose of the present study was to characterize the
b-subunit of the h1-atpase responsible for osteoclast
bone resorption. we have prepared antibodies against peptides with sequences from conserved or isoform-specific
regions of the b-subunit and tested their reactivity against
isolated osteoclast membranes and the partially purified
h1-atpase. these reactions were compared with those
obtained with partially purified h1-atpases from brain
and kidney. finally, the localization of reactive antigen in
the osteoclast was investigated using immunocytochemistry.

materials and methods
materials
acridine orange was obtained from kodak (rochester,
ny, u.s.a.); phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine,
phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylserine from avanti polar lipids (birmingham, al, u.s.a.);  xxxd1685xxx  was obtained
from calbiochem corp. (lajolla, ca, u.s.a.).  xxxd279xxx 
a1, isolated from streptomyces sp., was purified by astra hässle ab, (mölndal, sweden). the partially purified clathrincoated vesicle h1-atpase(22) was generous gift from prof.
dennis stone (department of internal medicine, university
of texas southwestern medical center, dallas, tx, u.s.a.).
a 12-amino acid peptide, stlsefyprdsa (corresponding to a 12 amino acid sequence at the c-terminal of the
b2-isoform, fig. 1), was obtained from auspep (parkville,
australia), dissolved in sterile distilled water and stored at
2208c. all other chemicals were obtained from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo, u.s.a.).

generation of antibodies
the generation of antibodies against peptides corresponding to conserved or isoform-specific regions of the
b-subunit from bovine tissues (sequences from refs. 17
and 18, displayed in fig. 1) was performed by symbicom
(umeå, sweden) using the method described by löwenadler et al.(23) in brief, oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding
to isoform-specific or conserved regions of the b-subunit
were synthesized and cloned into a fusion vector, pezz18,
containing two synthetic igg-binding domains of staphylococcus aureus protein a. escherichia coli was transformed
with the vector and the soluble fusion product recovered
from the medium by igg affinity chromatography. new
zealand white rabbits were immunized at multiple sites
with the fusion protein emulsified in complete freund’s
adjuvant, and thereafter a booster injection was given every
third week with the fusion protein in incomplete freund’s
adjuvant. sera were collected before (preimmune serum)
and 6 weeks after the first injection. the antiserum was
used in western analysis without further purification as
described below.

isolation of osteoclast vacuolar h1-atpase
osteoclasts were isolated from egg-laying hens after 14
days on a calcium-deprived diet as previously described(9)

osteoclast  xxxg215xxx  b-subunit
with the exception that the cells were allowed to sediment
for 1 h on the second serum gradient. a final osteoclast
purity of 1:4 (osteoclast:contaminating cells) was obtained.
due to the large size of the osteoclast (50 –100 mm) compared with the smaller contaminating cells it is estimated
that greater than 90% of the plasma membranes are derived from osteoclasts in this preparation. osteoclast
plasma membrane vesicles containing the ruffled membrane were prepared as described elsewhere.(4) the osteoclast membrane vesicle preparation used in the present
study was previously characterized by cell surface labeling
which indicated that at least 25% of the total membranes
and 50% of the vesicles in the preparation were derived
from the osteoclast ruffled membrane.(4)
the vacuolar h1-atpase present in the osteoclast membrane vesicles was partially purified as described recently,(9)
with some modifications. briefly, membrane vesicles were
diluted to 3 mg/ml in isolation buffer containing 10 mm
dtt and then solubilized by incubation in the presence of
1.5% polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether (c12e9) for 1 h 15
minutes at 58c. glycerol was added (10% final concentration) and the mixture centrifuged at 150,000g for 1 h. the
supernatant was removed and ammonium sulfate was
added to 50% saturation. after incubation on ice for 15
minutes, the mixture was centrifuged at 100,000g for 30
minutes, 48c. the floating precipitate was collected and
resuspended in buffer a (20 mm tris/mes, ph 7.0, 0.05%
c12e9, 10 mm dtt, and 1 mm egta) and layered onto a
3.8 ml 15–30% (v/v) glycerol gradient prepared in buffer a.
fractions ('290 ml/fraction) were collected from the bottom to the top of the gradient and tested for  xxxd279xxx 
a1-sensitive atpase activity using the method previously
described.(24) fractions containing the peak  xxxd279xxx 
a1-sensitive atpase activity were used for the western
analysis. these fractions were also reconstituted into liposomes and tested for proton transport activity using methods described elsewhere.(9) the purified osteoclast h1atpase catalyzed  xxxd279xxx  a1-sensitive proton transport,
showing that a functional vacuolar h1-atpase had been
isolated (results not shown).

isolation of kidney medullary membrane h1-atpase
membrane vesicles from kidney medulla were prepared
from fresh bovine kidneys as described by gluck et al.,(12)
with some modifications. briefly, outer medullary tissue was
cut out and suspended at 1:6 w/v in isolation buffer (250
mm sucrose, 5 mm tris [ph 7.0], 1 mm nahco3, 1 mm
egta, and 1 mm dtt). the tissue was minced with
scissors, prehomogenized in a waring-blender set at low
speed for 30 s, and then homogenized in a teflon-glass
homogenizer with 10 strokes at '1500 rpm. the homogenate was centrifuged at 1000g for 5 minutes, the supernatant removed, and centrifuged at 6000g for 15 minutes. the
6000g supernatant was pelleted by centrifugation at
100,000g for 1 h, 48c. the pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer, frozen rapidly using meoh/dry ice, and then
stored at 2708c.
kidney membrane vesicles were partially purified using
the same method as described above for the osteoclast

755
h1-atpase. fractions containing peak  xxxd279xxx  a1-sensitive atpase activity were used for the western blot analysis. the isolated kidney h1-atpase catalyzed, after reconstitution into liposomes,  xxxd279xxx  a1-sensitive proton
transport (results not shown).

western blot analysis
protein fractions were separated on 8% sodium dodecyl
sulfide (sds)-polyacrylamide gels(25) and then transferred
electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane by blotting
at 100 v for 1 h using a biorad trans blot cell (biorad,
melville, ny, u.s.a.). after transfer, the membrane was
washed in rinse buffer (tris-buffered saline, tbs) consisting
of 10 mm tris/hcl, ph 7.5, 0.15 m nacl, 1 mm edta,
and 0.75% tween 20 for 15 minutes at room temperature
followed by 2 h incubation in tbs containing 5% nonfat dry
milk. after a 2 3 15 minute wash in tbs, the membrane
was incubated for 2 h with 1:4000 dilutions of the sequencespecific antibody or preimmune serum. the membrane was
then washed in tbs and bound antibody detected using
horseradish peroxidase-linked antirabbit immunoglobulin
(1:4000 dilution) and the ecl-detection kit (amersham).
to test antibody specificity, the b2 specific antibody (diluted 1:4000 in tbs containing 0.75% tween) was preincubated for 24 h at 58c in the presence or absence of 10 mm
of a synthetic peptide with the same sequence as the peptide that was used to generate the b2 antibody. western
blot analysis was then performed as described above.

immunocytochemistry
for immunocytochemical studies, rat osteoclasts were
isolated and cultured in vitro on bovine bone slices according to lakkakorpi et al.(26) osteoclasts cultured for 2 days
on bone slices were washed with phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs), fixed at room temperature with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes, and further permeabilized with icecold methanol for 5 minutes. the bone slices were then
incubated for 40 minutes in 10% swine serum followed by
30 minutes of incubation with sequence-specific antibody or
preimmune serum diluted 1:50 in 10% swine serum. after
rinsing the slices in pbs, they were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated swine antirabbit igg diluted 1:200 in 10%
swine serum for 30 minutes. after rinsing with pbs, cell
nuclei were stained with  xxxd2284xxx , and the bone slices
were then viewed in a leiz fluorescence microscope or with
a confocal laser scanning microscope (leica lasertechnic
gmbh, heidelberg, germany). to show antibody specificity of the b2 antibody, preabsorbed antisera was prepared
as described above for the western blot analysis except that
the b2 specific antibody was preincubated at 1:50 dilution in
the presence of 1 mm of the synthetic peptide. to identify
the ruffled border membrane, double immunofluorescence
staining of b2 was performed together with monoclonal
antibody f11 against the extracellular domain of the b3
subunit of the  xxxg1207xxx (27) was performed. fluoresceinisothiocyanate (fitc)-conjugated goat antimouse
igg was used as a secondary antibody for f11 (jackson
immunoresearch laboratories, west grove, pa, u.s.a.).

(0.2 mg of protein, lane 3), and osteoclast membranes (12

membranes (7 mg of protein, lane 4) was performed as
described in materials and methods using an b2 isoform
specific antibody. the numbers to the left indicate the
position of the molecular weight standards.

protein determination
protein was determined by the amido-schwartz method,(28) with bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) as a standard.

results
immunoblots using the antibody against the b1 isoform
showed a band at around 56 kd in the partially purified
kidney h1-atpase, indicating the presence of this isoform
in renal tissue (fig. 2a). the corresponding preimmune
serum did not react with any polypeptides in the 50 – 60 kd
region of the blot (results not shown). the b1-specific
antibody did not show any reaction either in the brain or
osteoclast preparations, suggesting that these tissues do not
contain the b1 isoform (fig. 2a). thus, although the osteoclast h1-atpase is believed to be present in the cell
membrane, it does not appear to have the b1 isoform.
the antibody against the b2 isoform of the vacuolar
h1-atpase reacted specifically and strongly with a peptide
at around 55– 60 kd in the purified bovine brain clathrincoated vesicle h1-atpase (fig. 3). thus, as expected, this
antibody recognized the b-subunit of a vacuolar h1atpase prepared from the brain. the antibody also reacted
specifically with polypeptides in the osteoclast and kidney
preparations at approximately the same molecular weight
as in the brain h1-atpase (fig. 3). the binding of the b2
antibody to the 55– 60 kd band was almost completely
abolished by preincubation of the antibody with 10 mm free
peptide, showing that the reaction was specific (results not
shown).

fig. 4. western blot of the h1-atpase preparations
from brain, kidney and osteoclasts using an antibody to a
conserved sequence of the b-subunit. western blot of the
bovine kidney h1-atpase (5 mg of protein, lane 1), the
clathrin-coated vesicle h1-atpase from bovine brain (0.2
mg of protein, lane 2), osteoclast h1-atpase (0.2 mg of
protein, lane 3) and osteoclast membranes (12 mg of protein, lane 4) was performed as described in materials and
methods using an antibody against a conserved peptide
sequence of the vacuolar h1-atpase b-subunit. the numbers to the left indicate the position of the molecular weight
standards.

the antibody against b2 reacted in the kidney h1atpase with a peptide at lower molecular weight compared
with the reaction of the antibody against b1. this can
clearly be seen in fig. 2b, where a blot of the kidney h1atpase were reacted with the antibody against b1 and then
reprobed with the antibody against b2. a similar result was
obtained if both isoform-specific antibodies were added at
the same time (result not shown). these experiments show
that the kidney h1-atpase preparation contains both iso-

fig. 5. immunocytochemical analysis of rat osteoclasts
using an anti-b2-specific antibody. rhodamine immunofluorescent staining of rat osteoclasts with anti-b2-specific
antibody (a and b) or b2 pre-immune serum (c) was
performed as described in materials and methods. osteoclasts shown in (a) and (c) were localized over resorption
lacunae whereas the osteoclast in (b) was not associated
with a resorption lacuna. note that the b2 antibody
showed an intense staining polarized to the cell surface
membrane (b, arrowheads).

forms of the b-subunit and that they have different apparent molecular weights. this result supports previous findings by nelson et al.(18) suggesting the presence of
structural isoforms of vacuolar h1-atpases in the urinary
tubuli.
the antibody against the conserved region was somewhat
less specific, staining a number of peptides on western blots
of preparations from kidney (fig. 4). however, the antibody
reacted most strongly with peptides in the expected 56 –58
kd region in the osteoclast, brain, and kidney atpase
preparations (fig. 4). the result with this antibody confirmed the results with the isoform-specific antibodies in
that a double band could be seen in the kidney h1-atpase,
most likely representing b1 and b2. in the osteoclast and
brain preparations, only one band could be detected. thus,
additional isoforms of the b-subunit were not revealed in
the osteoclast preparations.
to extend the results of the western analysis and to
investigate the cellular localization of the b subunit isoform(s) in the osteoclast, immunocytochemistry of rat osteoclasts on bovine bone slices was performed. in actively
resorbing osteoclasts, defined as a cell located over a resorption lacuna,(26) the b2 antibody showed an intense
staining polarized to the cell surface membrane (fig. 5a).
in contrast, osteoclasts not involved in bone resorption, as
judged by the absence of a resorption pit associated with the
cell, showed diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm
(fig. 5b). preimmune serum to the b2 antibody showed a
faint staining of the nuclei, but there was no reaction seen

at the cell membrane or any intracellular structures of the
osteoclasts (fig. 5c). the specificity of the b2 antibody was
confirmed by showing that the staining was abolished by
preincubation of the b2 antibody with free peptide with
same amino acid sequence as the peptide used to generate
the b2 antibody (data not shown). the antibody against the
b1 isoform did not show any staining either in the actively
resorbing or the resting osteoclast (data not shown). thus,
this result is in line with the western analysis suggesting
that the b1 isoform is not present in the osteoclast.
the pattern of immunofluorescence staining in the osteoclasts was further analyzed using laser scanning confocal
microscopy. in figs. 6a– 6c, three representative optical
sections of an active osteoclast are shown; at the level of the
nuclei, the bone surface and the resorption lacuna. at all
levels in the cell, a dot-like staining could be observed which
might indicate vesicular structures present in the cytosol of
the osteoclast. the most intense reaction, however, was
seen at the level of the bone surface, i.e., in the ruffled
border membrane area, where the staining was most intense
in regions adjacent to the sealing zone. the b2 staining
appeared to correspond roughly to the peripheral areas of
the resorption pit (fig. 6d). the localization of the b2
subunit in the ruffled membrane was further confirmed
using double immunofluorescence staining with anti-b3  xxxg1207xxx  antibodies. cross-sections of these stainings are shown in fig. 7. as expected, the antibody against
the  xxxg1207xxx  revealed staining both at the ruffled border and also at the membrane zone apposed to the

staining with the anti-b2 antibody. confocal images from

ruffled membrane (fig. 7b). the b2 staining was colocalized with the  xxxg1207xxx  to the ruffled membrane,
but the staining appeared to be most intense at the edges of
the ruffled membrane (fig. 7a). taken together, the ruffled border acid pump, as defined by b2 antibody staining,
appears to be concentrated to a specific area of the ruffled
membrane adjacent to the sealing zone.

discussion
the functional significance of isoforms of the b subunit is
not known. it has been speculated that isoforms of the
subunits might be one way of targeting the enzyme to
different membrane compartments. in the intercalated cell,
the  xxxg215xxx  is distributed between an intracellular
location and the plasma membrane depending on the stimulatory status of the cell.(18) it was therefore suggested that
the b1 isoform might contain information important for
this special targeting of the pump. despite the fact that it is
believed that the osteoclast acid pump is also inserted into
the cell membrane upon activation of the cell, we found no
evidence for the presence of the b1 isoform. instead, both
the western blotting of osteoclast membranes and immunocytochemistry in isolated osteoclasts suggest strongly that
the b2 isoform is present in the ruffled membrane of the
active osteoclast. thus, the b1 isoform is not obligatory for
targeting to the cell membrane.
the osteoclast is a specialized cell with defined function.
it is possible that the ruffled border acid pump has evolved

fig. 7. confocal images from double immunofluorescence staining for the  xxxg221xxx  and the  xxxg1207xxx . double staining of the osteoclast with the anti-b2
antibody and an antibody against the b3 subunit of the
 xxxg1207xxx  was performed as detailed in materials
and methods. cross-sections of the osteoclast computed
from optical sections taken at 0.25 mm intervals are shown
in (a) for the anti-b2 staining and in (b) for the  xxxg2422xxx 
staining. the  xxxg2422xxx  antibody reacted both at the ruffled membrane (b, arrows) and the membrane zone apposed to the bone surface (b, small arrowheads). note the

membrane (a, large arrowheads).

distinct properties suited to its role in bone resorption.
indeed, it has been reported that the osteoclast acid pump
differs in its catalytic properties and its inhibitor sensitivity
from other vacuolar h1-atpases.(10,29,30) furthermore,
chatterjee et al. have suggested that the osteoclast proton
pump contains a specific isoform of the  xxxg220xxx  in the
catalytic sector of the atpase.(10) the results in the present
report did not reveal an osteoclast-specific isoform of the
b-subunit in our preparations. there are, however, some
limitations of the study that must be borne in mind. first,
the antibodies used recognize short peptide sequences and
thus differences could exist in other parts of the peptide.
second, isoforms with the same electrophoretic mobility
would not be detected. recently, cloning and characterization of the b-subunit from a chicken cdna library as well
as human osteoclastoma cdna libraries has suggested that
only one form of the b-subunit exists in the osteoclast and
that is the b2 isoform.(20,31) taken together, the results
indicate that the b2 isoform is expressed in the osteoclast
and is located in the ruffled border of the actively resorbing
cell.
the polarization of the h1-atpase to the cell membrane
adjacent to the bone surface in the actively resorbing osteoclast is clearly demonstrated by the intense immunofluorescence staining of the osteoclast using the b2 antibody.
this was confirmed by the double staining with the antivitronectin receptor antibody. the b3 chain of the  xxxg1207xxx  has previously been shown to be present in the
ruffled membrane but absent from the sealing zone.(32) the
change in the localization of the  xxxg215xxx  from intracellular structures of nonresorbing cell to the ruffled border

osteoclast  xxxg215xxx  b-subunit
of the resorbing osteoclast is consistent with this form of the
acid pump playing a role in bone resorption.
our finding that the  xxxg215xxx  appears to be concentrated to areas of the ruffled membrane adjacent to the
sealing zone suggests that the ruffled membrane may not be
as homogenous as previously thought. one electron microscopy study using immunogold labeling has reported the
presence of the a-subunit of the acid pump in the ruffled
membrane. the distribution of the pump across the ruffled
border was, however, not reported.(33) it is of interest to
speculate whether such a division of the ruffled membrane
into domains could be of functional significance. this membrane is involved in the secretion of acid and proteolytic
enzymes onto the bone surface. it may also play a role in the
transport of dissolved mineral and collagen fragments away
from the bone surface. our studies suggest that acid secretion may occur predominantly at the edge of the ruffled
border. it is tempting to suggest that uptake might be
principally located in the center of the ruffled border. further studies are required to define the detailed mechanism
of the osteoclast ruffled membrane.
