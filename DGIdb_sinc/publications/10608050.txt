abstract. thrombolytic therapy has become a standard treatment for selected patients with acute myocardial infarction
(mi). various thrombolytic agents have been shown to decrease mortality. however, current thrombolytic agents still
suffer significant shortcomings, such as a low optimal reperfusion rate, delayed reperfusion, and incomplete myocardial
perfusion. furthermore, cyclic flow variations and reocclusion remain a significant cause of late morbidity and mortality. in thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator ( xxxg1766xxx ),
heparin seems to play an important role. however, it has several features that suggest that it may not be the optimal adjunct to thrombolytics, including weak and indirect action on
thrombin, little access to clot-bound thrombin, inhibition by
acute-phase plasma proteins, and its direct stimulation of
platelet aggregation.  xxxd218xxx  ( xxxd218xxx  ), a smallmolecule, synthetic, direct thrombin inhibitor, has several potential advantages over heparin, and prior studies suggest superior thrombin inhibition with favorable pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic properties warranting further investigation. the myocardial infarction using  xxxd218xxx   and tpa (mint) study is a phase ii, single-blind, angiographic
trial directly comparing heparin versus two doses of  xxxd218xxx  in 120 patients with st-elevation mi who present within
6 hours of symptom onset. the primary objective of the mint
trial is to assess the timi grade 3 flow and timi frame
count at 90 minutes after the initiation of  xxxg1766xxx . this trial
will also evaluate the safety of the combination of  xxxg1766xxx ,  xxxd218xxx , and aspirin. the incidence of clinical or silent ischemia will be monitored. all patients will be followed up to 30
days for the composite endpoint of death, nonfatal recurrent
myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, ptca,
recurrent ischemia, and shock/new-onset heart failure.

thrombolytic therapy represents a major advance in
the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (mi).
while previous treatment for acute mi was passive,
treating the consequences of mi, such as arrhythmias
or heart failure, the introduction of thrombolytics has
provided a means to treat the cause of mi, leading to
limitation of infarct size, preservation of left ventricular function, and improvement of short-term and longterm survival [1–4]. however, current thrombolytic
regimens still have significant shortcomings, including
(1) low reperfusion rate (timi grade 3 flow in 54%);
(2) time delay to reperfusion averaging 45 minutes;
(3) reocclusion of the infarct-related artery after initial
successful reperfusion in 5–10% of patients [5–8],
which is associated with significantly increased mortality [9]; and (4) major bleeding, including intracranial
bleeding in up to 0.7% of patients treated [2,4].
these remaining problems in thrombolytic therapy
appear to be at least in part related to thrombin activity. in the early phase of thrombolysis, the activity of
an exogenous thrombolytic agent is counterbalanced
by the continuous, endogenous generation of thrombin, which prevents and delays successful recanalization. as thrombolysis progresses, the partially lysed
thrombus exposes internal fresh thrombin with activation of platelets and generation of fibrin, leading to re-

thrombosis and reocclusion. early effective inhibition
of thrombin will shift the balance away from thrombogenesis toward thrombolysis, thereby increasing the
recanalization rate and shortening the time delay to
thrombolysis. in addition, it will also prevent reocclusion following successful thrombolysis. finally, nonselective inhibition of thrombin increases the risk of
bleeding by inhibiting several other coagulation factors. therefore, thrombin appears to play a crucial
role in both thrombosis and thrombolytic therapy.
the only currently available thrombin inhibitor,
heparin, has been shown to play an important role in
enhancing thrombolysis induced by  xxxg1766xxx  [10,11]. however, heparin is an indirect thrombin inhibitor, requiring  xxxg2056xxx , and is easily inhibited by acutephase proteins that are present in acute mi. due to
the large molecular weight of the heparin– xxxg2056xxx  complex, it has limited access to clot-bound
thrombin. in addition, heparin also stimulates platelets and potentiates the effects of various agonists for
platelet activation.
direct thrombin inhibitors, on the other hand, have
several potential advantages over heparin. they do not
require a cofactor to inhibit thrombin, are not inhibited by  xxxg1726xxx  or acute-phase proteins, and
do not activate platelets. in vitro and in vivo studies
have shown that these direct thrombin inhibitors are
more potent than heparin for the inhibition of thrombin activity.  xxxd218xxx  has been shown to be significantly more potent than hirudin for inhibiting clotbound thrombin [12].
 xxxd218xxx  , or  xxxd218xxx  (2r, 4r)-4-methyl-1[n2-(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfonyl)1-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid monohydrate, is
a small-molecule, synthetic, direct thrombin inhibitor
derived from l-arginine (figure 1) and acts by directly and reversibly blocking the active catalytic site
of thrombin [13]. it has no inhibitory activity against
other serine proteases, except at concentrations in excess of 100 times those required for thrombin, and is

thus highly selective at clinically useful doses. it inhibits all the physiologic effects of thrombin, including
conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, platelet aggregation, and activation of factors v and viii. phase i
pharmacokinetic studies showed a dose-related prolongation of several pharmacodynamic measures of an
anticoagulant/antithrombotic effect. the prolongations
of aptt at the doses of 1.25, 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 µg/kg/
min were 47 6 1, 57 6 3, 72 6 3, and 87 6 4 (mean 6
sem) seconds, respectively [14].
the in vivo studies showed that  xxxd218xxx  can indeed enhance thrombolysis induced by  xxxg1766xxx . in the
rabbit experiment,  xxxd218xxx , as compared with heparin, increased the reperfusion rate from 71% to 92%
and shortened the time delay to reperfusion from 34
to 13 minutes. furthermore, reocclusion or cyclic flow
changes following initial reperfusion were significantly
reduced. finally, the scanning electron micrograpic
study showed a marked reduction of residual thrombus in the  xxxd218xxx -treated animals [15].  xxxd218xxx  has also been shown to prevent platelet-mediated
thrombosis [16,17]. similar findings were also observed in the dog coronary artery thrombosis model
[18]. these studies led us to design the mint trial to
confirm the findings that  xxxd218xxx  in conjunction
with  xxxg1766xxx  indeed enhances thrombolysis and prevents
reocclusion.

myocardial infarction using
 xxxd218xxx   and  xxxg1766xxx  (mint)
mint is a randomized, single-blind, multicenter, international trial of 120 patients with acute myocardial
infarction who present within 6 hours of pain onset.
the patients who meet all inclusion and no exclusion
criteria will be randomized in a single-blind fashion to
receive either one of two doses of  xxxd218xxx  or heparin as adjunctive therapy to  xxxg1766xxx  and aspirin. these
patients will undergo acute cardiac catheterization to
assess timi grade flow and timi frame counts [19]
of the culprit artery at 90 minutes after  xxxg1766xxx  administration (figure 2).  xxxg1766xxx  will be given as a front-loaded
regimen, with 15 mg as a bolus followed by 0.75 mg/
kg up to 50 mg over the next 30 minutes, and followed

fig. 2. mint study design

mi using  xxxd218xxx  tpa (mint) study

by 0.5 mg/kg up to 35 mg over the next 60 minutes.
all patients will receive 160–325 mg aspirin orally
within 1 hour prior to the beginning of  xxxg1766xxx  and each
day throughout the 30-day follow-up. patients will be
randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either low-dose
 xxxd218xxx , high-dose  xxxd218xxx , or heparin therapy.
a bolus of 100 µg/kg of argtroban will be given over 1
minute, followed by an infusion of either 1.0 µg/kg/min
or 3.0 µg/kg/min. heparin will be administered as a
bolus of 70 units/kg over 1 minute, followed by an infusion of 15 units/kg/h (up to 1500 units/h). after the
first 6 hours, the dose of study medication will be
adjusted to maintain an aptt between 50 and 70 seconds. other medications, including morphine, betablockers, nitroglycerin, ace inhibitors, or vasopressive amines, can be used as required for patient
management.
the primary endpoint of the study is the angiographic determination of timi grade 3 flow and timi
frame count at 90 minutes. secondary endpoints are
the incidence of silent ischemia during the 48 hours
following the initiation of  xxxg1766xxx  and safety. all patients
will be followed up to 30 days for clinical events consisting of death, nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (ptca), coronary artery bypass graft (cabg),
shock/new-onset congestive heart failure, and recurrent ischemia.
eligible patients include males or nonpregnant females age 21 or older with ischemic chest discomfort
lasting at least 30 minutes with associated st-segment
elevation $0.2 mv in at least two contiguous precordial leads or at least 0.1-mv st-segment elevation in
at least two limb leads. the time interval between the
onset of chest pain and the initiation of study medication should be less than 6 hours. patients with an increased risk of bleeding or a stroke, hemodynamic instability, a recent history of angioplasty, or a history
of coronary artery bypass surgery are excluded. the
doses of 1.0 and 3.0 µg/kg/min were chosen on the basis of a pilot experience in patients with acute mi receiving  xxxg1766xxx ; these doses prolonged aptt to 51 and 68
seconds, respectively, at steady state (12 hours) [14].
these relatively low doses were selected in order to
maintain an aptt below 90 seconds based on the experience with the gusto iia [20] and timi 9a [21] trials. these two doses provide an opportunity not only
to evaluate the dose-response effect of  xxxd218xxx 
with  xxxg1766xxx  in acute mi, but also to prove the existence
of the ‘‘thrombin paradox.’’ in previous studies using
hirudin and hirulog, there were suggestions that a lowdose, direct thrombin inhibitor may be more effective
than a high-dose one [22,23], which can be explained
by preservation of  xxxg2277xxx  and the protein c
pathway [24].
assuming timi grade 3 flow rates of 54% in heparin patients, with a total of 120 patients in this study,
the timi grade 3 flow rate would need to be $84% in

51

 xxxd218xxx -treated patients at the most effective dose
to have a reasonable chance of detecting a significant
difference with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05 and a
power of 0.80.
two substudies are planned. one substudy will investigate the possibility of a ‘‘rebound’’ hypercoagulable phenomenon by measuring various coagulation parameters. a second substudy will combine results from
patients undergoing 90-minute angiography in a companion trial, ami ( xxxd218xxx  in myocardial infarction), with streptokinase and  xxxd218xxx , to identify clinical predictors of poor (i.e., timi grade flow
#2) angiographic outcomes.
the mint trial is being coordinated by investigators in the cardiac unit of the massachusetts general
hospital, harvard medical school, boston, massachusetts. coromed, inc. (troy, ny) is serving as the clinical data monitoring and data coordination center. the
study is sponsored by texas biotechnology corporation (houston, tx).
