summary
retinoids are natural and synthetic compounds related to  xxxd3417xxx  that act through interaction with two basic types of nuclear receptors:
 xxxd3417xxx  receptors (raralpha, rarbeta and rargamma) and retinoid x receptors (rxralpha, rxrbeta and rxrgamma) as ligand-activated, dna-binding, transacting, transcription-modulating proteins involved in a general molecular mechanism responsible for transcriptional responses in target genes.
function of retinoids in organisms affecting broad spectrum of various biochemical and molecular biology reactions is unimaginable without fully
functional nuclear receptors – retinoid inducible transcription factors.  xxxd2071xxx  exert tumour-suppressive activity due to their antiproliferative
and apoptosis-inducing effects. a number of novel retinoids and rexinoids acting through cognate nuclear receptors have been tested both in vitro
and in vivo, using cell culture or animal models for breast cancer.
this article briefly summarizes the role and properties of nuclear retinoid/rexinoid receptors as well as selected effects of  xxxd2071xxx  or
selected synthetic retinoids and rexinoids with respect to their potential use in chemoprevention of breast cancer.

key words: retinoids, rexinoids, nuclear retinoid acid receptors, prevention of breast cancer, regulation of gene transcription

introduction

represent a superfamily of hormone or other biologically active
ligand-inducible transcription factors. the molecules of nuclear
retinoid receptors contain several specific domains from which
the amino terminal a/b-domain of the nuclear receptor molecule
contains a constitutive activation function ( xxxg1143xxx   xxxg1865xxx ). the central
c-domain is a cysteine-rich dna-binding region consisting of two
highly conserved zinc fingers, the d-domain represents a highly
flexible structure, and it plays a role as a hinge of the receptor
molecule. the carboxy-terminal e-domain is responsible for
both retinoid binding and dimerization, and it contains inducible
transactivation function (af-2) (4, 5) (fig. 1). all-trans retinoic

breast cancer is still the most common form of cancer death
in women in europe, with 129 900 deaths in the year 2004 (1).
chemoprevention, which is defined as the prevention of cancer
by pharmacological agents that inhibit or reverse the process
of carcinogenesis, has thus increasingly become the focus of
breast cancer prevention efforts (2). a number of novel retinoid
derivatives, which appear to be of promise based on preclinical
and epidemiological data, are at present under investigation.
retinoids comprising  xxxd3105xxx  (retinol), their natural metabolites
are involved in the complex arrangements of physiological and
developmental responses in many tissues of higher vertebrates
that include embryonic development, vision, reproduction, bone
formation, haematopoiesis, metabolism, growth and differentiation of a variety of cell types, apoptosis and processes of carcinogenesis. important carboxyl group containing natural derivatives
of retinol include all-trans –, 9-cis – and 13-cis  xxxd2071xxx . in
higher organisms,  xxxd3417xxx  is considered to be the
main biologically active form of  xxxd3105xxx  (3).

nuclear retinoid receptors
discovery of the nuclear receptor superfamily that includes
nuclear receptors for steroid and thyroid hormones, retinoids,
 xxxd408xxx  and a number of “orphan“ nuclear receptors
for which ligands are still unknown, was a breakthrough in the
field of understanding retinoid mediated mechanism of action
in the cell. it is generally accepted that those nuclear receptors

are able to inhibit mammary gland cancer in animal models and
human breast cancer. they are effective inhibitors of breast cancer
cells at the early stages of tumour progression and their effectiveness diminishes as tumours become more aggressive (17, 18).
1-methyl-1-nitrosourea (mnu) is a well characterized carcinogen
that induces adenocarcinomas in rat mammary gland with high
specificity. this model has proven to be of resemblance to human
breast cancer and is therefore of great interest for mammary gland
tumour studies (19). our data has shown that among the total
number of lesions classified, the percentage of invasive tumours
ranged from 35% to 44% in female sprague-dawley rats treated
with mnu. no metastases were observed in other organs in mnu
treated animals (20-22).
recently, we have shown that expression of raralpha, rxralpha,
thyroid  xxxg1603xxx -alpha, both alpha- and beta-forms of estrogen
receptors, nuclear receptor coregulators (n-cor,  xxxg1510xxx , smrt)
and  xxxg682xxx  (egfr) in rat was significantly increased in postlactating mammary gland when compared
to that of nonlactating mammary tissue. postlactating mammary
glands were found to express all rar and rxr subtypes studied
when compared to nonlactating mammary tissues that express
exclusively raralpha and rxralpha subtypes. enhanced expression
of a number of nuclear hormone receptors, their coregulators in
mammary tissue of postlactating rats in comparison with nonlactating animals identify a potential role for retinoid, thyroid
and estrogen signalling pathways also after lactation period (23).
also, a different pattern of expression of retinoid or rexinoid
receptors was found in mnu-induced mammary carcinomas in
both hypothyroid and hyperthyroid rats (24). in general, retinoids
regulate expression of several hundred genes through binding to
nuclear transcription factors. thus, substantial progress has been
made in understanding of retinoid metabolism and function (25,
26). 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx , a high affinity ligand for rxrs as well
as  xxxd330xxx  ( xxxd330xxx ,  xxxd330xxx ), a synthetic rxr-selective
ligand were shown to have efficacy superior to all-trans retinoic
acid as a chemopreventive compound in the mnu-induced rat
mammary gland carcinoma model. moreover,  xxxd330xxx  was very
well tolerated during chronic therapy with no classic signs of
“retinoid-associated” toxicities.
in animal mammary gland carcinoma models, additional promising retinoids are  xxxd3106xxx  or n-(4hydroxyphenyl)retinamide ( xxxd2099xxx ) (27-29). also, it has
been referred that a combination of ligands for peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-gamma ( xxxg1807xxx ) as troglitazone and
ligands for rars and/or rxrs may have a marked therapeutic
role for breast cancer (30). the lack of rarbeta gene expression
is a typical feature for human breast cancer and is considered to
be one of the major factors responsible for retinoid resistance
in those neoplasias. determination of the expression of all the
subtypes of rars and rxrs in a number of hormone-dependent
and hormone-independent breast cancer cells have shown similar
expression of raralpha, rargamma, rxralpha and rxrbeta. however, alltrans  xxxd3417xxx  was found to be a strong inductor of the rarbeta
gene expression in several hormone-dependent breast cancer cell
lines. due to up-regulation of rarbeta by  xxxd3417xxx  or
other retinoids, the expression of rarbeta apparently plays a critical
role in increasing retinoid sensitivity. these data indicate that
the deficiency of the rarbeta expression and a deficient responsiveness of retinoids via rarbeta may account for the ineffective

acid receptors (rars) upon  xxxd3417xxx  binding act as
 xxxd3417xxx -inducible transcription factors by directly
interacting as heterodimers with 9-cis  xxxd3417xxx  receptor (retinoid x receptor, rxr) (6). the rar/rxr heterodimer interacts
with specific dna response elements of target genes and its
effect on transcription is mediated also through recruitment of
coregulators (corepressors and coactivators). ligand occupancy
of both receptors in rar/rxr heterodimers synergistically
increases transcriptional activity. diversity of the retinoic acidinduced signalling pathway is associated with existence of at
least three subtypes of rars ( xxxg1931xxx , rar beta, rar gamma) and
three subtypes of rxrs (rxr alpha, rxr beta, rxr gamma) with distinct
amino- and carboxy-terminal domains. rar/rxr heterodimers
bind to specific dna sequence –  xxxd3417xxx  response elements
(rares), characterized by direct repeats of two hexamers
(a/g)ggtca separated predominantly by five nucleotides
(dr+5) or two nucleotides (dr+2) (7-9) (fig. 2). in the absence of
 xxxd3417xxx , the rar/rxr heterodimer recruits nuclear
receptor corepressor proteins, e.g. nuclear receptor corepressor
(n-cor) or silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone
receptor (smrt) (10).  xxxd3417xxx  binding leads to the
dissociation of corepressor proteins and enables association of
coactivator proteins with liganded receptor complex yielding in
chromatin decondensation and activation of gene transcription.
the retinoids selective for specific binding to rxrs are called
rexinoids (11) and rxrs play an crucial role in the nuclear
receptor mediated transcription processes for their ability to
heterodimerize with many other members of nuclear receptor
superfamily, including rars, thyroid hormone receptors, vitamin
 xxxg657xxx ,  xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx ),
liver x receptor (lxr) and  xxxg1597xxx  (fxr)
(12, 13). rxrs behave as promiscuous dimerization partners for
a large number of nuclear receptors, and thus play an integrative
and crucial role in nuclear receptor mediated pathways, suggesting
that specific rxr ligands (rexinoids) might modulate transcription processes of target genes independently of rars (14-16).

treatment with retinoids in patients with advanced breast tumour
(14, 31, 32).
the potency of retinoids to inhibit proliferation of breast
cancer cells was seen when retinoids were administered either
alone or in combination with antiestrogens. in animal models, the
synergistic effects in inhibiting the initiation and promotion of
mammary gland tumours induced by carcinogens were observed
when retinoids were used in combination with ovariectomy or
antiestrogens. tamoxifen and  xxxd2099xxx  combination therapy has
been proven to be an active treatment regimen in metastasis breast
cancer patients, however, not in  xxxg730xxx  negative metastasis breast cancer or in patients whose disease had progressed
on tamoxifen (14, 32). retinoids do not require estrogen receptors
for their action, they may affect neoplastic transformation in
estrogen-negative cells, in contrast to tamoxifen, whose primary
mechanism of action is through estrogen receptors (33). as to
rarbeta2 expression, it seems to be decreased in intraepithelial
neoplasias through hypermethylation, since retinoids have been
proposed as attractive partners for demethylating agents (34, 35).
retinoids acting predominantly through rarbeta can promote apoptosis in breast cancer cells as well as in other types of neoplasias
(36). relationship between retinoids, which can act as effective
cancer chemopreventive agents or potential chemotherapeutic
compounds against breast cancer, and the regulation of the processes such as differentiation and apoptosis is very complex and
requires identification of new target genes that might be involved
in those processes. recently, we have studied the effect of 13-cis
 xxxd3417xxx  on the gene expression profile of tumour tissue in
a mnu-induced mammary gland carcinoma rat model by the use
of a commercial cdna macro array (atlas rat toxicology array
1.2, clontech). the results have shown different expression of
a number of genes encoding nuclear proteins and proteins involved in  xxxd3105xxx  metabolism in the retinoid treated mnu group
versus mock treated mnu group (37).

conclusion

18.

in spite of a number of important findings achieved recently by
many prestigious laboratories, the precise mechanism(s) by which
natural or synthetic retinoids or retinoid inhibit breast cancer
cell growth has not been completely elucidated. the generation
of novel reinoids and rexinoid with receptor subtype selectivity
has opened new opportunities for cancer therapy and chemoprevention. these compounds should be restricted to particular
malignancies thus increasing the therapeutic benefit. in spite
of that progress, there is still an urgent call for novel synthetic
retinoids and retinoid with greater retinoid receptor selectivity,
reasonable chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic effects and
reduced toxicity and side effects (14, 38, and 39).
