cardiac electrophysiological actions of the histamine h1-receptor antagonists  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine compared with chlorpheniramine and pyrilam...  we compared the cardiac electrophysiological actions of two types of h1-receptor antagonists--the piperidines,  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine, and the nonpiperidines, chlorpheniramine and  xxxd3050xxx -in vitro in guinea pig ventricular myocytes and in vivo in chloralose-anesthetized dogs.  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine significantly increased action potential duration of guinea pig myocytes. this concentration-dependent prolongation of action potential duration was reverse frequency dependent and led to development of early afterdepolarizations, which occurred more frequently at higher concentrations and slower pacing frequencies.  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine potently blocked the rapidly activating component of the delayed rectifier, ikr, with ic50 values of 1.5 and 50 nmol/l, respectively.  xxxd1891xxx  mumol/l, terfenadine but not  xxxd236xxx  blocked the slowly activating component of the delayed rectifier, iks (58.4 +/- 3.1%), and the inward rectifier,  xxxg1160xxx   xxxg1267xxx  (20.5 +/- 3.4%). chlorpheniramine and  xxxd3050xxx  blocked ikr relatively weakly (ic50 = 1.6 and 1.1 mumol/l, respectively) and iks and  xxxg1160xxx   xxxg1267xxx  less than 20%  xxxd1891xxx  mumol/l.  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine (1.0 to 3.0 mg/kg iv) significantly prolonged the qtc interval and ventricular effective refractory period in vivo. chlorpheniramine and  xxxd3050xxx  (< or = 3.0 mg/kg) did not significantly affect these parameters. block of repolarizing k+ currents, particularly  xxxg1160xxx   xxxg1267xxx , by  xxxd236xxx  and terfenadine produces reverse rate-dependent prolongation of action potential duration and development of early afterdepolarizations, delays ventricular repolarization, and may underlie the development of torsade de pointes ventricular arrhythmias observed with the use and abuse of these agents.
