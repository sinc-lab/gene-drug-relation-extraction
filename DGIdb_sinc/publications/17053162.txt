the intestinal barrier is composed of a single layer of columnar epithelium that serves as the body’s first line of defense
against a hostile environment within the intestinal lumen (18,
21, 35). barrier properties of the epithelium are in large part
regulated by interepithelial tight junctions (tjs), which reside
at the apical-most region of the paracellular space (3, 34, 36).
tjs polarize the cell into apical and basolateral regions (fence
function) and regulate passive diffusion of solutes and macromolecules (gate function) (3).
intestinal ischemia is an important mechanism of intestinal
barrier injury (27, 31, 40). ischemic injury causes disruption of
the tj protein complexes and enhances epithelial permeability,

permitting transmigration of luminal bacterial toxins and antigens into subepithelial tissues and the circulation (44). such
mucosal injury has resulted in high mortality rates ranging
between 59% and 93% (2, 28, 44). it is also becoming increasingly evident that many critically ill patients suffer from
multiple organ failure initiated by poor splanchnic perfusion
and resultant loss of intestinal barrier properties (17, 31, 41).
multiple organ failure is the leading cause of death in intensive
care unit patients (31).
the molecular mechanisms of ischemia-induced disruption
of barrier function have been studied predominantly in cell
models that mimic cellular events that occur during ischemia,
such as atp depletion/repletion and ca2⫹ switch assays (14,
47, 55). these models demonstrate that the critical event
defining disruption of barrier function is the loss of tj architecture and redistribution of tj proteins such as  xxxg1625xxx  and
zonula occludens-1 ( xxxg2286xxx ) from the apical tjs. tj reparative
events involve recruitment and reorganization of  xxxg1625xxx  and
 xxxg2286xxx  to the apical tight junctional region. however, these
mechanisms are poorly understood.
in our previous work, we demonstrated a critical role for cl⫺
secretion in the repair of intestinal barrier function in ischemia-injured porcine ileum. activation of cl⫺ secretory pathways with the nonselective secretory agonist prostaglandin
(pg)e2 triggered rapid recovery of transepithelial electrical
resistance (ter) in ischemia-injured ileum and reduced mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of 3h-labeled mannitol (9, 11, 12, 37).
inhibition of basolateral cl⫺ uptake in these tissues abolished
the pge2-mediated secretory response and prevented full restoration of ter levels, confirming the important role of cl⫺
secretion in mucosal barrier repair in this model (11, 37).
recent studies utilizing selective cl⫺ channel inhibitors revealed that recovery of ter is mediated solely through type 2
chloride channels ( xxxg472xxx ) expressed in the apical tj of restituted villus epithelium (37).
the  xxxg472xxx  cl⫺ channel is expressed in a variety of mammalian secretory epithelia and epithelial cell lines but plays a
relatively minor role in cl⫺ transport and fluid secretion (8, 38,
46). knockout of the  xxxg472xxx  gene disrupts normal development
of retinal pigment epithelium and the blood-testis barrier (13),
although there were no measurable effects on basal secretion
[in terms of short-circuit current (isc)] in  xxxg472xxx -null mouse
colonic epithelia (56). there is also increasing evidence for a
role of  xxxg472xxx  in absorptive processes because of its basolateral
localization in duodenal and colonic surface epithelium (15,
42)  xxxg472xxx  has also been localized to the interepithelial tj

recovery of mucosal barrier function in ischemic porcine ileum
and colon is stimulated by a novel agonist of the  xxxg472xxx  chloride
channel,  xxxd2513xxx . am j physiol gastrointest liver physiol

doi:10.1152/ajpgi.00183.2006.—previous studies utilizing an ex
vivo porcine model of intestinal ischemic injury demonstrated that
prostaglandin (pg)e2 stimulates repair of mucosal barrier function
via a mechanism involving cl⫺ secretion and reductions in paracellular permeability. further experiments revealed that the signaling mechanism for pge2-induced mucosal recovery was mediated via
type-2 cl⫺ channels ( xxxg472xxx ). therefore, the objective of the present
study was to directly investigate the role of  xxxg472xxx  in mucosal repair
by evaluating mucosal recovery in ischemia-injured intestinal mucosa
treated with the selective  xxxg472xxx  agonist  xxxd2513xxx . ischemia-injured porcine ileal mucosa was mounted in ussing chambers,
and short-circuit current (isc) and transepithelial electrical resistance
(ter) were measured in response to  xxxd2513xxx . application of
0.01–1 ␮m  xxxd2513xxx  to ischemia-injured mucosa induced concentration-dependent increases in ter, with 1 ␮m  xxxd2513xxx  stimulating a twofold increase in ter (⌬ter ⫽ 26 ⍀ 䡠 cm2; p ⬍ 0.01).
however,  xxxd2513xxx  (1 ␮m) stimulated higher elevations in ter
despite lower isc responses compared with the nonselective secretory
agonist pge2 (1 ␮m). furthermore,  xxxd2513xxx  significantly (p ⬍
0.05) reduced mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of 3h-labeled mannitol to
levels comparable to those of normal control tissues and restored
 xxxg1625xxx  localization to tight junctions. activation of  xxxg472xxx  with the
selective agonist  xxxd2513xxx  stimulated elevations in ter and reductions in mannitol flux in ischemia-injured intestine associated with
structural changes in tight junctions. prostones such as  xxxd2513xxx 
may provide a selective and novel pharmacological mechanism of
accelerating recovery of acutely injured intestine compared with the
nonselective action of prostaglandins such as pge2.

 xxxg472xxx  mediates recovery of barrier function

colocalized with tj proteins  xxxg2286xxx  and  xxxg1625xxx  in mouse and
porcine intestinal mucosa (23, 29, 37). activation of  xxxg472xxx 
occurs under various physiological conditions and in periods of
cellular stress (1, 8, 24, 43, 45). the exact role of  xxxg472xxx  in
intestinal injury and repair is poorly understood.
 xxxd2513xxx  (sucampo pharmaceuticals) is a novel bicyclic
fatty acid of the prostone group that has demonstrated selectivity for activation of  xxxg472xxx  cl⫺ currents in human colonic
t84 and  xxxg472xxx -transfected human embryonic kidney (hek)
cells (16).  xxxd2513xxx  has been shown to induce intestinal
fluid secretion when administered orally (53) and has demonstrated clinical efficacy in treatment of patients with constipation (25, 26). the objective of the present experiments was to
evaluate the effects of  xxxd2513xxx  on restoration of mucosal
barrier function in the ischemia-injured porcine intestine.

experimental porcine surgeries. all studies were approved by the
north carolina state university institutional animal care and use
committee. six- to 8-wk-old yorkshire crossbred pigs of either sex
were housed individually and maintained on a commercial pelleted
feed. pigs were held off feed for 24 h before experimental surgery.
general anesthesia was induced with xylazine (1.5 mg/kg im), ketamine (11 mg/kg im), and thiopental (15 mg/kg iv) and was maintained with intermittent infusion of thiopental (6 – 8 mg 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 h⫺1).
pigs were placed on a heating pad and ventilated with 100% o2 via a
tracheotomy with a time-cycled ventilator. the jugular vein and
carotid artery were cannulated, and blood gas analysis was performed
to confirm normal ph and partial pressures of co2 and o2. lactated
ringer solution was administered intravenously at a maintenance rate
of 15 ml 䡠 kg⫺1 䡠 h⫺1. the ileum and colon were approached via a
ventral midline incision. ileal or colonic segments were delineated by
ligating the intestine  xxxd1891xxx -cm intervals and subjected to ischemia by
occluding the local mesenteric blood supply for 45 min. for colonic
studies, the midregion of the ascending colon was selected.
ussing chamber studies. after the 45-min ischemic period, tissues
were harvested from the pig and the mucosa was stripped from the
seromuscular layer in oxygenated (95% o2-5% co2) ringer solution
(mm: 154 na⫹, 6.3 k⫹, 137 cl⫺, 0.3 h2po4, 1.2 ca2⫹, 0.7 mg2⫹, 24
hco⫺
3 , ph 7.4) containing 5 ␮m indomethacin to prevent endogenous pg production during the stripping procedure. tissues were then
mounted in 3.14-cm2-aperture ussing chambers, as described in
previous studies (4). for ussing chamber experiments, ileal or colonic
tissues from one pig were mounted on multiple ussing chambers and
subjected to different in vitro treatments. mean data are representative
of six ussing chamber experiments (n ⫽ 6 animals). tissues were
bathed on the serosal and mucosal sides with 10 ml of ringer solution.
the serosal bathing solution contained 10 mm glucose and was
osmotically balanced on the mucosal side with 10 mm mannitol.
bathing solutions were oxygenated (95% o2-5% co2) and circulated
in water-jacketed reservoirs. the spontaneous potential difference
(pd) was measured with ringer-agar bridges connected to calomel
electrodes, and the pd was short-circuited through ag-agcl electrodes with a voltage clamp that corrected for fluid resistance. ter
(⍀ 䡠 cm2) was calculated from the spontaneous pd and isc. if the
spontaneous pd was between ⫺1.0 and ⫹1.0 mv, tissues were
current-clamped at ⫾100 ␮a for 5 s and the pd was recorded. isc and
pd were recorded at 15-min intervals over a 4-h experiment.
experimental treatments. after tissues were mounted on ussing
chambers, they were allowed to acclimate for a period of 30 min to
achieve stable baseline measurements, after which experimental treatments were added.  xxxd2513xxx  {(⫺)-7-[(2r,4ar,5r,7ar)-2-(1,1difluoropentyl)-2-hydroxy-6-oxooctahydrocyclopenta[b]pyran-5-yl] xxxd2269xxx } was added to the mucosal side of tissues, except in select
experiments that assessed the effects of serosal treatment with lubi-

prostone. pge2 was added to the serosal side of tissues to stimulate
epithelial repair. in studies investigating the cl⫺ channel selectivity of
 xxxd2513xxx , tissues were pretreated (t ⫽ 0 min) with pharmacological cl⫺ channel inhibitors on the appropriate surface and then treated
with  xxxd2513xxx  (1 ␮m) on the serosal mucosal side of the tissue
(t ⫽ 30 min).
mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of [3h]mannitol. to assess mucosal
permeability after experimental treatments, 0.2 ␮ci/ml [3h]mannitol
was placed on the mucosal side of ussing chamber-mounted tissues.
after a 15-min equilibration period, standards were taken from the
mucosal side of each chamber and a 60-min flux period was established by taking 0.5-ml samples from the serosal compartment. the
presence of 3h was established by measuring ␤-emission in a liquid
scintillation counter (lkb wallac, model 1219 rack beta, perkin
elmer life and analytical sciences, boston, ma). unidirectional
[3h]mannitol fluxes from mucosa to serosa were evaluated by determining mannitol-specific activity added to the mucosal bathing solution and calculating the net appearance of tritium over time in the
serosal bathing solution on a chamber unit area basis.
histological examination. tissues were taken at 0, 60, and 240 min
for routine histological evaluation. tissues were sectioned (5 ␮m) and
stained with hematoxylin and eosin. for each tissue, three sections
were evaluated. for ileal tissues, four well-oriented villi and crypts
were identified in each section. villus length was obtained with a
micrometer in the eyepiece of a light microscope. in addition, the
height of the epithelium-covered portion of each villus was measured.
the surface area of the villus was calculated using the following
formula: villus surface area ⫽ 2␲ 䡠 1/2[(4/␲)d]h, where d is villus
diameter (width) at midpoint and h is villus height.
the formula was modified by subtracting the area of the base of the
villus and multiplying by a factor accounting for the variable position
at which each villus was cross-sectioned (5). the percentage of the
villous surface area that remained denuded was calculated from the
total surface area of the villus and the surface area of the villus
covered by epithelium. the percent denuded villous surface area was
used as an index of epithelial restitution.
immunofluorescence labeling of  xxxg1625xxx . immunofluorescence labeling was performed on ileal tissues that were embedded in optimal
cutting temperature medium, frozen, sectioned at 5-␮m thickness, and
fixed in cold 2-methylbutane (sigma-aldrich). tissue sections were
blocked with 2% bsa before incubation with rabbit anti- xxxg1625xxx 
polyclonal antibody (1:150, zymed, san francisco, ca) in normal
rabbit serum for 2 h at 4°c. sections were washed with pbs and
incubated for 45 min with fitc-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary
antibody (1:50; zymed) in the dark. sections were mounted, and
well-oriented villi were examined with a vanox ahs-3 photomicroscope linked to a spot rt slider cooled charge-coupled device digital
camera.
chemicals. indomethacin, 16,16-dimethyl-pge2,  xxxd3556xxx , bumetanide, and [3h]mannitol were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo).

university, manhattan, ks).  xxxd2513xxx  was obtained from sucampo pharmaceuticals.
statistical analysis. data are reported as means ⫾ se. all data
were analyzed by using an analysis of variance (anova) for repeated measures, except where the peak response was analyzed by
using a standard one-way anova (sigmastat, jandel scientific, san
rafael, ca). tukey’s procedure for multiple comparisons was used to
determine pairwise differences between treatments.

nonischemic control tissue, indicating significant disruption of
intestinal barrier function in these tissues. application of the
nonselective secretory agonist pge2 (1 ␮m) to the serosal side
of ischemic tissues induced elevations in ter (⌬ter ⫽ 26
⍀䡠cm2) that attained preischemic control levels within 45 min
of treatment with pge2. application of the  xxxg472xxx  agonist
 xxxd2513xxx  (0.1 and 1 ␮m) to the mucosal side of ischemiainjured mucosa induced concentration-dependent increases in
ter (fig. 1a), with 1 ␮m  xxxd2513xxx  stimulating an approximately twofold increase in ter (⌬ter ⫽ 25 ⍀䡠 cm2; p ⬍
0.01). concentration-dependent increases in isc were observed
in response to increasing concentrations of  xxxd2513xxx  (fig.
1, b and c). linear regression analysis revealed a significant
correlation (r ⫽ 0.67, p ⫽ 0.01) between the magnitude of the

 xxxg649xxx 

isc response induced by 1 ␮m  xxxd2513xxx  (in terms of ⌬isc)
and the ter recovery response (in terms of ⌬ter), whereas
no such correlation existed in ischemic tissue treated with
pge2 (r ⫽ 0.06, p ⫽ 0.82) (fig. 2). the significant correlation
between  xxxd2513xxx -stimulated isc and ter may represent a
more selective nature on  xxxg472xxx  cl⫺ channel activity compared
with pge2. however, it is unclear why no correlation existed
with pge2 treatment, as this agent would presumably have a
graded effect on cl⫺ transport mediated via  xxxg472xxx  even if it
also had effects on other cl⫺ channels.

epithelial cells regained their normal columnar appearance
(fig. 5d), which was indistinguishable from normal control

mucosal barrier function in the presence of  xxxd2513xxx  was
independent of the rate of epithelial restitution.
role of cl⫺ secretion on  xxxd2513xxx -induced recovery of
ter. to gain further insight into the role of cl⫺ secretion in
 xxxd2513xxx -induced recovery of ter, ischemia-injured ileal
mucosa was pretreated with the basolateral na⫹-k⫹-2cl⫺
cotransporter (nkcc)1 inhibitor bumetanide (400 ␮m), and
ter and isc were recorded in response to treatment with
 xxxd2513xxx  (1 ␮m). as shown in fig. 6, pretreatment of
ischemia-injured mucosa with bumetanide abolished the  xxxd2513xxx -induced isc and significantly inhibited initial rapid
elevations in ter (fig. 6).
 xxxd2513xxx  was shown previously to selectively activate
 xxxg472xxx  with no effect on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (cftr) in transfected hek cells (16).
to determine whether the mucosal barrier reparative properties
of  xxxd2513xxx  were linked to targeted  xxxg472xxx  channel activation in our model, ischemic mucosa were pretreated with
pharmacological inhibitors of  xxxg472xxx  and cftr and ter and
isc were measured in response to mucosal addition of  xxxd2513xxx  (1 ␮m). pretreatment of ischemic mucosa with the
 xxxg472xxx  inhibitor  xxxd3556xxx  (300 ␮m) inhibited but did not abolish
 xxxd2513xxx -induced isc (fig. 7b). this correlated with impaired recovery of ter (expressed as % increase in ter; fig.
7a). on the other hand, the cftr inhibitor dasu-02 (300
␮m) had no effect on isc or recovery of ter. why  xxxd2513xxx -evoked isc was only partially sensitive to  xxxd3556xxx  while
abolishing recovery of ter in these tissues is unclear. this
response may be due to nonspecific secretory pathways not
involved in repair of barrier function.

treated with  xxxd2513xxx .  xxxg1625xxx  is an integral membrane
protein expressed exclusively in the interepithelial tjs (49 –

nificantly lower compared with mucosal  xxxd2513xxx  treatment
(p ⬍ 0.01) and failed to evoke elevations in ter compared
with ischemia-injured control tissues. the biological importance of this serosal response is unclear. it is conceivable that
the serosal isc responses to  xxxd2513xxx  could be due to
translocation of this agent across leaky, injured epithelium. to
test this, additional experiments were performed in which
 xxxd2513xxx  was applied to the mucosal and serosal surfaces of
uninjured control tissues. mucosal and serosal application of
 xxxd2513xxx  induced significant isc responses (p ⬍ 0.05) in
control tissues. however, as with ischemic tissues, a significantly attenuated isc response was observed with serosal application of  xxxd2513xxx  compared with mucosal application
(by 3.4-fold) in these tissues (⌬isc ⫽ 48.2 ⫾ 14.3 and 14.2 ⫾

tissues, respectively; p ⬍ 0.05). overall, this suggests that
 xxxd2513xxx  exhibits more activity on mucosal surfaces of
porcine intestinal tissues regardless of whether the tissues are
injured. whether serosal isc responses by  xxxd2513xxx  are due
to activation of non- xxxg472xxx  pathways requires further investigation.
histological evaluation of recovering ischemia-injured mucosa treated with  xxxd2513xxx . to determine whether improvements in barrier function in response to  xxxd2513xxx 
treatment were due to enhanced epithelial restitution rates,
histological and morphological analyses of epithelial restitution on recovering ischemic tissues mounted on ussing chambers at select time points during the recovery period were
conducted. histological analysis of injured tissues revealed
sloughing and lifting of the intestinal epithelium at the tips of
villi (fig. 5b), which correlated with a 30% denuded surface
area of the epithelium as assessed by morphometric analysis
(table 1). within 60 min of mounting tissues on ussing
chambers, the intestinal villi had undergone rapid and complete
restitution as evidenced by contracted villi and migrating
epithelial cells that covered the surface of injured villi (fig.

mechanisms responsible for restoration of mucosal barrier
function in acutely injured intestinal mucosa include two major
events: epithelial restitution and closure of the paracellular
space and tjs. epithelial restitution is the initial reparative
event that involves villous contraction and epithelial cell migration, which act in concert to rapidly restore epithelial
continuity, a process that is independent of cellular proliferation (10, 11, 22, 39). closure of the paracellular space involves
reassembly of the interepithelial tj protein complexes and
restoration of epithelial barrier function (6, 47, 48, 54).
we have accumulated evidence for a critical role of  xxxg472xxx 
mediated cl⫺ secretion in recovery of mucosal barrier function
in ischemia-injured intestine (37). the objective of the present
studies was to test the hypothesis that targeted activation of
 xxxg472xxx  cl⫺ channels in ischemia-injured intestine would stimulate rapid repair and restoration of mucosal barrier function.
therefore, ischemia-injured porcine intestinal mucosa was
mounted on ussing chambers and indexes of barrier function
were assessed in response to treatment with the selective  xxxg472xxx 
agonist  xxxd2513xxx . in line with our hypothesis, mucosal
treatment of ischemia-injured porcine ileum and ascending
colon with the  xxxg472xxx  agonist  xxxd2513xxx  stimulated rapid
recovery of ter and significantly reduced mucosal permeability to the paracellular permeability marker mannitol. during
peak recovery of ter in ischemic tissues treated with  xxxd2513xxx ,  xxxg1625xxx  was localized exclusively to the tj, whereas
in untreated ischemic tissues  xxxg1625xxx  staining was diffuse. in
addition, pretreatment of injured tissues with the  xxxg472xxx  blocker
 xxxd3556xxx  prevented recovery of ter and  xxxg1625xxx  restoration.
however, it is noteworthy that  xxxd3556xxx  only partially inhibited
 xxxd2513xxx -stimulated isc in ischemic tissues despite recovery
of ter to nonischemic control levels. the significance of this
effect is unclear, but it may suggest that a portion of the isc
response evoked by  xxxd2513xxx  is not required for barrier
repair. previously reported data (37) showed similar findings
for pge2 and  xxxd3556xxx . however, in the latter study, pge2evoked isc was sensitive to cftr blockade with dasu-02,
whereas in the present study, dasu-02 was without effect on
 xxxd2513xxx -stimulated isc, suggesting that cftr is not a
major channel involved in isc responses and ter recovery
stimulated by  xxxd2513xxx . more studies are needed to determine the exact mechanisms by which  xxxg472xxx  activation, induced by  xxxd2513xxx , stimulates repair of barrier function,
especially with regard to the role of epithelial secretion.
the role of  xxxg472xxx  in epithelial injury and repair has not been
previously investigated. nonetheless, there is evidence demonstrating  xxxg472xxx  activation during cellular stress (1, 20), suggesting
that  xxxg472xxx  may play an important role in injury and repair
processes. in previous studies (37), we demonstrated increased
 xxxg472xxx  protein expression in ischemia-injured porcine ileal mucosa. in line with our findings,  xxxg472xxx  currents in t84 cells and
xenopus oocytes were shown to be activated by atp depletion
(20) and actin cytoskeleton disruption (1), respectively, both of

which model events during ischemic injury. recently, heat shock
protein 90 has been shown to associate with and enhance  xxxg472xxx 
activity, which may have important physiological consequences
during periods of cellular stress (24).
an interesting characteristic of  xxxg472xxx  that may provide
insight into the mechanism by which  xxxg472xxx  modulates intestinal barrier repair is its localization to the interepithelial tjs
(23).  xxxg472xxx  localization to this region of the cell may facilitate
interactions with tj proteins and associated regulatory molecules, which, in turn, may regulate the permeability characteristics of the paracellular pathway. in support of this hypothesis,
 xxxg472xxx  was shown to be critical to the formation of the epithelial barrier in other tissues. for example, the retinal pigment
epithelia and seminiferous tubules, both of which require close
cell-cell interactions for the establishment of epithelial bloodorgan barriers, fail to form properly in  xxxg472xxx -knockout mice,
resulting in degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and
testes, respectively (13). we have demonstrated the expression
of the tj  xxxg1625xxx  in  xxxg472xxx  immunoprecipitates in the porcine
ileum. in the present study, treatment of injured intestinal
tissues resulted in  xxxg1625xxx  redistribution from the cytoplasm
to lateral cellular membrane and tj. trafficking and redistribution of tj proteins from the cytosol to the tj is a critical
component of the resealing process of the tj and recovery of
epithelial resistance (7, 14, 32). the interactions between
 xxxg472xxx  and tj proteins during barrier repair require more study.
activation of  xxxg472xxx  with  xxxd2513xxx  resulted in elevations
in isc and restoration of preischemic ter levels. however, it is
not known whether cl⫺ transport is critical for repair or
whether activation  xxxg472xxx  channel alone is required, regardless
of whether it transports cl⫺. with regard to the former, it is
plausible that cl⫺ secretion could result in a lumen-directed
osmotic gradient serving to pull water from the paracellular
space and thus physically collapsing the paracellular space,
leading to elevations in ter (11, 30, 33). however, given the
marked disruption of the tj protein architecture that occurs
during ischemia in our model, it seems unlikely that an osmotic
gradient, resulting from luminal cl⫺ accumulation, would
form without some degree of tj integrity. moreover, inhibition
of cftr-mediated cl⫺ currents, which represent the major
cl⫺ secretory pathway induced by pge2 in our model, had no
influence on restoration of ter, suggesting that recovery of
ter is not a direct result of cl⫺ transport. however, it should
be noted that the cl⫺ uptake inhibitor bumetanide blocked
 xxxd2513xxx -stimulated isc and impaired recovery of ter.
this effect may be due to the requirement of intracellular cl⫺
for  xxxg472xxx  function that has been demonstrated in neuronal and
gastrointestinal tissues (15). the latter study showed predominantly basolateral expression of  xxxg472xxx  in surface epithelium of
the guinea pig colon.
results from the present experiments demonstrate that targeted activation of  xxxg472xxx  cl⫺ channels with  xxxd2513xxx 
stimulates repair of intestinal barrier function in the ischemiainjured porcine ileum and colon, associated with alterations in
tj structure. although prostanoids, particularly pge2, are also
capable of stimulating a similar reparative function, they appear to be less selective for the reparative process than the
prostone  xxxd2513xxx . therefore, from a clinical point of view,
 xxxd2513xxx  may provide a pharmacological method of inducing mucosal repair without undesired side effects such as
excessive mucosal secretion and altered motility patterns.
