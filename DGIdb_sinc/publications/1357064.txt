abstract
the effect of topical unilateral application of  xxxd2500xxx , an oc2-agonist, on ocular regional
blood flow was tested in anesthetized rabbits using radiolabeled microspheres. a significant
reduction in blood flow was found only in the ciliary body of the treated eye at 1 hr after  xxxd2500xxx 
treatment. however, the iop of both eyes was decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min post
 xxxd2500xxx  treatment. yohimbine (i.v.) blocked this iop lowering effect, but only partially prevented
the blood flow response. in addition, no significant difference was found in either basal or
 xxxd164xxx  stimulated short-circuit current or potential difference of the isolated rabbit
iris-ciliary body after 30 minutes of  xxxd2500xxx  treatment. these observations suggest that the iop
lowering effect of  xxxd2500xxx  appears to be mediated by oc2-receptors but unrelated to the reduction in
the ocular blood flow and net electrogenic ion transport.

introduction
the ability of 0c2-agonists to reduce the intraocular pressure (iop) has been established (1-3)
but not completely understood. these drugs appear to reduce iop by decreasing aqueous humor
formation (4). receptor binding studies indicate that rabbit iris ciliary body (icb) contains a large
number of 0c2-receptors (5) and jumblatt et al (6) and page et al (7) showed that most of the
a2-receptors of this tissue may be postjunctional. on the other hand, experimental evidence has
demonstrated that both cci- and cc2- adrenergic receptors are present in the vascular smooth muscle of
different species, including humans, and that both receptor subtypes may mediate vasoconstriction
(8). it is possible that a2-agonists lower iop by constricting the ocular blood vessels thereby
decreasing blood flow to the ciliary process and reducing aqueous humor formation. in the present
study, the effect of  xxxd2500xxx , an 0c2-agonist, on ocular blood flow of rabbits was tested using
radiolabeled microspheres. as active transport by the ciliary epithelium is one of the important
factors affecting aqueous humor formation, the effect of  xxxd2500xxx  on active ion transport across the
isolated in vitro rabbit icb was also examined.

animals and operative procedures
albino rabbits of either sex (2-3 kg) were used. anesthesia was induced with ketamine (50
and maintained by injection of a-chloralose (50 mg/kg, i.v.). a polyethylene catheter
was advanced into the left ventricle via the left subclavian artery for microsphere injections (correct
positioning of the catheter tip was confirmed by observing the characteristic left ventricular pressure
tracing). the femoral arteries of both sides were cannulated for measurement of systemic blood
pressure and collecting reference blood samples, respectively. the arterial blood pressure and heart
rate were continuously recorded with an 8-channel recorder (grass). the femoral vein on one side
was cannulated for saline or drug infusions. heparin, 500 i.u./kg was given i.v. to prevent clotting
and supplemented when needed.
all procedures involving animals conformed with the arvo resolution on the care and use
of animals in research.

mg/kg, i.m.)

drug preparation and administration
all drugs were prepared fresh daily

and expressed in term of salts.  xxxd2500xxx  hc1 was
dissolved in saline and 50 u.1 of 0.25%  xxxd2500xxx  solution was administered topically into the
conjunctiva! sac of one eye (treated eye) with the contralateral eye (untreated eye) receiving the same
volume of saline after the first injection of microspheres. yohimbine hc1 (0.5 mg/kg) in distilled
water was injected into the femoral vein 15 min before topical application of  xxxd2500xxx  in the
yohimbine +  xxxd2500xxx  group or 15 min before 50 |ll of saline was given in the yohimbine group. in
the control group, only 50 m„1 of saline was applied to the eye. the time gap between the first
injection of microspheres and the instillation of test compounds or vehicle was about 15-20 minutes.

regional blood flow measurement
regional blood flow in the eye was measured using radiolabeled microspheres. for each flow
measurement, about 500,000 microspheres of one type were injected into the ventricle (in 10s).
before injections, the microsphere solutions were well mixed. the reference blood samples were
collected at a constant rate of 1 ml/min by a pump connected to the femoral artery over a period of
150s starting from 10s before microsphere injection. blood flow was measured under two time
periods using differently labeled microspheres. the first microspheres were injected into the
ventricle before any drugs or saline were administered to the animals in order to measure the baseline
blood flow in the eye. the second labeled microspheres were injected 1 hr after drugs or saline were
given. at the end of the experiment, the animals were killed by an intracardiac injection of saturated
kc1. both eyes were enucleated and the iris, ciliary body and choroid removed by dissection. the
blood and tissue samples were weighed and the radioactivity was determined by
gamma-spectrometry. regional blood flow was calculated by the equation of heymann et al. (9): ft
fr x rt/rr ft is blood flow in the tissue under study (ml/min). fr is reference sample flow rate
(ml/min), and rt and rr are the radioactivities (cpm) in the tissues and references respectively. ft is
divided by the tissue sample weight and expressed as ml/min/g.

measurement of iop and

pupil diameter

iop was recorded with an alcon applanation pneumatonograph (surgical products division,
alcon laboratories, inc., ft worth, tx) when the anesthetized rabbits were placed supine on an
operative table. to prevent potential transfer of drug from eye to eye, the tonometer membrane was
cleaned with an  xxxd102xxx  after each eye measurement. pupil diameter was measured visually at
the point of the greatest horizontal diameter with a transparent millimeter ruler. successive triplicate
iop readings and pupil diameter measurements were made twice prior to drug administration ( one
before the first injection of microspheres and one after the injection). microsphere injection had no
influence on the iop and pupil diameter. iop and pupil diameter measurements were made at 30 and
60 min post treatment. all measurements were made under identical ambient lighting conditions.
measurement of the short-circuit current (isc) and potential difference

across

the isolated rabbit

icb

albino rabbits (2-3 kg) of either sex were sacrificed and the eyes were immediately enucleated.
the icb was mounted between two lucite chambers by the procedures described by burstein et al
(10). the fluid in two chambers was allowed to communicate through three banana-shaped apertures,
the total area of which was 0.32 cm each side of the chamber was filled with 10 ml of bathing
solution which was continuously bubbled with a 95% o2 : 5% co2 gas mixture to give a ph of 7.5.
the bathing solution used was a modified tyrode's solution with the following compositions (mm):
nacl, 103; kc1, 4; mgcl2, 1.2; cacl2, 1.8; nahcû3, 30; nah2p04, 0.8 and d-glucose 5.6. the ph
was adjusted to 7.5 with the gas mixture. the temperature of the bathing solution in the chamber was
maintained at 37°c.
throughout the experiment, the icbs were kept short-circuited using an automatic voltage
clamp apparatus, except for a few seconds every 10 min during which the electrical resistance and
potential difference were determined. the resistance was calculated by measuring the amount of
current necessary to offset the potential difference by 1 mv. the resistance of the solution was not
compensated for during short-circuiting.  xxxd164xxx  was added at the end of the experiments.
the large change in the isc was taken as an indication of the viability of the icb.

analysis of data
the data are presented as the mean ± s.e.m. a paired student's t- test was used to determine
the statistical significance of differences between the mean control values and the mean post
treatment values in the same group. for the differences between groups, a grouped student's t-test
was

used.

results

effect of  xxxd2500xxx  on the uveal blood flow
the normal blood flow to the iris, ciliary body and choroid is summarized in table. 1. as
expected, no significant difference was found in the baseline regional blood flow between the right
and left eyes. more than 70% of the uveal blood flow was in the choroid. the iris accounted for
about 4% and the ciliary body about 24%. as seen in fig.l, blood flow to the iris and ciliary body
was not significantly changed 1 hr after topical application of saline. unilateral topical
administration of  xxxd2500xxx  did not change the blood flow to the iris significantly but produced a
large decrease in the blood flow to the ciliary body of the treated eye (62%) with no significant
change in the untreated eye. pretreatment with yohimbine, a specific adrenergic 0c2-antagonist, did
not completely prevent the decrease in the blood flow to the ciliary body of the treated eye. the
blood flow to the iris and ciliary body was unaffected by yohimbine alone. in addition, none of the

pretreatment,  xxxd2500xxx  caused the same decrease in both heart rate and systolic and diastolic arterial
blood pressure. yohimbine alone had no significant effect on the heart rate and blood pressure
(table 3 and 4).

the effect of  xxxd2500xxx  on isc and potential difference across the isolated rabbit icb was
examined. the average isc was 5.71 10.58 (j.a/cm and the potential difference was 0.5110.09 mv
(aqueous side negative). after the tissue was stabilized for about 1 hr and the isc was constant for at
least 10 min,  xxxd2500xxx  was added to either the blood or aqueous bathing solution in the
concentration range of 10" to 10 m. the changes in isc and potential difference after  xxxd2500xxx 
addition to either blood or aqueous side for 30 min were not statistically significant (table 5).
 xxxd164xxx  (10" m), a known ionophore and stimulator of active ionic transport in many
epithelial cells, produced a large increase in both isc and potential difference when added to the
aqueous side.  xxxd2500xxx  was added when the isc was constant for at least 10 min with amphotericin
b in the aqueous solution. it was seen that  xxxd2500xxx  had no effect on  xxxd164xxx - stimulated isc
and potential difference after addition to either side (table 6).

"

depends mainly on the number of microspheres in the organs tested and reference samples. to obtain
blood flow values within 10% of the true value, one must have about 400 spheres in the sample (14).
in the present study, about 500,000 microspheres were injected for each measurement. cardiac
assume that the anesthetized rabbits have a cardiac output of about
cardiac
ml/min/kg (15),
output for the rabbits in the present study would be 325
ml/min. this would give 1.54 microspheres per ul/min of blood flow. based on this estimation and
the measured blood flow data in table 1, the number of spheres in the ocular tissue samples can be
calculated as follow: iris, 72; ciliary body, 485 and choroid, 1432. thus, for the iris with a small
number of spheres, large errors could be present. therefore, the microsphere method may be limiting

in interpreting significant differences in blood flow to the iris. in contrast, the number of spheres in
the ciliary body and choroid is substantial enough to demonstrate the significance of small changes
in blood flow to these tissues. as seen in table 1, the blood flow measurements in the right and left
eyes in this study were quite similar and consistent with another report in the literature (11).
unilateral topical application of  xxxd2500xxx  significantly decreased blood flow to the ciliary
body of the treated eye with no evident decrease in the contralateral untreated eye. this finding
further confirmed the earlier reports that adrenergic agonists produced a significant reduction in the
anterior uveal blood flow after topical administration (13, 16-18). however, mixed ai- and cc2adrenergic agonists were used in these studies, the receptor subtypes that mediated the reduction in
the ocular blood flow were not clear. in a recent study, norepinephrine (i.v.) increased systemic
blood pressure and decreased long posterior ciliary artery (lpca) blood flow. these responses were
suppressed only slightly by yohimbine, but were inhibited markedly by  xxxd3000xxx . b- ht-920 (i.v), a
selective a2-agonist, increased systemic blood pressure and decreased lpca blood flow. these
effects were antagonized by yohimbine (19). such observations suggest that a2-adrenoceptors do
exist in the ocular vasculafure; however, they appear to play a much less significant role than do
cci-adrenoceptors in controlling ocular vascular tone. the interpretation of the finding that
yohimbine did not completely prevent the reduction in the blood flow to the ciliary body of the
 xxxd2500xxx -treated eye in the current study could be that the concentration of yohimbine used was not
high enough to antagonize the actions of  xxxd2500xxx  at a2-receptors. however, the observation that
yohimbine, at the same concentration, markedly suppressed the iop lowering effects of  xxxd2500xxx  in
both eyes does not support this explanation. alternatively,  xxxd2500xxx  could have decreased the blood
flow to the ciliary body by an (x2-receptor subtype which was not antagonized by yohimbine or by

an ai- receptor. this latter interpretation is supported by the observation that a significant mydriasis
occurred only in the treated eye and was not blocked by yohimbine. since mydriasis is generally
believed to be a pure ai-adrenergic mechanism in rabbits, the observed decrease in the blood flow to
the ciliary body and the increase in the pupil diameter in the treated eye could have resulted from
residual ai-adrenoceptor stimulation by  xxxd2500xxx .
the relationship of the reduced ocular blood flow to the lowered iop is unclear. topical
epinephrine administration caused a reduction in both iop and the blood flow to the iris and ciliary
body in the treated eye of monkeys (18). however, it was found that the changes in the iop and
blood flow to the iris and ciliary processes induced by epinephrine did not follow the same time
pattern in the treated eye of rabbits. in the current experiment, the iop of both eyes was reduced by
 xxxd2500xxx , consistent with previous report (2), whereas the blood flow to the ciliary body was
reduced only in the treated eye. therefore, it seems unlikely that  xxxd2500xxx  lowered iop by
decreasing blood flow. systemic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly reduced by topical
 xxxd2500xxx  administration, which was propably mediated by a central mechanism (20). reduction in
the systemic arterial blood pressure could contribute to the iop lowering effects. however, the
observation that pretreatment with yohimbine markedly suppressed the iop lowering effect of
 xxxd2500xxx  with no effect on the  xxxd2500xxx -induced hypotension does not support this hypothesis.
the ocular hypotensive effect of  xxxd2500xxx  was blocked by yohimbine. this was similar to the report
that yohimbine considerably diminished bh-920 induced iop lowering effects in conscious rabbits
(21) and indicated that  xxxd2500xxx  lowered iop through cc2-receptors. however, other receptor
subtypes could not be excluded in this ocular hypotensive response.
the isolated rabbit icb has been widely used to study the effect of pharmacological agents on
aqueous humor formation (10, 22- 25). these studies confirmed the presence of an adenylate cyclase
in the ciliary epithelium and the involvement of camp in the regulation of ion transport by
adrenergic agents. however, there have been no reports about the effects of (x2- agonists on the isc
across the isolated rabbit icb. in the present study,  xxxd2500xxx  was found to have no significant effect
on either basal or  xxxd164xxx -stimulated transepithelial isc or potential difference. this does not
rule out, however, that  xxxd2500xxx  may alter ion transport across the icb. as pointed out by krupin et
al (22), the measured potential difference and isc of the icb are the result of the algebraic
contribution of several possible ion pumps located in the various cell membranes of this complex
epithelium.  xxxd2500xxx  might have produced a change in ion transport but the net effect was
-

30

electrically silent, or it could have effects on neutral ion exchangers, e.g. na /h exchange.
 xxxd164xxx  increases the apical membrane permeability to ions and makes the operation of the
pump on the basolateral membrane more efficient (26). thus, in the icb preparation,  xxxd164xxx 
stimulates or inhibits the isc when added to the aqueous or blood side bathing solution respectively.
in the present study,  xxxd164xxx   xxxd1891xxx " m produced a large increase in isc when added to the
aqueous side. this was as expected and representative of a viabile icb preparation.
in summary, the present study demonstrates that topically ocular unilateral administration of
 xxxd2500xxx  to anesthetized rabbits decreased the blood flow to the ciliary body of the treated eye
significantly. the systemic arterial blood pressure and heart rate were also reduced. pretreatment
with yohimbine could not prevent these actions. the iop of both eyes was lowered following
 xxxd2500xxx  treatment and yohimbine blocked this iop lowering effect. in the isolated rabbit icb
preparation,  xxxd2500xxx  had no significant effect on either basal or  xxxd164xxx - stimulated
transepithelial isc and potential difference. these observations suggest that the iop lowering effect
of  xxxd2500xxx  was mediated by ct2-receptors and that the reduction in the blood flow to the ciliary
