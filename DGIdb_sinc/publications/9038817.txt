expression of the sodium-chloride cotransporter in osteoblast-like cells: effect of thiazide diuretics.  the use of thiazide diuretics is associated with increased bone mineral density and, in some studies with reduced incidence of fractures, suggesting a potential role for these drugs in the treatment of osteoporosis. our objective was to examine the effects of thiazides on osteoblast-like cells using the rat umr-106 osteosarcoma cell line. treatment of umr-106 cells with chlorothiazide caused membrane depolarization and a rise of intracellular calcium but had no effect on adenosine 3,5'-cyclic monophosphate accumulation. the rise of intracellular calcium was partially inhibited by nifedipine and removal of extracellular calcium, indicating calcium uptake from the extracellular media, as well as by thapsigargin or dantrolene, indicating contributions from calcium release from intracellular stores. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was used to isolate a partial cdna clone for the  xxxg2080xxx  from umr-106 cells that hybridized to 5.0- and 11.0-kilobase mrnas when northern blot analysis was conducted. antisense oligonucleotides to the sodium-chloride cotransporter specifically inhibited the chlorothiazide-induced depolarization and rise of intracellular calcium and reduced immunofluorescence staining for the sodium-chloride cotransporter protein in umr-106 cells. we conclude that thiazide diuretics inhibit sodium-chloride cotransporter activity in umr-106 cells, thereby altering intracellular calcium regulation. these results provide evidence for direct effects of thiazide diuretics on bone cells.
