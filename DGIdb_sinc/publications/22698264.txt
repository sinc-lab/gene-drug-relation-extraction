introduction: many opioid analgesics share common structural elements;
however, minor differences in structure can result in major differences in
pharmacological activity, pharmacokinetic profile, and clinical efficacy and
tolerability.
areas covered: this review compares and contrasts the chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and cns ‘functional activity’ of  xxxd3289xxx  and
tramadol, responsible for their individual clinical utilities.
expert opinion: the distinct properties of  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol generate
different cns functional activities, making each drug the prototype of different
classes of opioid/nonopioid analgesics. tramadol’s analgesia derives from relatively weak µ-opioid receptor (mor) agonism, plus norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition, provided collectively by the enantiomers of the parent
drug and a metabolite that is a stronger mor agonist, but has lower cns penetration.  xxxd3289xxx ’s mor agonist activity is several-fold greater than tramadol’s,
with prominent norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and minimal serotonin
effect. accordingly, tramadol is well-suited for pain conditions for which a strong
opioid component is not needed----and it has the benefit of a low abuse potential;
whereas  xxxd3289xxx , a schedule-ii controlled substance, is well-suited for pain
conditions requiring a strong opioid component----and it has the benefit of
greater gastrointestinal tolerability compared to classical strong opioids. both
drugs offer distinct and complementary clinical options.

introduction

in the history of medicinal chemistry and pharmacology in drug discovery, chemists
have created a variety of ways to describe a chemical structure and to characterize its
relevant feature, and pharmacologists have created a variety of ways to describe differences in drug potency, affinity and intrinsic activity at receptor sites, and efficacy [1].
both histories have converged on the recognition of the critical importance of discriminating drugs based on ‘functional activity,’ rather than on superficial similarities
in chemical structure or in vitro assays.
the late writer and chemist primo levi complained in 1984 that there were only
three acceptable ways to describe a molecule and that none of them were very good:
i) the ambiguous molecular formula, ii) the nonlexical chemical graph, and iii) the
(often obscure) chemical name [2]. yet, because these were the only ways that chemists
had at the time to describe a molecule’s ‘constitution,’ they dominated the approaches
to predicting what a molecule would do. these approaches were based on the 2d

 xxxd3289xxx  has an open-chain structure in the place of
tramadol’s cyclic structure, resulting in distinct chemical
and biological properties.
both drugs combine, in different ways, opioid and
nonopioid activities that act synergistically to produce
analgesia. as they do so in mechanistically distinct ways,
the resulting clinical attributes are different.
 xxxd3289xxx , in a single molecule, combines relatively
strong µ-opioid receptor agonism and norepinephrine
reuptake inhibition, but has no relevant functional
serotonin reuptake inhibition and no analgesicallyactive metabolite. the two enantiomers of tramadol
contribute to different mechanisms (i.e., weak
µ-opioid receptor agonism, as well as neuronal
norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition); an
analgesically active µ-opioid metabolite contributes to an
extent dependent on dose and adme factors.
with much greater potency at the µ-opioid receptor
compared to tramadol,  xxxd3289xxx  has a cns functional
opioid activity several-fold greater than tramadol’s; its
norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is the same or a little
greater than tramadol’s; and its serotonin activity is
much reduced compared to that of tramadol.
 xxxd3289xxx  mainly undergoes phase ii metabolism
(glucuronidation), whereas tramadol primarily undergoes
phase i (cyp2d6 and cyp3a4) metabolism.
 xxxd3289xxx ’s opioid and norepinephrinergic activities are
both present in the parent molecule; tramadol´s opioid
activity is mainly expressed in its primary metabolite,
whereas its monoaminergic activity is primarily present
in its parent molecule.
 xxxd3289xxx ’s greater functional µ-opioid activity gives
rise to potency and efficacy comparable to strong
opioids; tramadol is widely used for multiple pain types
where a strong opioid component is not needed
or desired.
 xxxd3289xxx  is a controlled substance with reduced
gastrointestinal adverse effects compared to classical
strong opioids; tramadol has a history of long-term use
and low abuse potential.
due to its unique features, it has been proposed that
 xxxd3289xxx  belongs to a new pharmacological class,
mor-nri.

this box summarizes key points contained in the article.

(two-dimensional) structural formula, only indicating stereochemistry with stereochemical descriptors. it is now known
that this presentation of a chemical structure is an
oversimplification that only focuses on the connectivity and
binding mode of the atoms and, to some extent, their spatial
arrangement. at the time, this was necessary for printed
materials, but modern computers now allow greater flexibility
to visualize ‘lock-and-key fit’ and the importance of 3d
(three-dimensional) visualization of structure. to illustrate the
limitations and potential pitfalls of the now archaic approach
of comparing the 2d carbon skeleton (i.e., taking only the
ring systems and the linkers connecting the ring systems into
consideration [3]), tramadol would be erroneously compared to
1438

the nsaid (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug)  xxxd1882xxx ,
because both drugs have the same generalized carbon scaffold
(wherein two ring systems are connected without a spacer
group). based on this type of chemotypic analysis, as described
by hu et al. [4], tramadol and  xxxd1882xxx  should act by common
pharmacological mechanisms, which of course they do not.
even smiles (simplified molecular input line entry specification) [5], which was developed by david weininger shortly after
levi’s lament and intended to be a real lexicographic description,
only facilitated methods that relied on the counting of elements of
composition, chemical rules of thumb, classification algorithms,
drug-like filters (e.g., the ubiquitous ‘rule of five’ [6]), 2d
qsar (quantitative structure--activity relationship) or molecular
fingerprints. whereas chemists may have elaborated beyond
the elemental to include graph-related properties (such as
aromaticity, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, hydrogen bond
donors and acceptors, etc.), these are seldom fundamental and
are often simply opinions on how molecules behave [1]. it is
now universally recognized that the different types of interactions
between molecules and a biological target strongly depend on the
spatial arrangement of molecular fragments within the target
macromolecule [7]. thus 3d shape must be considered in order
to predict essential aspects of the pharmacological activity
of a molecule.
therefore in the first section of this review, we describe
how the 3d shape of  xxxd3289xxx  was rationally designed to
produce a new compound having distinct pharmacodynamic
and pharmacokinetic properties in order to achieve specific
clinical goals.
similar to the historical development of approaches to best
(most fully) describe the chemical attributes of drugs, there
has been equivalent development of approaches to best
describe the pharmacological attributes of drugs. one of the
earliest, because of its simplicity, was to use ‘potency’ (the
amount of a drug required to produce a defined level of
effect), typically reported as an ed" where " is a specified level
of effect. the limitations of such a measure are readily apparent, since such a measure is highly dependent on factors
unrelated to the drug’s mechanism of action. a clear example
is loperamide, which is mechanistically a strong opioid, but is
devoid of cns (central nervous system) effects when
administered orally, because it does not cross the blood--brain
barrier. a more mechanistic measure of a drug’s pharmacological attributes was devised and termed ‘affinity’ (the
strength of attraction between a drug and its target) and is
typically reported as a ki value (for a review of the historical
development of this concept [8]). such a measure, however,
does not account for the result of the binding, since antagonists have affinity for the drug’s target site, but do not produce
the effect. therefore, in order to describe target activation,
measures such as ‘intrinsic activity’ or ‘intrinsic efficacy’ at
the target site (receptor) were introduced. the most comprehensive comparison of two drugs utilizes a composite of all of
these measures as manifested in each drug’s ‘functional
activity’ (defined as the ratio of the estimated brain

concentration to the relevant functional ec50 or ki value at a
specified receptor or transporter site) in the desired therapeutic application----in this case, antinociception (in animals) or
analgesia (in humans).
therefore in the second section of this review, we describe
how the differences in the cns functional activity of  xxxd3289xxx 
and tramadol (based on the differences in their pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and functional activity characteristics)
correlate with their clinical features and common uses. escalating
the dose of tramadol in an effort to match  xxxd3289xxx ’s
greater opioid activity is not a clinically feasible option because
disproportionally more of the weaker opioid parent drug
crosses the blood--brain barrier than does its stronger opioid
metabolite (o-desmethyl tramadol). in fact, in the same models,
the disparity gets progressively larger as the dose of tramadol is
increased [9].
the significantly different pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and cns functional activities of  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol
are consistent with, and provide the basis for understanding, the
different clinical profiles of these two centrally acting analgesics.

chemical differentiation of  xxxd3289xxx 
from tramadol

2.

based on elucidation of the favorable aspects of the multimodal analgesic mechanism of action of racemic cyclohexyl
analgesics (of which tramadol was one representative), a research
program was initiated to design a new class of opioid/nonopioid
analgesics that would combine mor (µ-opioid receptor) agonism and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, with minimal
serotonergic activity. it was also desired that both activities would
reside in a single parent molecule that does not require metabolic
activation via the cytochrome p450 system.
the discovery of  xxxd3289xxx 
the 3d molecular shape of  xxxd3289xxx  is very different from
that of tramadol, which manifests itself in the different pharmacological profiles of the two analgesics. in the following sections,
these differences are described in more detail, including the
chemical distinction between the cyclic structure of tramadol
and the open-chain structure of  xxxd3289xxx  (figure 1), resulting
in reduced molecular complexity and a stronger cns functional
activity that is primarily derived from its two intrinsically
synergistic mechanisms of analgesic action.
2.1

the dimethylaminomethyl fragment
the dimethylaminomethyl moiety is a significant part of the
pharmacophore that is needed for interaction with mor
and interaction with the  xxxg2099xxx  system [10].
demethylation is a metabolic pathway leading to ch2-nh
(ch3) and ch2nh2 derivatives that lack significant analgesic
activity [11,12]. increasing the size of the nitrogen substituent
or cyclic substitution also leads to inactive compounds. the
dimethylaminomethyl fragment, therefore, appears to be
essential for analgesic activity for both drugs.
2.2

the role of relative stereochemistry
tramadol and  xxxd3289xxx  contain two chiral carbon atoms.
consequently, for both molecules, four stereoisomers exist as
two diasteromeric pairs of enantiomers. however, tramadol is
a racemate, whereas  xxxd3289xxx  is a pure enantiomer. the
relative stereochemistry is critical for biological activity. in both
cases, only the (r,r) and (s,s) isomers display analgesic
activity, whereas the diastereoisomers are relatively inactive.
the stereochemical requirements and dimethylaminomethyl
fragment are the only common relationships between  xxxd3289xxx 
[(--)-(1r,2r)-3-(3-dimethylamino-1-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)phenol hydrochloride] and tramadol [(1rs,2rs)-2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-1-(3-methoxyphenyl) xxxd1776xxx ]
hydrochloride.
2.3

cyclic core structure versus open-chain molecule
several drugs possess cyclic aliphatic ring systems connected via linkers with other aromatic or hetero aromatic
groups [13]. however, in the lead optimization phase, a
cyclic ring system is typically modified by changing the
ring size and introducing hetero atoms (such as nitrogen,
oxygen, or sulfur) as well as introducing additional
substituents in order to optimize desired hydrophobic or
non-hydrophobic interactions with the biological target,
thereby leading to an increase in the potency of a given
lead structure. as a consequence, the cyclic structure is
retained in many lead optimization programs due to the
entropic and enthalpic balance of the thermodynamics of
binding [14,15]. cyclic structures generally have the advantage of decreasing the entropic proportion of the binding
energy compared with open-chain molecules, leading to
more flexible derivatives with greater ligand efficiency [16].
additionally, many examples are known wherein an openchain analog of a given drug loses biological activity
completely; for instance, the open-chain analog of diazepam is completely inactive [17]. in the course of the
development of  xxxd3289xxx , it was found that opening
the cyclohexane ring system led to active compounds
while conserving the relative stereochemistry. however,
the activity of the molecules was strongly dependent on
the length of the side chain. it was found that a methyl
group and an ethyl group at critical carbon atoms were
optimal in the general formula. the preference of the pentyl chain in  xxxd3289xxx  compared with analogs containing
the hexyl chain (comparable to the cyclohexane core ring
of tramadol) was not predictable by any in silico tool available at the time and can still not be explained by usual
structure--activity relationships.

2.5

the introduction of a phenolic hydroxy group instead of an
aromatic methoxy group results in a dramatic change in pharmacological activity [10]. whereas tramadol is a racemate with

that is generated following cytochrome p450 (cyp2d6)mediated o-demethylation,  xxxd3289xxx  does not have analgesically active metabolites (i.e., both of its mechanisms of
action reside within the parent molecule).
the enantiomers of open-chain phenolic structures showed
increased analgesic activity compared to the cyclic tramadolderived analogs. consequently, the enantiomers were investigated
separately in the optimization process described below.
racemate versus pure enantiomer
in past decades, the pharmacopoeia was dominated by racemates [18]; however, since the emergence in the 1980s of
new technologies that allowed the preparation of pure enantiomers in significant quantities, the awareness and interest
in the stereochemistry of drug action has increased. the
advances in stereoselective bioanalysis led to new awareness
of the importance of stereoselective pharmacodynamics and
pharmacokinetics, enabling the differentiation of the relative
contributions of enantiomers to overall drug action. these
factors have led to an increasing preference for selection of
single enantiomers by both the pharmaceutical industry and
regulatory authorities. enantiomeric purity is now a primary
objective in the design, discovery, development, launching,
and marketing of new drugs [19].
as a consequence of this changing climate toward
drug chirality, pure enantiomers were used for further optimization. subsequently, it was found that the mor affinity of
the enantiomer acting on the norepinephrine transporter
was increased, and in the following steps, modifications
were made to increase this mor affinity.
2.6

replacement of the aliphatic hydroxyl group
it is known for many drugs that their aliphatic hydroxyl
group is essential for pharmacological activity [20].
2.7

1440

derivatization by introducing ester or ether groups in this
position led to the loss of analgesic activity. however,
replacement of the tertiary hydroxyl group by either fluorine or hydrogen resulted in a significant increase of
mor affinity for both enantiomers. the fluorine derivatives were not further developed due to physicochemical
stability issues. critically, the hydrogen derivative was
found to have both activities in one molecule. while retaining the norepinephrine reuptake inhibition (nri) component, the mor agonism component was increased to
achieve potent analgesic activity without the prominent
serotonin reuptake inhibition (sri) effect present in tramadol. chemical innovations introduced in the development
of  xxxd3289xxx  are summarized in figure 2.
 xxxd3289xxx  as a rationally designed
polypharmacological ligand

2.8

increasing evidence demonstrates that many pharmaceutically
important compounds elicit their effects through binding to
multiple targets. this so-called ‘directed polypharmacology’ is
impacting conventional drug discovery and rational drug
design strategies [21]. the single-target focus traditionally dominated compound optimization efforts, and a high degree of
target specificity was typically considered a desirable goal of
drug candidates. systems biology, however, has revealed
networked physiological systems with convergent, divergent,
and integrated signaling pathways that involve extensive
crosstalk among these pathways. the reduction of drug
discovery to a single target is now seen to be a gross oversimplification that unduly minimizes the complexity of the
pathophysiology [22]. drug programs that assume a single-target
mechanism, particularly for the cns, can have extremely low
success rates, with early hits often leading to costly failures at

the clinical stage. furthermore, such drugs can produce excess
adverse effects because of the high doses needed by singlemechanism agents. in many cases, the adverse effects contribute
to a termination of drug intake, sometimes resulting in disease
relapse, and major problems such as chronic pain remain
unsolved [23]. in recent years, it has been increasingly appreciated that multi-pathophysiological medical conditions are
most likely best treated by complementary multi-modal mechanisms of action. hence, polypharmacology is beginning to be
regarded as a general drug discovery principle----the so-called
concept of designed multiple ligands----that influences
compound design, optimization, and evaluation [24,25].

pharmacological differentiation of
 xxxd3289xxx  from tramadol

3.

the pronounced 3d differences in chemical structure of tramadol and  xxxd3289xxx  translate into a number of substantial
functional differences.

differences in opioid receptor binding affinity
and functional activity

3.1

as shown in table 1,  xxxd3289xxx  binds to recombinantlyexpressed human mor (hmor) with an affinity (ki value)
of 0.16 µm [26]. for tramadol, its enantiomers, or its m1
(o-desmethyl) metabolite and enantiomers, a range of values
has been reported [27,28]. from the most recent, the parent form
of tramadol exhibits low hmor affinity with a ki value of
2.4 µm, whereas its (+)m1 metabolite exhibits much higher
affinity with a ki of 0.0034 µm [28]. thus, the parent form of
tramadol exhibits about 15-fold lower affinity for hmor than
does  xxxd3289xxx  and about 700-fold lower affinity than its
(+) m1 metabolite. in comparison,  xxxd3289xxx  binds with nearly
50-fold lower affinity for hmor than does the (+)m1 metabolite
of tramadol. however, these binding numbers may underestimate the pharmacological strength of the interaction, as shown
below when one measures functional activity.
in contrast to its lower binding affinity, the functional
activity of  xxxd3289xxx  in the agonist-stimulated [35s]gtpgs
binding assay in cells recombinantly expressing hmor is similar

to that of the higher-affinity (+)m1 metabolite of tramadol
(tramadol parent displays no detectable functional activity)
(table 1) [26,28]. this highlights the importance of comparing
drugs based on their functional activity rather than on an indirect
measure such as binding affinity (which does not take into
account intrinsic activity, target access, etc.). just as a superficial
similarity in 2d chemical structure is an unreliable indicator
and underestimates the differences between the biological effects
of  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol, so too does a comparison based on
in vitro binding affinity alone.
differences in net and sert binding affinity and
functional activity in vitro

3.2

regarding interactions with the monoaminergic transporters
net and sert,  xxxd3289xxx  binds to human net (hnet)
and sert ( xxxg2150xxx ) with ki values of 8.8 [26] and 5.28 µm,
respectively, whereas the tramadol parent binds to these targets
with ki values of 14.6 and 1.19 µm, respectively (hertrampf &
englberger, unpublished observations) (table 1).
in terms of the functional inhibition of these targets,  xxxd3289xxx  blocks norepinephrine uptake by hnet with a ki value of
0.75 µm and serotonin uptake by rat sert (data not available
for the human ortholog) with a ki value of 2.37 µm. in comparison, (--)-tramadol blocks the function of the hnet with a ki
value of 1.08 µm, and (+)-tramadol blocks rsert with a ki
value of 0.53 µm, respectively (table 1). both tramadol
m1 metabolite enantiomers are less potent at these transporters
and achieve lower brain concentrations (see below) compared
with their respective parents, thereby limiting their functional
contributions to these mechanisms. thus,  xxxd3289xxx  is slightly
more potent than tramadol in blocking hnet and nearly
fivefold less potent than tramadol in blocking rsert.
again, the above mechanistically insightful results highlight
the importance of comparing drugs based on their functional
activity rather than on binding affinity or other indirect
measures. only the former provides the added dimension
1442

that elucidates the true nature and extent of the individual
properties of two drugs, and hence of their differences.
in summary, the in vitro receptor binding and in vitro
functional assays demonstrate that  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol
(including its m1 metabolite) are substantially different with
respect to their mor agonism, serotonin reuptake inhibition
( xxxd3289xxx  greater at the former and lesser at the latter compared
with tramadol) and in the resulting in vivo effects. as discussed in
the following sections, the differences are magnified in vivo,
because of two factors: i) differences in functional activity
in vivo, and ii) because of limited distribution of tramadol (+)
m1 to the brain.
differences in monoaminergic functional
activity in vivo

3.3

the in vivo differences in net and sert profiles of  xxxd3289xxx 
and tramadol become evident in microdialysis measurements in
the ventral hippocampus in the rat. as shown in figure 3, in this
assay, tramadol produces large dose-dependent increases in both
norepinephrine (about fivefold of baseline) and serotonin (about
five- to sixfold of baseline) within its analgesic dose range [29]. in
contrast,  xxxd3289xxx  produces a similarly large dose-dependent
increase in extracellular norepinephrine levels (about five- to sixfold of baseline), but much lower increase in extracellular serotonin levels compared to tramadol (about twofold of baseline)
within its analgesic dose range [26].
differences in analgesic efficacy and the impact
of metabolism

3.4

the substantial potency difference between  xxxd3289xxx  and
tramadol was first established in animal models of pain.
across a variety of assays,  xxxd3289xxx  is consistently two to
five times more potent than tramadol (e.g., ed50 value of
2.2 and 9.6 mg/kg i.v., respectively, in the rat tail flick test
and ed50 values of 1.65 and 3.5 mg/kg i.v., respectively, in
the rat spinal nerve ligation [snl] model). this potency

tramadol data reprinted from [29] with permission from elsevier.
 xxxd3289xxx  data adapted from [26].

difference cannot be explained by the in vitro potency data
alone (see above for details), because the ec50 of (+)m1 at
mor (0.86 µm) is similar to that of  xxxd3289xxx  (0.67 µm),
and the ki of  xxxd3289xxx  inhibition of hnet (0.75 µm) is
similar to that of tramadol (1.08 µm).
to further analyze functional analgesic activity, we determined
the ‘cns activity’ (defined as the ratio of the estimated brain
concentration in humans divided by the relevant functional
ec50 or ki value at the receptor or monoaminergic transporter)
of  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol plus its active metabolite m1. specifically, we calculated the relative ratio of the human plasma
steady-state cmax and cavg (auc/t) values for  xxxd3289xxx 
(100 mg every 4 h) and tramadol (200 mg b.i.d.) at steady state
to the ec50 (mor) or ki (net and sert). for  xxxd3289xxx ,
cmax = 145 ng/ml and auc = 3,071 ng x h/ml
(terlinden et al., unpublished observations). for (+)tramadol,
cmax = 323 ng/ml (1.2 µm) and auc = 2,784 ng x h/ml
(cavg = 0.4 µm), and for (--)tramadol, cmax = 290 ng/ml
(1.1 µm) and auc = 2,227 ng x h/ml (cavg = 0.4 µm) [30].
for (+)m1, cmax = 61 ng/ml and auc = 697 ng x h/ml, and
for (--)m1, cmax = 81 ng/ml and auc = 761 ng x h/ml [30].
for mor, the ec50 values for  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol (+)

m1 were based on agonist-stimulated [35s]gtpgs binding assay
in cells recombinantly expressing human mor. for net, the ki
values were based on human functional transporter assays for
 xxxd3289xxx  and (--)tramadol. for sert, the ki values were based
on rat functional transporter assays for  xxxd3289xxx  and (+)tramadol. the potency of  xxxd3289xxx  measured in the rat functional
net assay (0.5 µm) is about the same as that in the human
(0.7 µm); we assume that the same approximation is true for
rat and human sert. notwithstanding differences in brain penetration as a function of dose, we also assumed that the plasma
concentrations of (+) and (--)tramadol, tramadol (+) and (--)
m1 and  xxxd3289xxx  represent a reasonable estimate of extracellular fluid or brain concentrations, based on microdialysis studies
(beier, terlinden et al., unpublished observations) [9]. thus, the
ratio of brain cmax of  xxxd3289xxx  to the ec50 at mor
(0.71 µm/0.67 µm = 1.06) is much larger than the ratio for tramadol (+)m1 (0.24 µm/0.86 µm = 0.28), thus leading to a
much greater µ-opioid effect than tramadol (+)m1. similar calculations of the ratio of brain cmax to the functional ki for
net and sert revealed approximately similar activity of  xxxd3289xxx  and the more nri-selective (--)-enantiomer of tramadol at
the net and negligible activity of  xxxd3289xxx  at the sert. this

fundamental distinction and differentiation between the two
drugs is illustrated in figure 4.
the ‘cns activity’ ratios of  xxxd3289xxx  are about the same
whether calculated using cmax or cavg in contrast to tramadol
(figure 4a vs 4b). in either case, the cns opioid activity of
 xxxd3289xxx  is much greater than that of tramadol (3.73- to
6.91-fold). the contribution of net inhibition is the same or
even greater for  xxxd3289xxx  than for tramadol (0.94- to
2.60-fold). but  xxxd3289xxx ’s sert inhibition is only about
10--25% that of tramadol’s, demonstrating the success of the
medicinal chemistry effort to reduce this activity in creating a
new drug.
differences in the contribution of nri and sri
activities to efficacy

3.5

the contribution of norepinephrinergic activity and the lack of
relevant serotonergic activity of  xxxd3289xxx  were confirmed in a
number of animal pain models. for example, schr€oder et al.
(2010) showed that the dose--response curve for the antinociceptive effect of  xxxd3289xxx  in a low-intensity tail flick model
and for the antihypersensitive effect in a snl model was shifted
to the right by the a2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine
(increase of the ed50 value by 1.7-fold in the acute nociceptive
pain model and by 4.7-fold in the chronic neuropathic pain
model), but not by the  xxxg1113xxx  antagonist ritanserin [31]. an antagonism of the  xxxd3289xxx  effect by yohimbine
and a lack of antagonism by ritanserin has also been observed in
the cfa (complete freund’s adjuvant)-induced hyperalgesia
model of chronic inflammatory pain [32]. in contrast, both
the norepinephrinergic and serotonergic mechanisms have
been demonstrated to contribute to the analgesic efficacy of tramadol. the antihypersensitive effect of tramadol in the snl
(spinal nerve ligation) model is reduced by both yohimbine
and ritanserin (christoph et al., unpublished observations).
raffa et al. (1992) have also shown that the antinociceptive
effect of intrathecal tramadol in a tail-flick model is blocked
by both yohimbine and ritanserin [33].
differences in source of synergy
a recent study has demonstrated that the two mechanisms of
action of  xxxd3289xxx  show a very pronounced intrinsic synergy
with respect to antinociceptive activity in a low-intensity
tail-flick test in the rat [34]. in that study, indirect evidence
was also obtained for an intrinsic antihypersensitive synergy
in a snl model. to our knowledge, this was the first
demonstration of two mechanisms of action (mor agonism
and nri) within one molecule interacting to produce a
synergistic effect.
synergistic interaction between the two enantiomers of
tramadol has been reported in some pain models. because
the opioid, norepinephrinergic, and serotonergic activity of
tramadol reside mainly in the (+)m1 metabolite, (--)tramadol
enantiomer, and (+)tramadol enantiomer, respectively, tramadol can be interpreted as a combination of three molecules,
each with different pharmacological and pharmacokinetic
3.6

1444

properties. the fortuitous combination of these molecules
leads to beneficial clinical attributes of the drug.

metabolic differentiation of  xxxd3289xxx 
from tramadol

4.

with respect to its opioid component, tramadol must undergo
hepatic metabolism to (+)m1 in order to achieve significant
binding affinity at mor. this metabolism is via the cytochrome
p450 system, predominantly cyp2d6, but also cyp3a4 [35].
these enzymes show a pronounced genetic polymorphism. it is
thus possible that standard doses of tramadol do not always yield
satisfactory analgesia in cyp2d6 polymorphic patients [36].
furthermore, many drugs are metabolized by this same enzyme
system. thus, drug--drug interactions might occur in cases of
co-medication with other drugs that are metabolized by, or
inhibit, this enzyme [37].
in the case of  xxxd3289xxx , both mechanisms of action
(mor agonism and nri) reside within the parent molecule.
the metabolism of  xxxd3289xxx  is mainly via direct glucuronidation (phase ii metabolism) to the non-analgesic tapentadolo-glucuronide. glucuronidation is mediated via a number of
different isoforms of ugt ( xxxd3476xxx -glucuronyltransferase), mainly  xxxg2385xxx , ugt2b7, and  xxxg2383xxx 
(terlinden et al., unpublished observations). the expression of
these enzymes shows only relatively little natural variation, and
they have a high capacity and are not easily saturated [38]. thus,
the expected variability in effectiveness across a patient population
is smaller, and cyp p450-based drug--drug interactions are less
likely [39].
overall,  xxxd3289xxx  thus has a simpler pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic profile than does tramadol. moreover,
 xxxd3289xxx  does not have any active metabolites relevant for
its analgesic activity [38], avoiding variable response due to
genetic variability and in metabolism [40-42].
5.

clinical efficacy

in the clinical setting, an equianalgesic ratio of approximately
5:1 for long-acting formulations of  xxxd3289xxx  and oxycodone
has been estimated (based on individually adjusted dose) [43].
this translates to an approximate ratio of 1:1.5 to 1:4 for
 xxxd3289xxx  to tramadol, depending on conversion rates
between morphine and oxycodone, and between morphine
and tramadol, in the published literature [44-46]. this roughly
corresponds to the potency difference between  xxxd3289xxx 
and tramadol seen in a range of animal pain models (see above).
hence, even assuming a conservative conversion rate of
1:2 between  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol, based on the recommended maximum daily dose of 400 mg for longacting tramadol [47], this would be expected to achieve only
40% of the analgesic effect of a maximum daily dose of longacting  xxxd3289xxx  (500 mg) [48]. an intermediate daily dose
of 250 mg  xxxd3289xxx  would correspond to 500 mg tramadol,
which already exceeds the recommended tramadol daily dose.

 xxxd3289xxx  is a single molecule; tramadol is a racemate
 xxxd3289xxx  has no analgesically active metabolites; tramadol has an active metabolite
the main pathway of  xxxd3289xxx  metabolism is glucuronidation; tramadol is metabolized mainly via the cyp450 enzyme complex
 xxxd3289xxx  has substantially more cns functional activity at mor than does tramadol, about the same or more functional activity at
net, and substantially less functional activity at sert
the mechanisms of action of  xxxd3289xxx  reside in a single molecule; the mechanisms of action of tramadol reside in different
molecules (enantiomers of the parent and m1 metabolite)
 xxxd3289xxx  is two to five times more potent than tramadol across a range of animal pain models. likewise, clinically, tramadol is
most effective for treating pains not requiring a strong opioid, whereas  xxxd3289xxx  is effective in treating pain requiring the efficacy
level of strong opioids (e.g., oxycodone)
in clinical trials,  xxxd3289xxx  has been shown to have comparable efficacy to oxycodone with more favorable tolerability; in usual
practice, tramadol is not used for this level of pain
 xxxd3289xxx  is a schedule ii drug in the united states and scheduling is in place or anticipated for all major countries where it is
marketed, whereas tramadol is not scheduled in all major countries

cns: central nervous system; mor: µ-opioid receptor; net: norepinephrine (noradrenaline) transporter.

the efficacy of tramadol is often optimized by a ‘start low, go
slow’ approach and titration to the desired dose. however,
escalating the tramadol dose in an effort to achieve the same
opioid-effect as  xxxd3289xxx  is not a clinically viable option
because: i) the dose needed would likely exceed the recommended maximum, and ii) the ratio of the brain concentration
of m1 (which provides the major contribution to the opioid
activity of tramadol) to the brain concentration of parent
drug decreases as the oral tramadol dose is increased [9]. further
experience with a broader patient population is necessary to
come to a more definite conversion rate.
a more in-depth comparison of the clinical efficacy, safety,
and tolerability of  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol is beyond the scope
of this paper (which explicitly focuses on the chemical and

pharmacological features of the two drugs). the clinical features
of tramadol have been comprehensively covered in many
reviews [49-51], and there are also already some overviews of the features of  xxxd3289xxx  [52-54]. a direct comparison of both drugs may
also be inappropriate in the present context. as outlined above,
due to the different potency and efficacy, both drugs target largely
different pain intensities and thus different patient populations,
making a direct comparison of both drugs not feasible. in fact,
the expected higher efficacy of  xxxd3289xxx  has led to the decision
in early clinical development to use oxycodone (rather than
tramadol) as the reference comparator in clinical studies. thus,
the efficacy and tolerability profile of  xxxd3289xxx  has largely
been established based on the comparison with oxycodone, not
with tramadol [55].

conclusion

tramadol and  xxxd3289xxx  are mechanistically and therapeutically
distinct drugs although they share certain superficial chemical
structural similarities (for summary, see table 2). the pharmacological and functional differences that are observed in vitro and
in vivo translate into significant clinical differences. tramadol’s
somewhat complex, but fortuitous, combination of enantiomers
and activemetabolite, plus pharmacokinetic profile, provides
effective analgesia where a strong opioid component is not
needed [56], with a low frequency of abuse [57-59].  xxxd3289xxx ’s
combined synergistic mor agonism and nri within a single
molecule yields high and reliable analgesic efficacy for the treatment of pains comparable to oxycodone with more favorable
gastrointestinal tolerability [60-62]. the novel features of its mechanism of action has led several authors to suggest that  xxxd3289xxx 
should be considered in a new pharmacological class of drugs, the
mor-nri [63-66].
7.

expert opinion

the centrally acting analgesics  xxxd3289xxx  and tramadol are
chemically, pharmacologically, and metabolically distinct
drugs. these differences in pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties----and most importantly their cns functional activity----place them in separate classes of the category
of multi-mechanistic opioid/nonopioid analgesic drugs, and
result in unique and complementary options for use in different clinical situations.  xxxd3289xxx  has been suggested
to be a representative of a new class termed mor-nri.
clinical experience will determine whether this is a useful
categorization for physicians trying to select the best
analgesic match for a particular type of pain or for certain
populations of pain patients.
recent publications lament the lack of success of the translational research approach to drug discovery. this has been particularly true in the area of analgesic drug discovery, in which
an nce (new chemical entity) strong analgesic had not been
approved in the preceding 25 years.  xxxd3289xxx  demonstrates
how such a targeted strategy can lead to an innovative and
effective new drug.  xxxd3289xxx  was built upon advances in
the understanding of the basic science of pain and mechanisms
of analgesia----coupled with directed medicinal chemistry modifications----to yield a new drug whose designed properties offer
a differentiated clinical (‘bench-to-bedside’) profile.
tramadol, a centrally acting analgesic with an established
record of efficacy and safety, grew out of a discovery program
designed to identify novel opioid analgesics. however, the
complete picture of its mechanism of action was elucidated to
a great extent after-the-fact. its analgesic mechanisms do not
reside in a single molecule, but instead in a fortuitously balanced combination of parent and metabolite molecules and
each of their enantiomers. in contrast to this serendipitous
combination of mechanisms,  xxxd3289xxx  was custom-designed
to rationally combine two analgesic mechanisms (mor
1446

agonism and nri) that individually and synergistically produce analgesia in models of various types of pain----within a single molecule. as part of this development,  xxxd3289xxx  was
designed to have less serotonergic activity. the result is an
innovative drug that retains the advantages of combining synergistic mechanisms of action, but with a significantly greater
‘functional’ opioid component and a relatively greater inhibition of the net than of the sert, all in a single molecule
with no analgesically active metabolites. the focus on norepinephrinergic activity and the lack of relevant serotonergic activity takes into account the recent recognition that the role of
serotonin in the context of pain therapy is ambivalent. while,
on the one hand, serotonin functions, besides ne, as a transmitter in the descending pain inhibitory system, in contrast
to ne, serotonin is also a transmitter in descending excitatory
projections. thus, in contrast to ne, serotonin not only has
an anti-nociceptive effect, but can also have a pro-nociceptive
effect [67,68], questioning the value of this mechanism for
profound analgesic effects.
the discovery of  xxxd3289xxx  involved multiple steps of
chemical innovations to become a unique drug. compared
to tramadol, it has a greater cns functional activity at
mor, about the same or slightly more at net, and substantially less at sert. this translates into a higher potency and
clinical efficacy of  xxxd3289xxx  compared to tramadol, despite
the fact that  xxxd3289xxx  has a lower mor activity than
m1-tramadol, because m1-tramadol does not cross the
blood--brain barrier in the same ratio as the tramadol dose is
increased [9].
the two drugs thus have unique preclinical and clinical
profiles appropriate for specific populations of pain patients.
tramadol offers an effective, non-scheduled (in all major
countries) analgesic option that can provide pain relief for
long-term use where strong opioids are not needed or desired,
with low abuse potential [57-59]. its use is optimized by titration to a dose that is compatible with use in patient populations and conditions in which the long-term use of
nsaids, acetaminophen, or strong opioids is not desirable.
the new  xxxd3289xxx  offers analgesia comparable to oxycodone
with more favorable gastrointestinal tolerability [60-62]. the
synergistic contribution of its multi-modal mechanism
(mor plus nri) results in greater analgesic potency in a variety of preclinical models of pain, including neuropathic pain.
this is also evident from the clinical dose conversion factors,
for which a ratio in the range of 1:1.5 to 1:4 for  xxxd3289xxx 
to tramadol can be estimated. thus, with a recommended
maximum daily dose of 400 mg of long-acting tramadol
only 40% of the analgesic effect of a maximum daily dose
(500 mg) of long-acting  xxxd3289xxx  can be expected (assuming a conservative conversion factor of 1:2). already intermediate doses of  xxxd3289xxx  would correspond to tramadol doses
exceeding the recommended daily dose, and escalation of the
tramadol dose to match  xxxd3289xxx ´s analgesic efficacy is not a
viable option. thus, the two drugs provide complementary
options for a broad spectrum of types and magnitudes of

pain, giving patients more treatment options and potentially
leading to better pain management.
more generally,  xxxd3289xxx  might serve as a template for
rational drug discovery efforts in other therapeutic areas.
once the mechanistic targets that account for an existing
drug’s clinical utility (or disadvantages) are identified, targetdirected (or off-target-avoiding) compounds can be designed
and tested. by such an iterative process, the biological targets
can be refined and improvements can be made, resulting in
new drugs that have differentiating clinical attributes that
benefit patients in different yet complementary ways.  xxxd3289xxx  serves as an example both of the approach itself and of
the benefits that can result from such an approach.
