 xxxd2691xxx  acetate:
a  xxxg930xxx  agonist
for the treatment of endometriosis
nancy a. letassy, dennis f. thompson, mark l. britton, and russell r. suda, sr.

abstract:  xxxd2691xxx  acetate is a  xxxg930xxx 
(gnrh) agonist proven as effective as  xxxd1806xxx  in treating endometriosis.
its proposed mechanism of action is the desensitization of pituitary
gnrh receptors leading to a decrease in gonadotropin release, and
ovarian hormone serum concentrations similar to those achieved in
postmenopausal women.  xxxd2691xxx  decreases or ablates the physical
symptoms associated with endometriosis, and pregnancy rates following
therapy with this drug are comparable to rates observed after  xxxd1806xxx 
therapy.  xxxd2691xxx  is administered by nasal inhalation and has been
generally well tolerated. it is associated with a high incidence of adverse
effects but they are rarely severe enough to cause withdrawal from
treatment, and those occurring most frequently-hot flashes, vaginal
dryness, and decreased libido-are a consequence of the
hypoestrogenemia induced by the drug. increased bone turnover occurs
in women on  xxxd2691xxx  but biochemical parameters return to
pretreatment concentrations by six months after termination of
treatment. this agent's place in the therapy of endometriosis will be
determined as clinical experience accumulates.

food and drug administration (fda) for the management
of pelvic pain and shrinkage of implants in endometriosis.
leuprolide,  xxxd2229xxx , and  xxxd387xxx  (another gnrh agonist) are also being studied for the treatment of endometriosis.t? the purposes of this article are to review the pathophysiology of endometriosis, to discuss the relative merits
of current treatments, and to focus on the role of  xxxd2691xxx 
in managing this disease.
pathophysiology

endometriosis, a chronic disease of women, is characterized by the presence of functional, proliferating, extrauterine endometrial tissue and capable of producing
mild to disabling symptoms and impairing fertility. the
true incidence of endometriosis in the general population is
difficult to establish because the disease can be present to
any extent without symptoms and diagnosis requires a
women to undergo a surgical procedure. because this extrauterine endometrial tissue is dependent on estrogen for
growth, endometriosis is almost always diagnosed in menstruating women in their late twenties or early thirties and
is rarely found in women prior to menarche or after menopause. approximately 60 percent of women developing
endometriosis are nulliparous."

1990 december. volume24

the etiology of endometriosis is uncertain, but current
belief is that viable endometrial tissue is transported outside the uterine cavity through retrograde menstruation via
the fallopian tubes or through hematogenous or lymphatic
spread. although extrauterine endometrial tissue may be
found anywhere in the body, it is most commonly found
on pelvic structures." once the endometrial tissue is implanted, it depends on hormonal stimulation in a cyclical
manner similar to the uterine endometrium for continued
growth and survival." the pathologic manifestations of endometriosis vary; however, it commonly takes the form of
small, multiple hemorrhagic lesions composed of endometrial glands and stroma. these lesions are usually surrounded by scar tissue and dense adhesions and may form
nodules along the uterosacral ligaments and other pelvic
structures.' evidence suggests that endometriosis is associated with the development of autoantibodies, but further
work will be needed to determine the role that an altered
immune function plays in the pathophysiology of this disease or the infertility associated with it.s
patients with endometriosis may be asymptomatic or
may have extremely disabling symptoms; however, the
frequency and severity of symptoms are not consistently
related to the severity and extent of the disease. the most
commonly reported symptoms are pelvic pain, abnormal
uterine bleeding, dyspareunia, painful defecation, and infertility. the exact incidence of infertility is difficult to determine, but 20-60 percent of women with endometriosis
have complained of infertility, and the disease has been
found in 8-77 percent of infertile women undergoing lap-

arotomies,?
definitive diagnosis of endometriosis requires the visualization of lesions during a laparotomy or laparoscopy.
each patient's disease is placed into one of four possible
stages, according to the revised american fertility society
classification of endometriosis which is based on the location and size of the endometrial lesions, the presence and
extent of adhesions, and the degree of obliteration of the
posterior cul-de-sac: stage i, minimal; stage ii, mild; stage
iii, moderate; and stage iv, severe," staging of the disease
guides therapeutic decisions and helps to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions.

current therapy
treatment goals are to relieve symptoms and preserve
or enhance the patients ability to conceive, if desired. current treatment options include definitive or conservative
surgery and pharmacologic therapy. with the exception of
defmitive surgery, all treatments of endometriosis must be
considered as temporizing measures only, as the disease
and symptoms generally recur after conservative surgery
or cessation of pharmacologic therapy. in infertility cases
with or without pain, temporizing measures are often initiated with the intent that the patient will try to become pregnant after the conclusion of therapy. likelihood of pregnancy appears to be greatest within the first six months
posttherapy.w"
defmitive surgery, usually reserved for women who do
not desire future conception, involves the removal of the
uterus and ovaries and is the only treatment that prevents
recurrence of disease. conservative surgery is used to ab-

late lesions and remove adhesions and endometriomas
while preserving the woman's childbearing potential. following conservative surgery, reported pregnancy rates in
women with normal fertility potential (all other causes of
infertility except endometriosis have been ruled out) are
66-100 percent of women with mild disease, 43.8-74.0
percent of women with moderate disease, and 0-48 percent of women with severe disease.pv the disease and its
symptoms recur in approximately 40 percent of women
five years after conservative surgery.v-"
pharmacologic agents currently used to treat endometriosis include estrogen/progestin combination products,
 xxxd2554xxx , and  xxxd1806xxx . nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory agents are also used to manage pelvic
pain. although not labeled by the fda for endometriosis
treatment, since 1958 estrogen/progestin combination pills
and the progestin  xxxd2554xxx  have been
used to induce a state of pseudopregnancy." today, they
are primarily used as second-line agents for women who
do not tolerate  xxxd1806xxx  therapy or for short-term use following conservative surgery. pregnancy rates reported in
women after pseudopregnancy therapy have been approximately 40 percent. 20,21
 xxxd1806xxx , a compound with androgenic and antiestrogenic activity, was previously the only hormonal agent
with labeling approved by the fda for treating endometriosis. it causes regression of endometrial lesions and concurrent symptom relief in up to 95 percent of women. i0,22
an interesting salutary and yet unexplained effect of
 xxxd1806xxx  is its ability to suppress titers of autoantibody directed at endometrial antigens.» reported pregnancy rates
in women with normal fertility potential treated with  xxxd1806xxx  are 80-83 percent with mild disease, 38-72 percent
with moderate disease, and 37.5--66.0 percent with severe
disease.p-'
almost all women treated with  xxxd1806xxx  experience
some adverse reaction to therapy; however, only three to
seven percent of women have discontinued therapy because of these effects in studies evaluating  xxxd1806xxx 's role
in the therapy of endometriosis. 12,24-26 the adverse effects
are related to its androgenic and antiestrogenic effects and
include weight gain, oily skin and hair, acne, hirsutism,
voice deepening, decrease in breast size, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, muscle cramps, edema, and depression. a
small study of six women taking  xxxd1806xxx  800 mg/d and
participating in an aerobic exercise program three to five
times weekly for six months reported a weight gain of less
than five pounds for all women, and no edema, hirsutism,
or oily skin and hair,'? the incidence of these effects was
much lower in this small study than is usually reported in
other studies. ' 2,24-26 larger studies are needed to defme the
potential benefit of aerobic exercise in decreasing the adverse effects of  xxxd1806xxx .
this agent has also been found to decrease high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol by 48 percent and to increase lowdensity lipoprotein by 19-41 percent during treatment,
with values returning to pretreatment levels within one
month after therapy is withdrawn."
the recommended dosage of  xxxd1806xxx  is 800 mg/d, but
400 and 600 mg/d have also been found effective.t'-"
therapy usually continues for six to nine months at an average monthly wholesale cost of $240 for the 400-mg bid
regimen. in comparison, the recommended dosage of naf-

arelin is 200 ug bid administered intranasally for six
months at an average monthly wholesale cost of $282. 29
an alternative agent is needed for women who cann?t
tolerate  xxxd1806xxx 's adverse effects and for whom surgery is
not an option. with the introduction of the gnrh agonists,
another pharmacologic therapy is now available for these
women.
pharmacology

under normal physiologic conditions in women, the hypothalamus secretes gnrh which controls the release of
the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormo~e (f~h! and
luteinizing hormone (lh) from the antenor prtuitary.
these gonadotropins stimulate first the development of
ovarian follicles that produce estrogen and then the corpus
luteum that produces estrogen and progesterone. ,!,hese
ovarian hormones are responsible for the changes in the
uterine endometrium during the menstrual cycle and for
the growth and proliferation of extrauterine endometrial
tissue in endometriosis.
release of fsh and lh is highly dependent on pulsed
release of endogenous gnrh. belchetz et al: f?u~d.t?at

 xxxd2691xxx  about 200 times more active on a weight basis
than is endogenous gnrh,31 causes a paradoxi~al ~es~ns~­
tization of the pituitary gnrh receptors, resultmg in inhibition of the release of fsh and lh and ultimately decreased concentrations of estrogens and progesterone.
 xxxd2691xxx  appears to inhibit gonadotropin hormone !elease in a dose-dependent manner. monroe et al. studied
the effects of increasing doses of  xxxd2691xxx  on serum estradiol concentrations and found that daily intranasal administration of  xxxd2691xxx  125 ug for one month resulted in
mean estradiol concentrations of 183-275 pmol/l in women with pretreatment concentrations of 440 pmol/l.j2 (in
normal premenopausal women, midluteal estradiol concentrations are between 367 and 734 pmol/l..") after one
month of therapy with daily intranasal doses of both 250
and 1000 ug, the mean estradiol concentration in these
women was 91 pmol/l, suggesting that a plateau effect occurs between the intranasal  xxxd2691xxx  doses of 125 and 250
jlg/d. 32 interestingly,  xxxd2691xxx  initially increases estr~diol
concentrations to about 550 pmol/l but concentrations
quickly return to the levels not~d above. alt~ou.gh there
have been no reports of worsemng endometriosis symptoms resulting from this surge of estradiol, there have ~n
reports of worsening prostate cancer symptom~ resultmg
from the initial surge of androgens observed with the use
of the gnrh agonist leuprolide."
.
although desensitization of gnrh receptors is the '!10st
likely mechanism by which  xxxd2691xxx  ~auses a reversible,
chemical oophorectomy, other mechamsms have been postulated. meldrum et al. suggest that  xxxd2691xxx  may decrease
the activity of fsh and lh and desensitize the ovarian g?""
nadotropin receptors." tureck et al. propose that nafarehn
may directly inhibit ovarian function."

six position where  xxxd2691xxx  has a substituted d-naphthyl1206

alanine in place of glycine (figure i). this substitution
makes  xxxd2691xxx  more lipophilic than gnrh and may account for its longer duration of action.
biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics

as with most other peptide drugs,  xxxd2691xxx  cannot be
given orally because it is rapi~ly de~aded in ~he stomach.
early human and animal studies with nafarehn evaluated
daily subcutaneous administration which is e.ffecti~e, but
somewhat impractical, for the ambulatory patient with endometriosis.v" hoffman et al. determined an absolute
bioavailability of 9.2 and 2.0 percent in two healthy men
for the intranasal preparation (without sodium  xxxd2218xxx ), compared to intravenous administration." chan et al.
evaluated the absorption of  xxxd2691xxx  after nasal, subcutaneous sublingual, and vaginal administration. ten women
(aged '32-59 y) and 23 men (aged 20-54 y) participated in
the trial. single doses of 500 ug intranasally, 5 ug subcutaneously, 500 ug vaginally, and 1 mg sublingually were
given." serum concentrations of  xxxd2691xxx  were measured
by radioimmunoassay as described by ~erenberg ~t al. 44
 xxxd2691xxx  was poorly absorbed after sublmgual and mtravaginal administration with concentrations less than 37.8
pmol/l, the lowest concentration detec~able w~th the assay.
however, administration of 100-jll inhalations to each
nostril of a 2.5-mg/ml  xxxd2691xxx  solution resulted in peak
serum concentrations of approximately 1.2 nmol/l at 20 to
40 minutes after administration. the authors also found
that the addition of 2% sodium  xxxd2218xxx  significantly
improved intranasal absorption. the r~lative bioav~ilabi.li­
ty of the optimum intranasal formulation of nafarelm with
sodium  xxxd2218xxx  was 21 percent (range 4-37 percent),
compared to the subcutaneous route." .
...
there is limited information concemmg the distribution
of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate in humans. chan and chaplin determined the protein-binding characteristics of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate in vitro. using equilibrium dialysis with fresh plasma
from normal human subjects, these investigators found
that 78-84 percent of  xxxd2691xxx  acetate was pr~tein b~un~,

percent of the radioactivity in the urine."
clinical studies

studies evaluating the clinical efficacy of  xxxd2691xxx  have
found it to be as effective as  xxxd1806xxx  in the treatment of endometriosis.
eight women 25-37 years of age with lap~oscopica~ly
documented endometriosis received nafarehn 500 ug 10tranasally q12h for a six-month course of t~erapy. one
woman withdrew from the study after developmg leukopenia eight weeks into therapy. after discontinuing na~~lin,

nonna!. the cause of the leukopenia was not determined,
the other seven women completed the study,"
severity of the disease was assessed during the initial
surgical examination. thereafter, patients received monthly physical examinations and interviews to assess the degree of symptoms and were reexamined surgically by laparotomy or laparoscopy at the end of the six-month study.
all women had a significant decrease in the number of active endometrial implants (p<0.02), with no implants
found in five of seven women. only one of three patients
with adhesive disease had a significant decrease in the extent of disease during therapy. one patient had an endometrioma that remained throughout treatment. all reported significant relief of symptoms by the fourth week of
therapy and maximal relief by the twelfth week."
all women were anovulatory and had amenorrhea during therapy as expected. initially, all had an increase in lh
and fsh concentrations; however, these levels fell significantly within two weeks of beginning treatment and remained low throughout treatment. estradiol concentrations
were elevated the first month of therapy in all women but
then decreased to less than 110 pmol/l, similar to levels
found in menopausal women. during therapy one patient
inexplicably had intermittent increases in estradiol levels
resulting in some vaginal bleeding. progesterone concentrations in all patients were minimally elevated during the
first days of treatment, then decreased and remained at less
than 1.59 nmol/l for the duration of the study." (plasma
progesterone concentration is approximately 3."18 nmol/l,
during the luteal phase.")
all women experienced adverse reactions attributable to
hypoestrogenemia with hot flashes being the most significant. in fact, hot flashes were severe enough in three patients to necessitate a reduction in  xxxd2691xxx  dose to 250 ug
q 12h, which lessened the severity of the hot flashes without reducing efficacy. other complaints included mild
transient headaches in five of seven women, vaginal dryness in four of seven, mild transient depression in two of
seven, and leukopenia in one of the eight women. all of
the symptoms of hypoestrogenemia resolved one month
after discontinuation of therapy. menses resumed in an average 47±8 days (range 36-57 d), and dysmenorrhea returned to some degree in six of seven women within three
to six months after treatment. the effects of  xxxd2691xxx  on
bone resorption were not assessed in this trial.46
in a large multicenter study,  xxxd2691xxx  was compared
with  xxxd1806xxx  for treating endometriosis. the trial was a
parallel, randomized, double-blind, double-placebo design
including 236 women 18-45 years of age with pelvic endometriosis documented by laparoscopy or laparotomy.
patients were randomized to receive intranasal  xxxd2691xxx 
200 ug bid and one placebo tablet bid (n=77), intranasal
 xxxd2691xxx  400 ug bid and one placebo tablet bid (n=79), or
one  xxxd1806xxx  400 mg tablet bid and placebo nasal spray bid
(n=80), with each regimen beginning during the first four
days of a menstrual cycle and continuing for six months.
severity of disease was scored using the revised american
fertility society classification."
of the 236 women admitted to the study, 213 completed
six months of therapy. reasons for the withdrawal of 23
subjects included hot flashes from  xxxd2691xxx  800 ilg/d in
seven women, hot flashes from  xxxd1806xxx  in four women,
rapid elevations of hepatic enzymes with  xxxd1806xxx  therapy

laparoscopy performed after six months of treatment
revealed a significant decrease in disease scoring within all
treatment groups (p=o.ooo 1); however, there was not a
significant difference in disease scoring among any of the
groups. both dosage regimens of  xxxd2691xxx  were as effective as  xxxd1806xxx  in treating endometriosis. the disease progressed in six patients taking  xxxd2691xxx  and six taking danazo!. symptoms of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain
and tenderness, and pelvic induration were significantly reduced in each treatment group, but there was not a statistically significant difference among groups."
conception was desired by 149 women: 48 treated with
 xxxd2691xxx  800 ug, 56 treated with  xxxd2691xxx  400 ug, and 45
treated with danazo!. pregnancy rates twelve months posttherapy were 52 percent for patients who received  xxxd2691xxx  800 ug, 30 percent for patients who received  xxxd2691xxx 
400 ug, and 36 percent for those who received danazo!.
there were no significant differences in pregnancy rates
among the three treatment groups,«
hot flashes occurred in 90 percent of patients using  xxxd2691xxx  and 68 percent using danazo!. the statistical significance of this difference was not reported by the authors.
edema and myalgia were more frequently associated with
 xxxd1806xxx  therapy; decreased libido, vaginal dryness, and
nasal irritation were more frequently reported in patients
receiving  xxxd2691xxx  therapy. headache, emotional lability,
and nervousness were reported with equal frequency for
both drugs. the investigators reported that weight gain
was seen more frequently in patients receiving  xxxd1806xxx 
therapy and that this was significantly different from the
other two treatment groups (p<0.001); however, the investigators did not report the details concerning weight gain in
any of the treatment groups. finally, henzl et a!. reported
that  xxxd1806xxx  treatment was associated with a significant
decrease in mean concentrations of high-density lipoproteins and an increase in mean levels of low-density lipoproteins when compared with baseline values and the  xxxd2691xxx  group. the data concerning lipid changes were not
available for any of the treatment groups."

adverse reactions
the most frequent adverse effects of  xxxd2691xxx  are a consequence of the hypoestrogenemia induced by the drug.

dicp. the annals ofpharmacotherapy •

1990 december. volume 24 •

1207

virtually all women treated with this agent experience
varying degree of hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and decreased libido; however, these symptoms have rarely been
severe enough for patients to withdraw from clinical studies. these adverse effects differ from those reported by patients taking  xxxd1806xxx  (table i). some women may prefer
the adverse effects of  xxxd2691xxx  to the androgenic manifestations of  xxxd1806xxx  therapy. only further clinical experience
will determine if this is true.
postmenopausal women suffer from increasing bone
loss and osteoporosis. because  xxxd2691xxx  induces a "chemical menopause," attention has focused on its effect on calcium mobilization during therapy. johansen et al. evaluated 16 premenopausal women given intranasal  xxxd2691xxx 
200 jlg/d and 9 premenopausal women given 400 jlg/d
over six months. these investigators measured the bone
mineral content of the forearm by single photon absorptiometry and of the spine by dual photon absorptiometry
along with other measures of increased bone turnover such
as urinary concentrations of hydroxyproline, calcium, and
creatinine. both doses resulted in an increased bone turnover with the 400-jlg dose causing a significant loss in
forearm and spine bone content. six months after termination, the biochemical parameters had returned to pretreatment values." these data are consistent with the fmdings
of devogelaer et al. 49 and results noted with other gnrh
analogs.v" in contrast to these results, tummon et al.
found only a slightly decreased lumbar bone mineral density measured by dual photon absorptiometry in 38 premenopausal women taking the gnrh analog  xxxd387xxx .u
however, these data are difficult to compare because each
patient in the tummon et al. study received oral calcium i
g/d during the study. the clinical significance of this bone
loss is unknown although it is clearly an undesirable effect.

 xxxd2691xxx  offers a new pharmacologic approach to managing endometriosis. however, the first-line pharmacologic agent should remain  xxxd1806xxx  because of its established
long-term safety record and because of limited clinical experience with  xxxd2691xxx . both agents are associated with a
high incidence of adverse effects:  xxxd1806xxx  with androgenic
and  xxxd2691xxx  with hypoestrogenic effects. in short-term
trials, the undesirable effects of  xxxd1806xxx  on lipoproteins
and of  xxxd2691xxx  on bone loss appear to be clinically insignificant with these effects resolving after drugs are discontinued. the clinical significance of these changes with
chronic therapy has not been assessed. when more clinical
experience is gained with  xxxd2691xxx  and its long-term safety
profile is established, it may be possible for women to play
a role in the selection of a pharmacologic agent to manage
their endometriosis based on the expected adverse-effect
profiles of  xxxd1806xxx  and  xxxd2691xxx . in the meantime,  xxxd2691xxx  should remain an alternative treatment for those women unable to tolerate the adverse effects of  xxxd1806xxx  therapy.~

the authors are indebted to angela l. grant for expen technical assistance in helping

extracto

 xxxd2691xxx  es un agonista de la hormona liberadora de gonadotropina
(gnrh) que ha demostrado ser tan efectivo como  xxxd1806xxx  en el
tratamiento de endometriosis, ei mecanismo de acci6n es por
desensitizaci6n de receptores pituitaricos de gnrh que conducen a una
disminuci6n en la liberaci6n de gonadotropina y en las concentraciones
sericas de hormonas ovaricas similar a las alcanzadas en mujeres
postrnenopausia.  xxxd2691xxx  disminuye 0 elimina los sintomas ffsicos
asociados con endometriosis. la proporci6n de embarazos luego de la
terapia con  xxxd2691xxx  son comparables con los observados con  xxxd1806xxx .
 xxxd2691xxx  se administra por inhalaci6n nasal, siendo esta bien tolerada.
aunque esta asociada con una alta incidencia de efectos adversos, estos
rata vez requieren descontinuar el medicamento. los efectos adversos
mas frecuentes son oleadas de calor, sequedad de la vagina y
disminuci6n en libido, los cuales estan relacionados con la
hipoestrogenemia que induce el medicamento.  xxxd2691xxx  causa un
aumento en la mobilizaci6n osea, pero los parametres bioquimicos
regresan a su nivel base seis semanas luego de descontinuar el
tratarniento. ei rol de  xxxd2691xxx  en el tratamiento de endometriosis sera
determinado segun se obtenga mas experiencia c1inicay su perfil de
seguridad a largo plazo sea establecido.

resume

la nafareline est un agoniste de l'hormone liberant la gonadotropine
(gnrh) dont on a demontre l'efficacite egale acelie du  xxxd1806xxx  dans ie
traitement de l'endornetriose. le mecanisme d'action propose est la
desensibilisation des recepteurs hypophysaires de la gnrh conduisant a
une diminution de la liberation de gonadotropine et des concentrations
seriques des hormones ovariennes semblables acelles recontrees chez
les femmes post-menopausees. la nafareline diminue ou enraye les
sympt6mes physiques associes a l'endornetriose. le taux de grossesses
observees suivant la therapie a la nafareline est comparable acelui
suivant la therapie au  xxxd1806xxx . la nafareline est administree par
inhalation nasale et est generalement bien toleree. elle est associee aune
incidence elevee d' effets secondaires mais qui necessitent rarement la
cessation due traitement. les plus frequents, les bouffees de chaleur, la
secheresse vaginale et la diminution de la libido resultent de
l'hypoestrogenemie induite par ce medicament. l'augmentation de la
regeneration cellulaire osseuse survient chez les femmes traitees a la
nafareline mais les parametres biochimiques reviennent aux valeurs
pre-traitement dans les six mois suivant i'arret du traitement. la place de
la nafareline dans ie traitement de i' endometriose sera determinee avec
une plus grande experience clinique.
