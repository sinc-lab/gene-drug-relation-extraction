tubulin is an attractive and established target for anticancer therapy. to date, the only method to determine the binding
of inhibitor to tubulin has been competitive radioligand binding assays. we developed a non-radioactive mass spectrometry
(ms) binding assay to study the tubulin binding of colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel and to identify which of these three
binding sites that a novel inhibitor binds. the method involves a very simple step of separating the unbound ligand from
macromolecules using ultrafiltration. the unbound ligand in the filtrate can be accurately determined using highly sensitive
and specific liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (lc-ms/ms) method using multiple reaction monitoring (mrm)
mode. the assay was validated using  xxxd2980xxx , vincristine and docetaxel, drugs that compete to the colchicine-,
vinblastine- and paclitaxel-binding sites in tubulin, respectively. this competitive binding assay allowed the reliable detection
of interactions of these drugs with three binding sites on tubulin. this method was subsequently applied to determine the
tubulin-binding site of 4-substituted methoxylbenzoyl-aryl-thiazoles (smart-h), a potent antitubulin agent developed in our
laboratory. the results indicated that smart-h specifically and reversibly bound only to the colchicine-binding site, but not to
vinblastine- or paclitaxel sites. this new non-radioligand binding method to determine the binding site on tubulin will function

tubulins are the building blocks of microtubules, which are
dynamic structural components of the cellular cytoskeleton. polymerization and depolymerization of microtubules play important
roles during normal cell division, while perturbing microtubule
function leads to mitotic attract and ultimately to cell death by
apoptosis.[1,2] antitubulin agents continue to arrest significant
attention in drug discovery pipelines owing to their chemotherapeutic potential.[3,4] antitubulin agents are divided into two
categories, microtubule stabilizers and destabilizers, based on their
ability to bind to tubulin and change the ratio between assembled
microtubules and dimeric tubulin. recently, we developed a class
of potent antitubulin agents, 4-substituted methoxylbenzoyl-arylthiazoles (smart), which effectively inhibit tubulin polymerization,
and exhibit low nanomolar cytotoxic ic50 values in a variety of
cancer cell types.[5]
in vitro, the equilibrium between the dimeric and polymeric
forms of tubulin can be altered by different effecters, such
as  xxxd1896xxx  (dmso),[6] cofactors [mg2+ , guanosine-5 triphosphate (gtp), guanosine-5 -diphosphate (gdp)],[7] or small
molecules,[8,9] which alter the stability of tubulin dimers or the
polymerization process. three unique binding sites for small
molecule antitubulin agents are known and are responsible
for the interactions and pharmacologic effect of paclitaxel,
vinblastine and colchicine.[10,11] paclitaxel, which preferably binds
to polymeric tubulin as opposed to its dimeric form, is a classic
type of microtubule-stabilizing agent. at high concentration,
paclitaxel promotes the assembly of all the available tubulin

j. mass. spectrom. 2010, 45, 1160–1166

into microtubules.[8] vinblastine and colchicine are microtubuledestabilizing agents, which prefer to bind to dimeric tubulin.
vinblastine binds to the  xxxg2353xxx  subunit at a distinct region
known as the vinca-binding domain, while colchicine binds to the
beta-subunit at the interface with alpha-monomer of the same tubulin
molecule. small amounts of the tubulin–colchicine complex
will copolymerize with free tubulin, with colchicine remaining
bound to the microtubule.[12] the dissociation of colchicine
from tubulin is extremely slow.[13] as occurs with vinblastine,
colchicine depolymerizes microtubules at high concentrations.
both colchicine and vinblastine effectively halt microtubule
dynamics at low concentrations.
radioligand binding assays have been used over the past two
decades to characterize the binding of small molecule inhibitors
to tubulin.[14] although such assays provide a sensitive method
to study ligand–target interactions, radioligand assays also have
inherent disadvantages, including the need for expensive radiolabeled drugs that require special handling, disposal, detection and
synthesis. issues related to isotope effects and stability may also

ms binding assay for characterization of binding sites of tubulin
complicate such assays, but are often overlooked or ignored.[15]
mass spectrometry (ms) provides an alternative technique for sensitive and selective quantification of ligand that can be applied to
the study of ligand–target interactions.[16,17] ultrafiltration ms has
been developed for the screening ligand–target interactions, such
as estrogen receptors,[18] and human retinoid x receptors.[19] ultrafiltration is used to separate unbound low-mass compounds from
ligand–receptor complexes. therefore, unbound compounds can
be quantified by lc-ms/ms. using ms to study binding is so-called
ms binding assays, which share all of the advantages and principles
of radioligand binding assays, but eliminate the disadvantages of
radioactive use and allow for simultaneous measurement of different ligands that cannot be accomplished when using radioligands
because of limitations associated with using and the sole availability of 3 h or 14 c-labeled radioligands. there are additional
differences between ms binding and radioligand binding assays.
bound radioligand as a fraction of total radioactivity is always
measured during radioligand binding assays, while the concentration of free ligand after protein precipitation is quantified during
ms analysis. alternatively, ms binding assay can be also used to
directly quantify the concentration of unbound ligand.[20 – 22]
in this study, we developed an ms binding method to
determine the binding site of a novel antitubulin drug on tubulin.
the non-radiolabeled ligand was incubated with tubulin, and
then the unbound fraction was isolated by ultrafiltration. the
filtrate was injected into the lc-ms/ms system without further
sample preparation. three well-known tubulin binders, colchicine,
vinblastine and paclitaxel, were used to optimize and validate
the binding study with tubulin. the optimized binder and tubulin
concentrations were then used to examine the tubulin-binding
characteristics of their competitors,  xxxd2980xxx , vincristine
and docetaxel, respectively. once validated, this ms binding assay
was applied to determine the binding site of a novel smart
compound (smart-h). the method demonstrated that smart-h
effectively and specifically bound to the colchicine-binding site,
but not to vinblastine- or paclitaxel-binding sites. in addition, the
ability of colchicine to displace smart-h from its tubulin-binding
site was assessed, a feat not possible using standard radioligand
binding assays without the synthesis of radiolabeled smart-h.
these studies provide the first evidence that ms can be used to
quickly and selectively identify the tubulin-binding site of novel
small molecule inhibitors.

in vitro tubulin polymerization assay
bovine brain tubulin (0.2 mg) (cytoskeleton, denver, co) was
mixed with vehicle (dmso, 5% v/v) and gtp (1 mm) and incubated
in 100 µl of buffer (80 mm piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic
acid) (pipes), 2.0 mm mgcl2 , 0.5 mm ethylene glycol tetraacetic
acid (egta), ph 6.9) at 37 ◦ c for 1 h. the absorbance at 340 nm
wavelength was monitored every minute (synergy 4 microplate
reader, bio-tek instruments, winooski, vt). the spectrophotometer was maintained at 37 ◦ c for tubulin polymerization.

ms binding assay using ultrafiltration
colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel were prepared in dmso at
25 µm; 5 µl of each was spiked (final concentration, 1.2 µm) and
incubated with varying concentrations of tubulin (8–4000 µg/ml)
in 100 µl incubation buffer (80 mm pipes, 2.0 mm mgcl2 , 0.5 mm
egta, ph 6.9) in a shaking incubator (37 ◦ c) for 1 h. to study
the colchicine and vinblastine binding sites, the incubations were
performed under conditions which did not contain gtp because
these ligands prefer to bind to dimeric tubulin. for paclitaxelbinding studies, preformed microtubules in 100 µl incubation
buffer were prepared by pre-incubating tubulin in the presence
of gtp (1 mm) for 1 h. paclitaxel (5 µl of 25 µm) was added to the
preformed microtubules, and incubated for an additional hour.
the unbound ligands were separated from tubulin or microtubules
using an ultrafiltration method (microconcentrator) (microcon,
bedford, ma) with a molecular cutoff size of 30 kda. samples were
collected by centrifuge at 14 000 g for 30 min. the filtrate (50 µl)
was diluted with acetonitrile/h2 o (1/2) (150 µl) containing 200-nm
internal standard. the final volume was 200 µl. an aliquot of 10 µl
was injected into the lc-ms/ms system.

validation of the lc-ms/ms method
standard analyte solutions were prepared in the loading buffer
(25% tubulin buffer, 25% acetonitrile, and 50%h2 o). solutions containing all three standards (vinblastine, colchicine and paclitaxel)
at concentrations of 0.4, 0.8, 2, 4, 8, 20, 40, 80, 200, 400, 800, 2000,
4000, 8000 and 20 000 nm were used to examine the linearity and
establish calibration curves. two concentrations, 200 and 1000
nm, were used to examine intra-day (morning and evening) and
inter-day (two consecutive days) variation.

competitive ms binding assay
competitive ms binding assay was conducted as previously
described but with slightly different conditions for colchicine,
vinblastine and paclitaxel binding. colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel (1.2 µm for each) were incubated with tubulin (1.3 mg/ml)
in the incubation buffer (80-mm pipes, 2.0-mm mgcl2 , 0.5-mm egta,
ph 6.9) at 37 ◦ c for 1 h. varying concentrations (0.1–125 µm) of
 xxxd2980xxx , vincristine and docetaxel were used to compete
with colchicine-, vinblastine- and paclitaxel–tubulin binding, respectively. after incubation, the filtrate was obtained as previously
described. smart-h (0.5–125 µm) was examined to individually
compete with colchicine-, vinblastine- and paclitaxel–tubulin
binding. the ability of the competitor or smart-h to inhibit
the binding of ligands was expressed as a percentage of control
binding in the absence of any competitor. each study was run in
triplicate.

by the lc-ms/ms method using the same chromatographic

each experiment was performed in triplicate.

results and discussion
lc-ms/ms method for colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel
the full-scan electrospray mass spectra of colchicine, vinblastine
and paclitaxel were obtained by infusion of a solution of each
analyte [final concentration 2 µm in h2 o/acetonitrile/ xxxd2154xxx 
(50 : 50 : 0.1)] into the mass spectrometer (data not shown). the
data indicated that singly charged species were the predominant
ions for colchicine ([m + h]+ , m/z 400) and paclitaxel (mh+ , m/z
854 and [m + na]+ , m/z 876) in full-scan mode by electrospray
ionization (esi). however, the intensity of the [m + 2h]2+ ion at
m/z 406 was more than five times greater than that of the singly
charged [m + h]+ ion for vinblastine. the singly charged precursor
ions of colchicine and paclitaxel, and the doubly charged precursor
ion of vinblastine were selected for fragmentation to generate
respective product ions (fig. 1a–c). the ms/ms spectrum of
colchicine (fig. 1a) was consistent with that of emuri et al. and
yao et al.,[23,24] who reported the major fragment ions (m/z 358,
310, 326, 282) from the singly protonated form of colchicine. in

ms binding assay for characterization of binding sites of tubulin
fig. 1b, the predominant product ion m/z 272 of double-charged
vinblastine was consistent with dennison.[25] for paclitaxel (m/z
854), the main fragment ions, m/z 569, 551, 509 and 286 were
consistent with liia et al.[26] in subsequent experiments using
mrm modes for quantitative measurement, the mrm ion pairs,
m/z 400 → 310, 406 → 272 and 854 → 286, were selected to
result in a highly specific and sensitive method for quantitation
of colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel, respectively. an internal
standard, an analog of smart compounds, was added to improve
the analytical accuracy of the quantitative method.
the lc-ms/ms method reported here included c4 reversedphase chromatography using a gradient program of acetonitrile/water with 0.1%  xxxd2154xxx . the chromatograms indicate
that colchicine, vinblastine, paclitaxel, and the internal standard
were completely separated under these chromatographic conditions (fig. 1d). to our knowledge, this is the first analytical method
with the capability to simultaneously quantify the three antitubulin
agents in a well-separated chromatography.
intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were determined
using current lc-ms/ms methodology (table 1). precision and
accuracy using two concentrations, 200 and 1000 nm, were below
7% among all three analytes. all three analytes exhibited the same
detection limit (s/n > 3) with 0.8 nm. in addition, their linearity
exhibited 4–5 order of magnitudes. these data suggest that the
lc-ms/ms methodology provided a reliable quantification for
vinblastine, colchicine and paclitaxel.

figure 2a shows the effects of 1 mm gtp, 5% dmso, and the
combination effects of gtp and dmso on tubulin polymerization,
respectively. the buffer (without added gtp or dmso) did not
significantly cause tubulin aggregation. tubulin polymerization
was monitored at 340 nm in a 96-well plate thermostated to 37 ◦ c.
both dmso and gtp promoted tubulin aggregation, while the
combination produced a hyperbolic curve with a higher plateau,
suggesting that gtp and dmso synergistically increased the extent
of tubulin polymerization. figure 2b shows the polymerization
curve that was obtained when tubulin was pre-incubated with gtp
(1 mm) for 1 h prior to the addition of dmso or buffer. the extent
of tubulin polymerization increased after dmso was added. these
data suggested that pre-incubation with gtp (fig. 2b) should be
avoided when performing studies to examine binding to dimeric
tubulin (e.g. colchicine and vinblastine), but would be beneficial
when performing studies with paclitaxel, which preferentially
binds to polymeric microtubules.

colchicine (1.2 µm) was incubated with varying concentrations
of tubulin in the absence of gtp for 1 h. ultrafiltration was
then used to separate free colchicine and macromolecules,
such as tubulin and microtubules. the filtrate was used for
quantification without further sample preparation. figure 3a
shows that the percentage of colchicine bound to tubulin
increased with increasing tubulin concentrations, and approached
90% at tubulin concentration >1 mg/ml. the vinblastine–tubulin
binding (fig. 3b) was examined under the same conditions. for
paclitaxel–tubulin binding, tubulin (4 mg/ml) was pre-incubated
in the presence of 1 mm gtp to generate partial microtubules,
and then titrated to the indicated tubulin concentrations.
paclitaxel (1.2 µm) was then incubated with the preformed

competitive ms binding assay and its application to determine
the binding site of smart-h on tubulin
tubulin (1–1.5 mg/ml) was incubated with colchicine, vinblastine
and paclitaxel (1.2 µm). both colchicine- and vinblastine–tubulin
binding studies were examined in the absence of gtp without preincubation. paclitaxel–tubulin binding studies were performed
after pre-incubation of tubulin with gtp for 1 h. podophylltoxin, vincristine and docetaxel are well-known competitors for
colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel, respectively, binding to
tubulin. as shown in fig. 4b–d, the ms competitive binding
method demonstrated that podophylltoxin, vincristine and docetaxel effectively competed for the colchicine-, vinblastine- and
paclitaxel–tubulin binding sites, respectively, indicating that competitive displacement of the known ligand can be quantified
and identified using this newly developed ms binding assay.
the ms competitive binding method was further employed to
determine the binding site of smart-h (fig. 4a) on tubulin.
smart-h is a novel antitubulin agent that potently inhibits tubulin
polymerization.[5] varying concentrations of smart-h were used
to compete with colchicine-, vinblastine- and paclitaxel–tubulin
binding. figure 4b–d show that smart-h competed effectively
and specifically with colchicine–tubulin binding, but not to the
vinca alkaloid or paclitaxel sites, indicating that smart-h bound
to the colchicine-binding site on tubulin. the competitive binding
curve of smart-h deviates substantially from 0 at high concentrations, suggesting that smart-h may exhibit nonspecific binding or
achievement of its saturated solubility. the ic50 value of smart-h
in competitive binding curve was slightly less that of  xxxd2980xxx , suggesting that determinations of relative affinity to tubulin
can also be obtained using this method.

and paclitaxel prefers to bind to polymeric microtubule, their incubation
conditions were different. in panels a and b, colchicine or vinblastine was
incubated with tubulin in the absence of gtp for 1 h. in panel c, tubulins

microtubules binding study (fig. 3c). figure 3a–c show that
tubulin concentrations of 1000 µg/ml or greater bound >80%
of each ligand. thus tubulin concentrations of 1–1.5 mg/ml were
used for further competitive binding studies.
the tubulin-binding assays were performed in a nonvolatile
incubation buffer, which is not compatible with the ms system.
however, the incubation buffer can be diverted into waste by a
simple switching valve during hplc, avoiding its entrance to the
ms system. the analytes (e.g. colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel)
were retained longer in the column and then were detected by
lc-ms/ms. therefore, no further sample preparation (desalting)
was needed after ultrafiltration. this approach is not limited by

wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/jms

the ability to use non-radiolabeled ligand in the ms binding assay
allowed us to also examine the ability of colchicine to displace
smart-h from tubulin binding site. varying concentrations of
colchicine were used to compete for the binding of tubulin
(1 mg/ml) by smart-h (1 µm). the lc-ms/ms was set to detect
smart-h (m/z 356 → 188) with the same chromatographic
conditions (data not shown). colchicine competed effectively
with the smart-h-tubulin binding (fig. 5), suggesting that the
binding of smart-h to tubulin is not covalent and further
corroborating the conclusion that the binding site for smart-h
overlaps with the colchicine-binding site. this reversible binding
study demonstrated that competitive ms binding assay is simple
and widely applicable to non-radiolabeled agents.

conclusions
we developed an ms-based assay to study the interactions of small
molecule inhibitors with tubulin. the concentration of unbound
ligands was determined after one-step sample purification using
ultrafiltration. the assay is broadly applicable to any small molecule
that can be measured by ms, as demonstrated by studies using
colchicine,  xxxd2980xxx , vinblastine, vincristine, paclitaxel,
docetaxel and smart-h. the assay was used to demonstrate
that smart-h reversibly competes for the colchicine-binding site

ms binding assay for characterization of binding sites of tubulin

figure 4. ms competitive binding studies. smart-h (a) competes with colchicine (b), but not with vinblastine (c) and paclitaxel (d) to bind to tubulin
(1.3 mg/ml). in panel b and c, tubulin was incubated with colchicine or vinblastine (1.2 µm) in the absence of gtp with increasing concentrations of test
compound. in panel d, preformed microtubules were incubated with paclitaxel (1.2 µm) and 1 mm gtp, and increasing concentrations of test compound.
podophylltoxin, vincristine and docetaxel were used as positive controls for competitive binding with colchicine, vincristine and paclitaxel, respectively.
vehicle was 5% dmso; bar, sd. (n = 3).

on tubulin with an affinity slightly less than  xxxd2980xxx .
the assay does not require the use of radiolabeled materials,
can be used to study drugs that inhibit or promote tubulin
polymerization, and could be applied to drugs with unknown
binding sites in tubulin and thus represents a novel technique with
broad applicability in the study of ligand–tubulin interactions.
