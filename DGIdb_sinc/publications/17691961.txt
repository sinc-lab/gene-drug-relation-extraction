abstract: the metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with insulin resistance and consists of a
constellation of factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia that raise the risk for cardiovascular
diseases and diabetes mellitus. there is widespread agreement that the renin-angiotensin system

strongest binding affinity to  xxxg100xxx . further,  xxxd3303xxx  is reported to act as a partial agonist of
 xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx ). these observations suggest that, due to its
unique  xxxg1807xxx -modulating activity,  xxxd3303xxx  may be one of the most promising sartans for the
treatment of cardiometabolic disorders. in this paper, we reviewed the potential utility of  xxxd3303xxx  in
insulin resistance and vascular complications in diabetes.

introduction
there is a growing body of evidence that blood
pressure (bp) level is one of the major determinants
of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in
individuals [1,2]. further, a recent analysis by the
blood pressure lowering treatment trialists’
collaboration (bplttc) revealed that any commonlyused bp-lowering regimen reduced the risk of total
major cardiovascular events, and larger reductions in
bp produced larger reductions in the risk [3]. these
observations suggest that most of the differences
among treatment regimens in their effects on
cardiovascular outcomes could be explained by the
differences in achieved bp level. however, it may
also be true that some treatment regimen is superior
or inferior to others with regard to the risk reduction
of cardiovascular events [4].
 xxxg99xxx  (at ii), a physiologically active
major substance of the renin—angiotensin system
(ras), acts as a vasopressor by inducing
vasoconstriction and elicits water and sodium
absorption in the proximal renal tubule by stimulating
secretion of aldosterone [5]. thus, inhibition of
pathophysiological effects of at ii is considered
beneficial for the treatment of hypertension.

effects of at ii are mediated by binding of at ii
to the at ii receptors. four subtypes of at ii
receptors, at 1 , at 2 , at 3 and at 4 are known
although pathophysiological role of  xxxg2056xxx  and at4 in
humans is largely unknown. the  xxxg100xxx  exists
in the blood vessels, liver, kidneys, adrenal cortex,
and heart, and cardiovascular effects of at ii are
mainly mediated by this receptor [5, 6]. a
physiological role of the  xxxg101xxx  receptor is not well
understood; however, it also exists in the blood
vessels, kidneys, adrenal glands, heart, and brain,
and it is generally thought that the  xxxg101xxx  receptor may
have physiologically opposing effects on at 1
receptor-mediated actions [6, 7]. thus, selective
blockade of the  xxxg100xxx  by arbs (at ii type 1
receptor blockers) may allow free at ii to stimulate
unblocked at 2 receptors, providing possible
beneficial effects on cardiovascular systems [8].
arbs suppress the effects of at ii generated by
all pathways, including chymase, whose activity is
not inhibited by angiotensin converting enzyme
(ace) inhibitors (aceis). furthermore, arbs have
less adverse reactions; they are unlikely to cause
side effects such as  xxxd1861xxx  and angioedema
associated with aceis [9]. therefore, it is plausible
that inhibition of the ras by arbs may become a
promising strategy for the organ protection in
patients with hypertension [10-12]. there is
widespread agreement that the ras plays a pivotal
role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and
cardiovascular disease (cvd) in diabetes [10-12].

indeed, large clinical trials have demonstrated
substantial benefit of the blockade of this system by
aceis or arbs; they not only prevent the onset of
diabetes in hypertensive patients, but also reduce
the risk for cardiovascular and renal disease
progression in diabetic patients with hypertension
[10-12].
several types of arbs are commercially available
for the treatment of patients with hypertension.
among them, we have recently found that
 xxxd3303xxx  ( xxxd3303xxx  ® ) could have the strongest
binding affinity to at 1 receptor [13]. further,
 xxxd3303xxx  is reported to act as a partial agonist of
 xxxg1807xxx  ( xxxg1807xxx  ), although it does not have the potency of
glitazones [14]. in this review, we focused on
 xxxd3303xxx  and discussed its potential therapeutic
implication in insulin resistance and vascular
complications in diabetes.

affinity

of

several types of arbs are commercially available
for the treatment of hypertensive patients. however,
comparisons of the binding affinity to  xxxg100xxx 
among them remain to be elucidated. therefore, we
first examined the dissociation rate of several arbs
from  xxxg100xxx  in vitro. at ii time-dependently
dissociated  xxxd3303xxx , olmesartan, candesartan,
 xxxd3487xxx , losartan, and an active metabolite of
losartan, exp3174 from membrane components
containing human  xxxg100xxx ; the dissociation rate
constant of each arb was 0.003248, 0.004171,
0.005203, 0.009946, 0.01027, and 0.008561 min-1,
with corresponding half-lives (t1/2) of 213, 166, 133,
70, 67, and 81 min, respectively [13]. these results
demonstrate that  xxxd3303xxx  could have the
strongest binding affinity to  xxxg100xxx  among
various arbs examined here; the rank order of
affinity is  xxxd3303xxx  > olmesartan > candesartan >
exp3174 ≥  xxxd3487xxx  ≥ losartan. due to its high
potential at 1 receptor blocking ability and long
plasma half-life,  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg once daily was
superior to  xxxd3487xxx  80 mg once daily in reducing
diastolic bp during the last 6 h of the 24 h dosing
interval [15]. further, during the 18-24 h period after
dosing of  xxxd3303xxx  or losartan, the reductions in
systolic and diastolic bp with 40 mg or 80mg
 xxxd3303xxx  were each significantly greater than
those observed for losartan 50 mg, and losartamn
was no better than placebo [16]. these findings
indicated that  xxxd3303xxx  80 mg once daily produced
sustained 24-h bp control in mild-to-moderate
hypertensive patients which compared favourably
with  xxxd3487xxx  80 mg or losartan 50 mg.  xxxd3303xxx 
may also have superior cardioprotective properties in
patients with hypertension due to its long-lasting at1
receptor antagonistic ability. we have very recently
found that the cerebroprotective effects of
 xxxd3303xxx  in at ii-infused spontaneously
hypertensive rats stroke-prone (shr-sp) were

stronger than those of losartan although there was
no significant difference of bp levels between the
two groups [17]. cumulative neurological deficit and
death rates were significantly less in telmisartantreated group than in non-treated shr-sp. taken
together, these observations suggest that
endogenous ras activation could be involved in
neuronal cell damage in shr-sp and blockade of
the ras by  xxxd3303xxx  may become a promising
strategy for the treatment of high-risk stroke-prone
hypertensive patients.

beneficial aspects of  xxxd3303xxx  on
insulin resistance
the metabolic syndrome is strongly associated
with insulin resistance and consists of a constellation
of factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia
that raise the risk for cardiovascular diseases and
diabetes mellitus [18,19]. hypertension occurs
approximately twice as frequently in patients with
diabetes compared with in non-diabetic controls
[18,19]. conversely, recent data suggest that
hypertensive patients are more likely to develop
diabetes than normotensive persons [18,19]. these
observations suggest that insulin resistance and
hypertension coexist more often that would be
expected by chance. however, in some ethnic
groups, such as in pima indians and mexican
americans, a marked insulin resistance has not been
associated with an increase prevalence of
hypertension [20]. moreover, no differences in
plasma insulin levels were found between
normotensive and hypertensive micronesian,
polynesian and melanesian populations or the black
population in the seychelles [21]. in addition, in
other populations neither insulin resistance nor
hyperinsulinemia were related to hypertension in
patients with type 2 diabetes [20,21]. these findings
indicate that certain ethnic groups may not have the
association between insulin resistance and
hypertension most likely, thus suggesting that
genetic mechanisms and possibly environmental
factors also play a role that could override the
influence of insulin. whatever the underlying
mechanisms, the association of diabetes with
hypertension increases its risk of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality. up to 75% of cvd in diabetic
patients can be attributed to hypertension [18,19].
therefore, the primary goals of treating the metabolic
syndrome are prevention of type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular events.
recently,  xxxd3303xxx  was found to act as a partial
agonist of  xxxg1807xxx  [14,22,23]. molecular modeling
studies suggest that  xxxd3303xxx  might influence
 xxxg1807xxx  activity by interacting with regions of the
ligand-binding domain that are not typically engaged
by full agonists of the receptor [14]. furthermore,
none of the commercially available arbs were found
to activate  xxxg1807xxx  when tested at the
concentrations of therapeutic ranges [14,22,23].
 xxxd3303xxx  also induced  xxxg1807xxx  activity in at1

potential utility of  xxxd3303xxx 

receptor-deficient cell models, thus further supporting
the concept that  xxxd3303xxx  could stimulate  xxxg1807xxx 
activity independent of its  xxxg100xxx  blocking
actions [22,23].
 xxxg1807xxx  promotes differentiation of preadipocytes
by activating adipose-specific gene expression
[24,25]. indeed, rna interference of  xxxg1807xxx  using
fiber-modified adenovirus vector efficiently
suppresses preadipocyte-to-adipocyte differentiation
in 3t3-l1 cells [24]. mouse embryonic fibroblasts
that lack  xxxg1807xxx  are incapable of adipogenic
conversion [25]. further,  xxxg1807xxx  activity influences
the gene expression involved in carbohydrate and
lipid metabolism, and pioglitazone and rosiglitazone,
ligands for  xxxg1807xxx , improve insulin resistance in
diabetic patients [26]. moreover, there is a growing
body of evidence that activators of  xxxg1807xxx  exert
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative
effects on vascular wall cells, thus decreasing the
risks for atherosclerosis [26,27]. these observations
suggest that due to its unique  xxxg1807xxx -modulating
activity,  xxxd3303xxx  may become a promising
‘cardiometabolic sartan’, that targets both diabetes
and cvd in hypertensive patients [28].
human adipose tissue expresses all the
components of the ras [29]. at ii markedly inhibits
adipogenic differentiation of human adipocyts via
type 1 receptor [30]. further, expression of at iiforming enzymes in adipose tissue is inversely
correlated with insulin sensitivity [28]. these findings
suggest that  xxxd3303xxx  could promote the
recruitment and differentiation of adipocytes and
counteract the ectopic deposition of lipids in other
tissues (muscle, liver, pancreas) via the ppar-gammamodulating activity and ras blockade property,
thereby improving insulin sensitivity.
in vitro,  xxxd3303xxx  augmented glucose
transporter isoform 4 expression and 2-deoxyglucose
uptake both in basal and insulin-stimulated state of
adipocytes [31]. in animal study,  xxxd3303xxx 
administration caused a significant attenuation of
weight gain and reduced glucose, insulin, and
triglyceride levels in rats fed a high-fat, highcarbohydrate diet, compared with treatments of
losartan, another type of arb [14].  xxxd3303xxx 
treatment significantly decreased plasma levels of
glucose, insulin, triglycerides and non-esterified fatty
acid kk-ay mice, an obese type 2 diabetic animal
model [32]. further, recently,  xxxd3303xxx , but not
 xxxd3487xxx , promoted increases in caloric expenditure
in this model [33].  xxxd3303xxx  reduced the
accumulation of visceral fat and decreased
adipocyte size to a much greater extent than
 xxxd3487xxx , which was also associated with a
significant reduction in hepatic triglyceride content. in
addition,  xxxd3303xxx  treatment decreased the weight
of visceral adipose tissue and triglyceride content in
the liver and muscle, and increased serum
adiponectin levels with a concomitant improvement
of insulin resistance in diet-induced obese mice [34].
some investigators now believe that disordered fatty

acid/lipid metabolism and visceral obesity are the
primary factors driving insulin resistance and the
metabolic syndrome. the framingham study found
that hypertension in 70% of men and in 61% of
women was directly attributable to excess adiposity
(the main clinical feature of the metabolic syndrome)
[35]. these observations suggest that due to its
unique  xxxg1807xxx -modulating activity,  xxxd3303xxx  may
help protect against dietary-induced visceral obesity
and insulin resistance in patients with the metabolic
syndrome.
furthermore, recently, several clinical papers also
reported the insulin-sensitizing effects of  xxxd3303xxx 
in hypertensive patients [36-40].  xxxd3303xxx 
treatment resulted in a reduction in homeostasis
model assessment index (homa-ir) and glucose
area under the curve during intravenous glucose
tolerance in non-diabetic, insulin-resistant patients
[36]. moreover, high-dose treatment with  xxxd3303xxx ,
but not calcium channel blocker  xxxd2734xxx , was
reported to reduce serum insulin levels as well as
homa-ir in non-diabetic hypertensive subjects [37].
in this study, since  xxxd3303xxx  did not affect serum
adiponectin levels [37],  xxxd3303xxx  may improve
insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic essential
hypertensive patients by mechanisms apparently not
involving adiponectin induction. replacement of
 xxxd3487xxx  and candesartan by  xxxd3303xxx  in
hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes resulted
in a significant decrease in fasting insulin,
triglyceride, and high sensitive- xxxg520xxx 
levels [38]. serum adiponectin levels were also
increased by the treatment with  xxxd3303xxx . no
adverse effects such as weight gain and edema
were noted in the replacement by  xxxd3303xxx . in
addition,  xxxd3303xxx , but not losartan, significantly
reduced plasma glucose and insulin, homa-ir and
hba1c levels in hypertensive patients with the
metabolic syndrome [39]. these clinical observations
further support the concept that  xxxd3303xxx  could
retain the metabolic efficacy of  xxxg1807xxx  activation
with reduction in adverse effects in parallel at 1
receptor blockade. this may offer a new idea for the
treatment of cvd and insulin resistance in patients
with the metabolic syndrome by  xxxd3303xxx . ongoing
clinical trial (ontarget) has been designed the
efficacy of  xxxd3303xxx  with an acei, ramipril, alone or
in combination [40]. this randomized, double-blind,
multicenter international studies will provide further
information whether  xxxd3303xxx  can improve insulin
resistance and subsequently reduce the
development of diabetes and cvd in high-risk
hypertensive patients.

beneficial effects of the ras
inhibition by  xxxd3303xxx  on diabetic
microangiopathy
diabetic retinopathy is one of the most important
microvascular complications in diabetes and is a
leading cause of acquired blindness among the
people of occupational age [41]. the prevalence of

466

current molecular medicine, 2007, vol. 7, no. 5

diabetic retinopathy increases with duration of
diabetes. after 30 years of diabetes, nearly all
patients in the former group have some degree of
retinopathy and the prevalence of proliferative
retinopathy is about 60%.
the lesions of diabetic retinopathy can be
grouped into those associated with background,
preproliferative and proliferative retinopathy. the
earliest histopathological hallmark of diabetic
retinopathy is loss of pericytes [41]. normally, the
ratio of endothelial cells (ecs) to pericytes in the
retinal capillaries is 1:1, but its levels are reported to
decrease to 1:4 after several years of diabetes and
eventually to 1:10 with even longer diabetic
exposure. in parallel with loss of pericytes, several
characteristic changes including thickening of the
basement membrane, hyperpermeability, and
formation of microaneurysm are observed [41].
these structural and functional abnormalities are
followed by microvascular occlusion in the retinas,
which ultimately progresses to proliferative changes
associated with neovascularization [42]. it has been
postulated that many of these changes are the
consequent of the loss of pericytes.
pericytes are elongated cells of the mesodermal
origin, wrapping around and along ecs of small
vessels [42]. as pericytes contain contractile muscle
filaments on their ec side, they have been regarded
for a long time just as microvascular counterparts of
smooth muscle cells, and implicated in the
maintenance of capillary tone [42]. in 1983,
d ’ amore developed a procedure for isolating
pericytes from small vessels, and enabled us to
elucidate the functional roles and biological
characteristics of pericytes [43]. by using pericyte-ec
co-culture systems, we have found that pericytes not
only regulate the growth, but also preserve the
prostacyclin-producing ability and protect against
lipid-peroxide-induced injury of ecs, thus playing an
important role in the maintenance of microvascular
homeostasis [43-46]. therefore, the loss of pericytes
could predispose the vessels to angiogenesis,
thrombogenesis, and ec injury, leading to full-blown
clinical expression of diabetic retinopathy. further,
recently, hammes et al. showed that retinal capillary
coverage with pericytes was crucial for the survival of
ecs, particularly under stress conditions such as
diabetes, and that pericyte deficiency leads to
reduced inhibition of ec proliferation, thus promoting
angiogenesis in the retinopathy of prematurity model
[47]. taken together, our in vitro and their recent in
vivo observations provide a basis for understanding
why diabetic retinopathy develops consequent to
pericyte loss, the earliest histopathological hallmarks
of diabetic retinopathy.
the local ras is activated under diabetes [48].
we have recently found that at ii stimulates
intracellular reactive oxygen species (ros)
generation in retinal pericytes through an interaction

endothelial growth factor (vegf) mrna levels in
pericytes, both of which were blocked by treatment
with  xxxd3303xxx  or an anti-oxidant,  xxxd68xxx 
[49,50]. these results suggest that at ii-type 1
receptor interaction could induce pericyte loss
through intracellular ros generation, thus being
involved in diabetic retinopathy, and that  xxxd3303xxx 
could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of early diabetic retinopathy.
vegf is a specific mitogen to ecs, also known as
 xxxg2413xxx , and is thought a pivotal
factor in the pathogenesis of proliferative diabetic
retinopathy. indeed, some clinical observations have
demonstrated that vegf level in ocular fluid is
positively correlated with the activity of
neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy [51].
recently, vegf level was also found to be
associated with the breakdown of the blood-retinal
barrier, thus being involved in microvascular
hyperpermeability in background retinopathy [52].
these observations suggest that  xxxd3303xxx  might
play a protective role against the development and
progression of diabetic retinopathy by blocking
vegf overexpression in pericytes as well.
diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of endstage renal disease, and accounts for disabilities
and the high mortality rate in patients with diabetes
[53]. development of diabetic nephropathy is
characterized by glomerular hyperfiltration and
thickening of glomerular basement membranes,
followed by an expansion of extracellular matrix in
mesangial areas and increased urinary albumin
excretion. diabetic nephropathy ultimately
progresses to glomerular sclerosis associated with
renal dysfunction [54]. further, it has recently been
recognized that changes within tubulointerstitium,
including proximal tubular cell atrophy and
tubulointerstitial fibrosis, are also important in terms
of renal prognosis in diabetic nephropathy [55].
such tubular changes have been reported to be the
dominant lesion in about one third of patients with
type 2 diabetes [55]. it appears that both metabolic
and hemodynamic factors interact to stimulate the
expression of cytokines and growth factors in
glomeruli and tubules from the diabetic kidney [55].
evidence has implicated the transforming growth
factor-beta (tgf-beta) system as a major etiologic agent in
the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis and
tubulointerstitial fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy [5457].
there is a growing body of evidence to suggest
that that the ras plays an important role in the
regulation of glomerular hemodynamics and renal
expression of cytokines, thus being involved in
glomerular hyperfiltration and mesangial expansion
in diabetic nephropathy [58]. at ii stimulates tgf-beta
expression in mesangial cells as well, which may
contribute to the development of glomerular sclerosis
in diabetes [59]. recently,  xxxd3303xxx  was found not
inferior to enalapril in providing long-term
renoprotection in persons with type 2 diabetes, mild-

to-moderate hypertension and albuminuria [60]. in
the diabetics exposed to  xxxd3303xxx  and enalapril
(detail) study, which was designed to compare the
long-term renal outcome of treatment with  xxxd3303xxx 
40 or 80 mg versus enalapril 10 or 20 mg in patients
with type 2 diabetes, the change in the glomerular
filtration rate after five-year treatment was -17.5 ml
per minute per 1.73 m2 in the  xxxd3303xxx -treated
subjects, as compared with -15.0 ml per minute per
1.73 m2 in the enalapril-treated subjects [60].

blockade by  xxxd3303xxx  of the
advanced glycation end producttheir receptor (age-rage) system
reactive derivatives from non-enzymatic glucoseprotein condensation reactions, as well as lipids and
nucleic acids exposed to reducing sugars, form a
heterogeneous group of irreversible adducts called
“ages”. ages were originally characterized by a
yellow-brown fluorescent color and by an ability to
form cross-links with and between amino groups [61],
but the term is now used for a broad range of
advanced products of the glycation process (also
called the “maillard reaction”), including ncarboxymethyllysine and pyrraline, which show
neither color nor fluorescence and do not cross-link
proteins [62].
ages are formed by the maillard process, a nonenzymatic reaction between reducing sugars and the
amino groups of proteins that contributes to the
aging of proteins and to the pathological
complications of diabetes [61-63]. the formation of
ages in vitro and in vivo is dependent on the
turnover rate of the chemically modified target, the
time available, and the sugar concentration. in the
hyperglycemia elicited by diabetes, this process
begins with the conversion of reversible schiff base
adducts to more stable, covalently-bound amadori
rearrangement products. over the course of days to
weeks, these amadori products undergo further
rearrangement reactions to form the irreversiblybound moieties known as ages.
a variety of molecular mechanisms underlying the
actions of ages and their contribution to cvd have
been proposed [62-65]. ages formed on the
extracellular matrix results in decreased elasticity of
vasculatures, and quench  xxxd2738xxx , which could
mediate defective endothelium-dependent
vasodilatation in diabetes [66]. age modification of
low-density lipoprotein (ldl) exhibits impaired
plasma clearance and contributes significantly to
increased ldl in vivo, thus being involved in
atherosclerosis [67]. binding of ages to rage
results in generation of intracellular ros generation
and subsequent activation of the redox-sensitive
transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx  in vascular wall cells, which
promotes the expression of a variety of
atherosclerosis-related genes, including intercellular
adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion
molecule-1,  xxxg357xxx ,

current molecular medicine, 2007, vol. 7, no. 5

467

plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,  xxxg748xxx ,
vegf, and rage [68-73]. ages have the ability to
induce osteoblastic differentiation of microvascular
pericytes, which would contribute to the development
of vascular calcification in accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes as well [74].
the interaction of the ras and age-rage
system has also been proposed. we have found
that at ii potentiates the deleterious effects of
ages on pericytes by inducing rage protein
expression [75]. in vivo, age injection stimulated
rage expression in the eye of spontaneously
hypertensive rats, which was blocked by  xxxd3303xxx .
in vitro, at ii-type 1 receptor-mediated ros
generation elicited rage gene expression in retinal
pericytes through  xxxg1559xxx  activation. further, at ii
augmented age-induced pericyte apoptosis, the
earliest hallmark of diabetic retinopathy. further, we
have recently found that  xxxd3303xxx  blocks the at iiinduced rage expression in ecs as well [76].
 xxxd3303xxx  could decrease endothelial rage levels
in patients with essential hypertension. taken
together, these observations provide the functional
interaction between the age-rage system and the
ras in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular
complications, thus suggesting a novel beneficial
aspect of  xxxd3303xxx  on these devastating disorders.
further, we have very recently found that
 xxxd3303xxx , but not candesartan, another arb,
down-regulated rage mrna levels in a dosedependent manner [77].  xxxd3303xxx  decreased
basal as well as age-induced rage protein
expression in hep3b cells. furthermore,  xxxd3303xxx ,
but not candesartan, dose-dependently inhibited the
age-induced ros generation and subsequent crp
gene and protein induction in hep3b cells [77]. an
anti-oxidant, n -acetylcysteine, a g l u t a t h i o n e
peroxidase mimics, ebselen, or an inhibitor of
nadph oxidase, diphenylene iodonium, blocked the
age-induced up-regulation of crp mrna levels in
hep3b cells as well. age increased  xxxg1559xxx  promoter
activity and curcumin, an inhibitor of nf-kappa b ,
decreased crp mrna levels in age-exposed
hep3b cells.  xxxd1216xxx , an inhibitor of  xxxg1807xxx ,
blocked the inhibitory effects of  xxxd3303xxx  on rage
expression and its down-stream signaling in hep3b
cells. in addition, troglitazone and ciglitazone, full
agonists of  xxxg1807xxx , modestly, but significantly,
suppressed rage mrna levels in hep3b cells, while
 xxxd1216xxx  alone increased them [77]. crp is an
acute phase reactant mainly produced by liver in
response to pro-inflammatory cytokines [78].
numerous studies have shown that crp is one of
the most powerful predictors for future cardiovascular
events [78]. in addition, crp elicits endothelial
dysfunction, pro-inflammatory reactions and vascular
smooth muscle cell proliferation, thereby directly
contributing to the development and progression of
atherosclerosis [78]. taken together, these
observations suggest that  xxxd3303xxx  could also
work as an anti-inflammatory agent against ages by
suppressing rage expression via  xxxg1807xxx  activation

in the liver and may play a protective role against
accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes.

perspectives
we reviewed here the potential therapeutic utility
of  xxxd3303xxx  in insulin resistance and vascular
complications in diabetes. the clinical relevance of
this unique ‘cardiometabolic sartan’ should be further
studied in patients with the metabolic syndrome
and/or diabetes. to develop novel therapeutic
strategies that specifically target insulin resistance
and cvd may be helpful for most patients with the
metabolic syndrome.
