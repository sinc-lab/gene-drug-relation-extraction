human chronic chagas disease cardiomyopathy (ccc) is an inflammatorydilated cardiomyopathy occurring years after infection by the protozoan
trypanosoma cruzi. the heart inflammatory infiltrate in ccc shows a 2:1
predominance of cd8+ in relation to cd4+ t cells, with a typical
th1-type cytokine profile. however, in vitro expansion of infiltrating t cells
from heart biopsy-derived fragments with interleukin-2 (il-2) and phytohaemagglutinin leads to the outgrowth of cd4+ over cd8+ t cells. we
hypothesized that survival cytokines, such as il-2,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15 might
be differentially involved in the growth and maintenance of heart-infiltrating and peripheral cd8+ t cells from ccc patients. we found that  xxxg1183xxx 
and il-15 were superior to il-2 in the expansion and viability of cd8+
t cells from both pbmc and heart-infiltrating t-cell lines from ccc
patients, and the combination of the three cytokines showed synergic
effects. heart-infiltrating cd8+ t cells showed higher expression of both
il-15ra and cc chain than cd4+ t cells, which may explain the improvement of cd8+ t-cell growth in the presence of il-2 +  xxxg1183xxx  + il-15.
immunohistochemical identification of il-15 and the higher mrna expression of il-15ra,  xxxg1183xxx  and cc chain in ccc heart tissues compared with
control individuals indicate in situ production of survival cytokines and
their receptors in ccc hearts. together, our results suggest that local production of  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15 may be associated with the maintenance and
predominance of cd8+ t cells, the cells effecting tissue damage in ccc
hearts.

introduction
chronic chagas disease cardiomyopathy (ccc) is the most
important clinical consequence of the infection by the
protozoan intracellular parasite trypanosoma cruzi, affecting
16–18 million individuals in latin america. t. cruzi
replicates in the cytoplasm of host cells and establishes a
chronic, low-grade, lifelong infection. ccc is an inflammatory-dilated cardiomyopathy that may lead to a fatal
course, affecting around 10–30% of infected individuals

5–30 years after the primary infection. the remaining
60–70% chronically t. cruzi-infected individuals remain
asymptomatic for many years. histopathologically, ccc is
characterized by a diffuse myocarditis with focal aspects; a
mononuclear infiltrate, intense heart fibre damage, prominent fibrosis and scarcity of t. cruzi parasites [1–3].
increased local expression of the cytokines ifn-c and
 xxxg2296xxx  [4, 5], interleukin (il)-6 and il-4 [5], as well as
hla class i and ii molecules and adhesion molecules has
been reported [6]. real-time pcr analysis showed that the

gene expression levels of ifn-c-inducible chemokines
 xxxg357xxx ,  xxxg559xxx  and mig, as well as the chemokine receptors  xxxg370xxx  and cxcr3, were selectively upregulated in
ccc heart tissue [7]. the heart infiltrate in ccc shows a
2:1 ratio of cd8+ over cd4+ t cells [2, 3, 5] and granzyme
a is detected in the heart lesions of ccc patients, suggesting a role for cytotoxicity in heart tissue damage [8]. it has
been observed that cd8+ t cells accumulate in the scarce
areas of heart tissue where t. cruzi is found [9]. recently,
we observed that cd8+ t cells derived from a heart-infiltrating t-cell line from a ccc patient were specific to
t. cruzi epitopes [10]. the factors leading to the accumulation of cd8+ t cells in ccc heart tissue are still unknown.
it can be hypothesized that survival cytokines, such as
il-2,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15, play a role in this phenomenon.
interleukin-2, il-15 and  xxxg1183xxx , are known to have effects
on cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell development, survival and function. il-15,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-2 bind to multimeric receptors
that share the common c chain (cc) subunit ( xxxg1176xxx ). each
cytokine, however, interacts with a unique, ligand-specific
a-chain receptor. il-2 and il-15 receptors also share a
b chain ( xxxg1175xxx ) and distinct associations of cytokine
receptor chains generate receptors with high or intermediate affinity for each cytokine [11]. even though il-15 and
il-2 share several properties, it is known that il-2 and  xxxg1165xxx  can have very distinct roles in t-cell biology [12, 13].
il-2 promotes t-cell activation and proliferation, and signalling through the  xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx ) complex may
also trigger the death or suppression of activated lymphocytes [14–16]. on the other hand, signalling through the
il-15r complex is necessary for the maintenance of memory cd8+ t cells and for nk-cell development [17, 18].
il-15 also exists as a membrane-associated cytokine and
the membrane il-15 ⁄ il-15ra can be internalized and
recycled back to cell surface promoting longer il-15 activity. this process may be involved in the long-term cd8+
memory t-cell survival [19]. it has been shown that the
maintenance of cd8+ naı̈ve t cells require t-cell receptor
(tcr) signalling through mhc and  xxxg1183xxx , whereas cd8+
memory t cells require il-15 or  xxxg1183xxx  [20–23].
considering the role of il-2,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15 in the
growth and maintenance of cd8+ t cells, in the present
study we investigated the involvement of such cytokines
and their receptors in the accumulation of cd8+ t cells
in ccc heart lesions.

materials and methods
pbmc and pbmc-derived t-cell lines. peripheral blood
samples of chagas disease patients with ccc were collected with anticoagulant (heparin or edta) for this study.
sample collection procedures have been approved by the
internal review board. mononuclear cells from heparinized peripheral blood samples were obtained by  xxxd3253xxx 
gradient centrifugation. thawed pbmc were resuspended

in dmem medium with 10% of the human serum.
viability was assessed and generally exceeded 90%. the
t-cell line from a ccc patient (p#12) was obtained from
pbmc stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha)
(5 lg ⁄ ml) and 106 feeder cells (50-gy irradiated pbmc)
in 1 ml of dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 2 mm of l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, mem’s non-essential amino acids and mem’s
vitamins (all from gibco, grand island, ny, usa),
50 lg ⁄ ml of gentamicin, 10 mm hepes buffer, 10% of
normal human serum (complete medium) plus 40 ui ⁄ ml
human recombinant interleukin-2 (proleukin il-2;
chiron, emeryville, ca, usa) in a humidified, 5% of
co2 atmosphere. after two rounds of expansion (10–
20 days), lymphoblasts were re-stimulated and cultured
in dmem 10% human serum supplemented with il-2
(100 ui ⁄ ml),  xxxg1183xxx  (5 ng ⁄ ml; peprotech, rocky hill,
nj, usa) and il-15 (5 ng ⁄ ml; peprotech) and stimulated by pha (sigma, st louis, mo, usa). cd8+ cells
were purified using magnetic beads attached to monoclonal antibody against human cd8 (m450; dynal, oslo,
norway). the beads were removed using detach-a-bead
antibodies (dynal). the resulting cd8+ t-cell line had
94% of cd8+ cells and 0.3% of cd4+ cells, the cd8),
pass-through t-cell line had 90.4% of cd4+ and 1.2%
of cd8+ cells and was referred as a cd4+ t-cell line.
heart-infiltrating t-cell lines. right ventricle endomyocardial biopsy fragments from 11 ccc patients were
minced and cultured in 96-well flat-bottom culture
plates in dmem (gibco, grand island, ny, usa) with
10% of inactivated human serum, supplemented with
40 u ⁄ ml il-2 (hoffman-la roche, nutley, nj, usa), in
the presence of autologous irradiated (50 gy) pbmc
(105 ⁄ well) as described [4]. lymphoblasts were later
expanded by two 15-day rounds of re-stimulation with
pha (2.5 lg ⁄ ml), 50-gy irradiated pbmc (106 ⁄ ml) in
complete medium plus 40 u ⁄ ml of il-2. after two to
three rounds of expansion, lymphoblasts were cultured in
dmem, 10% human serum supplemented by il-2
(100 u ⁄ ml),  xxxg1183xxx  (5 ng ⁄ ml) and il-15 (5 ng ⁄ ml) and stimulated by pha. no trypanosoma cruzi parasite growth
was observed during endomyocardial biopsy explant cultures, as detected by direct visualization of the highly
mobile trypomastigote forms.
immunohistochemistry for the detection of il-15 in the heart
lesion. fragments of myocardium of 15 ccc patients and
of four control individuals, without inflammatory cardiac
disease, were frozen in isopentane and maintained in liquid
nitrogen. sections (5 lm) of frozen myocardial fragments
were fixed in acetone and incubated with mouse anti-cd68
primary antibody (1:200) from dako-patts (glostrup,
denmark) to define macrophages or mouse anti-il-15
(1:100) from r&d. the secondary antibody was biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse igg (dako, ely, uk), diluted to
1:400 and incubated during 30 min at 37 c. the reaction

product was detected with avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex according to abc kit protocol (vector laboratories,
burlingame, ca, usa), and the reaction was developed
with diamino-benzidine (sigma). the negative control was
assessed by elimination of primary antibody. the slides
were counterstained with haematoxylin and eosin. cd68+
for macrophages or il-15+ mononuclear cells were counted
in 25 fields, 400· optical magnification. in the standardization of the anti-human il-15 antibody, we utilized
mononuclear cells of peripheral blood adhered in slides
and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), 10 lg ⁄ ml,
during 48 h.
flow cytometry assays. the surface phenotype of lymphoblasts was identified after immunostaining with monoclonal antibodies directed to the cd3, cd4, cd8, tcrab,
tcrcd, cd56, cd16 surface markers (bd biosciences,
san jose, ca, usa) labelled with fluorochromes and flow
cytometric analysis (facscan; becton-dickinson, san
jose, ca, usa). the phycoerythrin-conjugated (pe) antibodies against cd25 (il-2ra),  xxxg1175xxx  ( xxxg1175xxx ),  xxxg1176xxx 
(il- xxxd2159xxx ) were all purchased from bd pharmingen (san
diego, ca, usa). for il-15ra-chain staining, cells were
incubated with an il-15 mutant ⁄ fcc2a fusion that binds
to the a-chain [24], followed by staining with biotinylated goat anti-mouse igg antibody. cells were then washed
and stained with pe-streptoavidin. twenty thousand
events were collected and analysed on a facscan flow cytometer and cellquest software (becton-dickinson; biosciences). based on the characteristics of the forward and
side-scatter patterns, a gate was set on the lymphocytes
and the expression of  xxxg1175xxx  and il-15r chains was followed separately on cd3+cd4+ and cd3+cd8+ cells.
assessment of in vitro growth. t cells from long-term
pbmc or heart-infiltrating t-cell lines from ccc
patients (2 · 105 cells ⁄ well) were cultured with 1 · 106
irradiated pbmc plus pha (2.5 lg ⁄ ml) in the presence
of different cytokines: il-2 (100 iu ⁄ ml),  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15
(10 ng ⁄ ml) or their combination. fresh medium supplemented with cytokines was added every 3 days. to determine the survival and expansion of t cells, every
2–3 days from day 6, the numbers of viable cells were
estimated using trypan blue exclusion, and the cells were
re-suspended in fresh medium containing the corresponding cytokines.
long-term effects of cytokines on heart-infiltrating cd8+
t-cell growth. t-cell lines were established from endomyocardial biopsy of ccc patients and cultured in the presence
of human recombinant il-2 (100 lg ⁄ ml). after two to
three stimuli with pha (2.5 lg ⁄ ml), the lines were cultured in the presence of il-2 +  xxxg1183xxx  + il-15. the phenotype of t-cell line was monitored after two or more stimuli
with pha in the presence of il-2 +  xxxg1183xxx  + il-15.
real-time reverse transcriptase-pcr analysis. rna samples for the real-time reverse transcriptase (rt)-pcr
experiments came from explanted left ventricular free wall

heart samples obtained at transplantation from 11 ccc
(serological diagnosis and positive epidemiology) end-stage
heart failure patients and three non-failing donor hearts
from normal adult heart tissue not used for cardiac transplantation. the total rna was extracted using the trizol
method (life technologies inc., grand island, ny, usa).
the integrity of the rna was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. for cdna synthesis, 5 lg of total rna, 1 ll
oligodt (500 lg ⁄ ml), 1 ll dntp (10 mm of  xxxd1148xxx ,
dctp,  xxxd1837xxx  and dttp), depc water q.s.p. 12 ll, were
incubated for 5 min at 40 c in a 200-ll tube. later, 4 ll
transcription buffer 5x (tris-hcl 250 mm ph 8.3, kcl
375 mm, mgcl2 15 mm), 2 ll dtt 0.1 m, 1 ll inhibitor
rnase (40 u ⁄ ll) (rnase out; invitrogen, carlsbad,
ca, usa) and 1 ll super-script ii reverse transcriptase
(200 u ⁄ ll) (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca, usa) were added;
the reaction was heated for 50 min at 42c and 15 min at
70c. we designed forward and reverse primers for quantitative real-time rt-pcr using primer express (pe

results
phenotypic characterization of derived heart-infiltrating
t-cell lines from ccc patients grown on il-2

to investigate the expansion of heart-infiltrating t cells
by t-cell trophic cytokines, heart-infiltrating t-cell lines
were established culturing small fragments of heart tissue
biopsies from 10 ccc patients in the presence of il-2
and autologous pbmc-irradiated feeder cells. the average
±standard deviation of the percentage of cd3+ t cells
among these t-cell lines was 94.0 ± 5.1% and an overwhelming majority was tcrab+ (99.0 ± 0.4%). less
than 1% of cells were tcrcd+ or cd56+cd16+ (nk
cells). a predominance of 6:1 of cd4+ (74.6 ± 11.0%)
over cd8+ t cells (11.3 ± 10.4%) was observed. this is
in sharp contrast to the 0.5:1 cd4:cd8 t-cell ratios
found on direct immunohistochemistry analysis of ccc
endomyocardial biopsies [2, 3].
effect of  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15 on the expansion of cd8+ and
cd4+ t cells from pbmc-derived t-cell line from a ccc
patient

we thus compared the effect of il-15 and  xxxg1183xxx  with
il-2 on the expansion of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells from
t-cell lines obtained from a ccc patient. for that matter, we used isolated cd8+ and cd4+ t cells, obtained

from a pbmc-derived t-cell line from a ccc patient.
the cd8+ and cd4+ t-cell lines were stimulated with
pha and irradiated feeder cells plus il-2,  xxxg1183xxx , il-15
alone or in combination, and the cell growth was followed for 31 days. fresh culture medium with cytokines
was added twice a week. figure 1 shows that in the
presence of il-2 alone, the number of viable cd4+ t
cells was stable until 31 days after stimulation with
pbmc-irradiated cells plus pha. in contrast, the
growth of the cd8+ t-cell line was clearly reduced
15 days after stimulus, in comparison to cd4+ t cells
under il-2 alone (fig. 1). both cd4+ and cd8+ t
cells show increased expansion under  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15,
when compared with il-2 alone; while the combination
of il-2,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15 increased both expansion and
maintenance of viability over time.
expression of chains of  xxxg1175xxx  and cc chain on pbmc-derived
cd8+ and cd4+ t lymphocytes

we investigated whether the failure of il-2 to induce
the growth of long-term pbmc-derived cd8+ t cells
from a ccc patient was dependent on the differential
expression of  xxxg1175xxx  chains. for that matter, we evaluated
the kinetics of the expression of il-2ra (cd25),
il-2 ⁄ il-15rb ( xxxg1175xxx ) and cc chain ( xxxg1176xxx ) on the
pbmc-derived cd8+ and cd4+ t-cell lines cultured
with il-2, 15 days after the last stimulation with pha
and irradiated feeder cells. we observed that the median
of fluorescence intensities for il-2ra and cc chain were
substantially higher on cd4+ t cells than on cd8+ t
cells (fig. 2a). this pattern did not change at day 10
after pha stimulation (data not shown). similarly, we

figure 2 expression of  xxxg1175xxx  chains on cd8+ and cd4+ t cells from pbmc-derived t-cell lines from a chagas disease patient, cultured in
presence of il-2. cells from cd8+ and cd4+ t-cell lines (2 · 105) isolated from pbmc-derived t-cell line from a chagas disease patient were cultured with 106 irradiated allogeneic feeder cells and pha (2.5 lg ⁄ ml) in presence of il-2 (100 iu ⁄ ml). (a) the relative expression of il-2ra,
il-2 ⁄ il-15rb and cc on cd8 (shaded histogram) and on cd4 (solid line) t-cell lines were measured on day 0 by double stained with fitc or
pe-labelled antibodies to  xxxg1175xxx  chains and cd8 and cd4 detected by flow cytometry. (b) the percentage of positive cells to il-2ra, il-2 ⁄ il-15rb
and cc in cd8+ and cd4+ t-cell lines were measured on day 0 and 10 after pha stimulus and are represented by columns in the graph.

also observed that the percentages of il-2ra- and cc
chain-positive cells were much lower on cd8+ t cells
than on cd4+ t cells from the pbmc-derived t-cell line
from the ccc patient (fig. 2b).
effect of il-2,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15 on the expansion of
heart-infiltrating t-cell lines from chagas disease patients

after the observation that il-15, il-2 and  xxxg1183xxx  were
important for the long-term growth of peripheral cd8+
t-cell lines, we investigated the effect of the combination
of il-2 +  xxxg1183xxx  + il-15 on the expansion of heart-infiltrating t-cell lines from ccc patients. figure 3 shows the
growth curves of distinct heart-infiltrating t-cell lines
from five ccc patients, after pha and irradiated feeder
stimuli. although there was some interindividual variation of expansion levels, the combination of il-2,  xxxg1183xxx 
and il-15 promoted an increase in the number of viable
t cells in comparison to il-2 alone, visible on day 12
after stimulus in all t-cell lines.
differential expansion of cd8+ t cells from heart-infiltrating
t-cell lines from ccc patients in the presence of il-2, il-15
and  xxxg1183xxx 

to address whether il-15 and  xxxg1183xxx  were related with the
maintenance of cd8+ t cells in the heart infiltrate of chagas disease patients, we analysed the long-term growth of
heart-infiltrating t-cell lines from chagas disease patients

in the presence of il-2,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15. these heart-infiltrating t-cell lines were established initially with il-2
and autologous-irradiated feeder cells, and the average proportion of cd8+ t cells was 11.34%, ranging from 0.4%

and il-15 on the expansion of cd8+ t cells from heartinfiltrating t-cell lines from ccc patients is shown in
figure 4. half of the heart-derived t-cell lines showed an
increase in the proportion of cd8+ t cells (fig. 4; cd8+
t cells after expansion ⁄ cd8+ t cells before expansion ranging from 2 to 72).
in situ expression of il-15 on heart tissue from ccc patients

considering the importance of il-15 in the growth and
maintenance of cd8+ t cells from heart-infiltrating t-cell
lines and the predominance of cd8+ t over cd4+ t cell
in the heart infiltrate of chagas disease patients, we next
investigated the expression of il-15 in the endomyocardial
biopsies of 14 ccc patients. as il-15 can be secreted by
macrophages, the number of cd68+ macrophages was also
quantified in the same heart tissues. immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the cell infiltrates from chagas
disease patients have a significantly higher numbers of both
cd68+ cells and il-15+ cells when compared with the
hearts from control donors (fig. 5). the average number of
il-15+ cells ⁄ 400· field among ccc patients was 7.7 ±
10.1, compared with 0.48 ± 0.4 cells among control samples, a 16-fold difference (p = 0.01); the average number

were initially stimulated with 106 irradiated autologous pbmc plus

expression of il-2,  xxxg1183xxx , il-15 and their receptors on
intralesional t-cell lines and in the heart tissue from
ccc patients

considering that heart-infiltrating t-cell lines expanded
after long-term culture with a combination of il-2 +  xxxg1183xxx  + il-15, we investigated the expression of il-2 and
il-15 receptor chains in heart-derived t-cell lines. we
evaluated the surface expression of il-2ra, il-15ra and
il-2 ⁄ il-15rb and cc chain in cd8+ and cd4+ t cells
from heart-infiltrating t-cell lines from three ccc
patients, cultured with a combination of il-2,  xxxg1183xxx  and  xxxg1165xxx . at day 15 post-stimulus, the proportion of il-15ra+
and il-2 ⁄ il-15rb+ cells was higher on the cd8+ t cells
in all three heart-infiltrating t-cell lines than on cd4+ t
cells (fig. 6). however, no difference was detected in the
expression of il-2ra and cc chain on the cd8+ and cd4+
t cells in the same heart-infiltrating t-cell lines cultured
in the same conditions (fig. 6). in addition, the median of
fluorescence intensity of il-15ra was higher on cd8+ t
cells (9.5, 62.3 and 155.3 respectively) than on cd4+ t
cells (3.4, 3.2 and 5.42 respectively).
to assess whether il-2,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15 and their
receptors are also expressed in ccc heart tissue, we used
real-time pcr in heart tissue samples from 11 ccc
patients in comparison to heart tissues from three noninflammatory heart diseases. figure 7 shows that the

discussion
in the present work, we showed that the combination of
il-15,  xxxg1183xxx  and il-2 promoted the in vitro expansion of
cd8+ t cells from both pbmc-derived and heart-infiltrating t-cell lines from ccc patients. such expansion
might be dependent on the selective expression of
il-15ra, and cc chain on cd8+ t cells from heart-infiltrating t-cell lines. accordingly, higher heart tissue
expression of il-15ra, il-15, and  xxxg1183xxx  was observed in
ccc patients. our results are consistent with the idea
that the accumulation of cd8+ t cells in the heart infiltrate of ccc patients may be dependent on the local production of il-15 and  xxxg1183xxx .
the finding that  xxxg1183xxx  and ⁄ or il-15 can rescue the
proliferation and maintenance of the viability of il-2-cultured cd8+ t cells from a pbmc-derived t-cell line
from a ccc patient suggests that they play a major role
in the in vitro growth of cd8+ t cells (fig. 1). in accordance with our results, it has been shown by others that
 xxxg1183xxx  [27, 28] and il-15 [29] preferentially expand the
cd8+ t-cell population. the mechanisms by which
il-15 may contribute to the maintenance of memory
t cells are not fully understood. it has been shown that
the cell surface il-15ra ⁄ il-15 complex can undergo
endosomal internalization, survive lysosomal degradation
and recycle to the cell surface [19], contributing to the
long-term survival of cd8+ memory t cells. in our system, while a proliferative effect of  xxxg1183xxx , il-15 or their
combination with il-2 was obvious in the first 2 weeks,
until the peak of growth, we cannot ascertain whether
increased proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis or both
were operative during the last 2 weeks of the culture,
where the cell numbers were stable or decreased. the finding that cd8+ t cells from a pbmc-derived t-cell line

from a ccc patient express less il-2ra and cc than
cd4+ t cells (fig. 2) could partially explain the relative
refractoriness of cd8+ t cells to il-2 (fig. 1), in line
with the published findings [30–32]. moreover, the finding that cd4+ t cells from the pbmc-derived t-cell line
also increased in numbers after incubation with  xxxg1183xxx ,
il-15 or il-2 +  xxxg1183xxx  + il-15 in comparison to il-2 alone
(fig. 2) is also in line with the published literature [33].
the combination of il-2 +  xxxg1183xxx  + il-15 also preferentially expanded cd8+ t lymphocytes from intralesional
t-cell lines (fig. 4). in addition, we have also shown that
cd8+ t lymphocytes from the three distinct intralesional
t-cell lines present higher expression of the il-15ra and
il-2 ⁄ il-15rb, when compared with cd4+ t lymphocytes (fig. 5) as observed by others [19, 30]. this is consistent with the selective in vitro growth of the heartinfiltrating cd8+ t lymphocytes in the presence of il-2 +
 xxxg1183xxx  + il-15 by a receptor-driven mechanism. the mechanism of increased responsiveness to il-15 observed
among heart-infiltrating cd8+ t cells (increased il-15ra
and cc) seems thus to be distinct from that of
pbmc-derived cd8+ t cells, which showed reduced
il-2ra and cc expression instead (fig. 2). we cannot
exclude that the refractoriness to il-2 observed among
heart-infiltrating t cells could be due to distinct posttransductional signalling of il-2.
the finding of increased mrna expression of
il-15ra and cc in the cd8+ t-cell rich ccc myocardial
tissues (fig. 7) is in line with the surface expression data
on heart-infiltrating t-cell lines (fig. 6), suggesting that
in situ t cells effectively express such receptors in vivo.
the observation of increased levels of  xxxg1183xxx  mrna
(fig. 7) and an increased number of il-15+ cells, in the
hearts from ccc patients (fig. 5), indicates that both
 xxxg1183xxx  and il-15, ligands for the above-mentioned receptors, are indeed expressed in the ccc heart tissue. the
finding that il-15 mrna was expressed at similar levels
in control and the ccc heart tissue was in conflict with
the increased expression of immunologically detectable
il-15 protein in the ccc heart tissue. nevertheless, it
has been reported that il-15 mrna is constitutively
expressed in many tissues, and its regulation is mainly
post-transcriptional [19, 34]. together, our results are
consistent with locally produced  xxxg1183xxx  and il-15 being
major growth factors for cd8+ t lymphocytes in ccc
heart tissue.
 xxxg1165xxx  has also been identified as an important mediator in several chronic inflammatory diseases
[34–40]. il-15 can synergize with the il-12 for ifn-c
production [41], and il-15 synergizes with  xxxg1183xxx  to
enhance the ability of antigen-specific cd8+ and cd4+
t cells to produce ifn-c [42]. moreover, ifn-c itself
induces the expression of il-15 [34]. the finding that
the ratio of il-15+ ⁄ cd68+ cells is increased in ccc
heart tissue suggests that more cd68+ macrophages are

induced to produce il-15, possibly due to the inflammatory milieu. it is thus likely that the locally expressed
il-15, possibly produced by cd68+ macrophages, may
contribute to the increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as ifn-c and  xxxg2296xxx , observed in
ccc heart tissue [4, 5].
taken together, our results suggest that the accumulation of cd8+ t cells in the heart tissue of ccc patients
may be due, at least in part, to the local expression of
survival cytokines, possibly induced by ifn-c.  xxxg1183xxx  and
il-15 which may act on cd8+ cells bearing specific cytokine receptors, allowing their selective growth, survival
and maintenance. their ongoing production of ifn-c
could in turn upregulate local production of il-15, in a
positive feedback loop. furthermore, this mechanism
would lead to the maintenance of th1-type inflammatory
cells in heart tissue. whether such granzyme+cd8+ t
cells have a role in heart tissue damage in ccc, or are
merely a collection of exhausted t cells remains to be
established.
