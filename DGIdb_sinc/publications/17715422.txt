the selegiline transdermal system is a  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitor that was recently approved by the us food
and drug administration for the treatment of major
depressive disorder. the current study was conducted
during the selegiline transdermal system development
program to characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics
and absolute bioavailability of selegiline administered by
the 6-mg/24-h selegiline transdermal system in healthy
volunteers. selegiline transdermal system results were
compared with those obtained after a single 10-mg oral
dose of selegiline hcl. the selegiline pharmacokinetics
differed greatly between the 2 routes of administration.
transdermal selegiline administration reduced metabolism

and produced a high, sustained plasma selegiline concentration over the dosing period, with an absolute bioavailability of 73%. by contrast, oral dosing produced a sharp
plasma selegiline peak that occurred within 1 hour and
declined rapidly, with an absolute bioavailability of 4%.
the data provide the basis for therapeutic advantages of
the selegiline transdermal system in administering antidepressant doses of selegiline.

the treatment of late-stage parkinson disease.2,3 at the
approved oral dosage of 5 mg twice daily, selegiline
is a preferential inhibitor of mao-b and does not
require dietary restrictions that are generally
imposed on nonselective mao inhibitors (maois).4-6
dietary modifications are necessary during treatment
with the traditional, nonselective maois to avoid the
risk of hypertensive crisis following the ingestion of
foods containing high concentrations of tyramine.7,8
tyramine is an indirect-acting sympathomimetic that
has the potential to cause an acute elevation in blood
pressure following its systemic absorption, resulting
in hypertensive crisis and damage to the central nervous system (cns) (eg, stroke).7,9 mao-a acts as an
intestinal barrier to the systemic absorption of dietary
tyramine.4,10

pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of selegiline

small, published clinical trials have also demonstrated the potential use of selegiline as an antidepressant therapy; however, the oral doses required
for this therapeutic effect are 3 to 6 times greater
than those approved for the treatment of parkinson
disease.11-13 at these higher, off-label, oral doses,
selegiline no longer maintains selective inhibition of
mao-b at peripheral tissue sites and, with the additional inhibition of mao-a in the intestinal mucosa,
carries the risk of hypertensive crisis associated with
dietary tyramine ingestion.6,14
recently, a transdermal formulation of selegiline
(selegiline transdermal system [sts] [1 mg selegiline/ 1 cm2]) has been approved as a once-daily treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd). the sts
is manufactured in doses of 6, 9, and 12 mg/24 h.
the sts was developed to avoid the extensive rate
of first-pass metabolism (>90%) of orally administered selegiline. in this regard, selegiline is metabolized by a variety of cytochrome p450 hepatic
pathways to n-desmethylselegiline, r(–)-methamphetamine, and r(–)-amphetamine. accordingly, the
sts permits administration of the required high
antidepressant concentrations of selegiline to the
cns while maintaining the intestinal barrier to
dietary tyramine, thus avoiding the risk of tyramineinduced hypertensive crisis. the preferential effects
of transdermally administered selegiline on cns
mao-a and mao-b inhibition have been demonstrated in animal studies.15,16 in addition, the
absence of a clinically meaningful increase in the
cardiovascular sensitivity to orally administered
tyramine has been demonstrated in human pharmacology studies conducted with the 6-mg/24-h sts.17
the 6-mg/24-h sts has demonstrated antidepressant efficacy as both acute18,19 and maintenance therapy.20 accordingly, these clinical safety and efficacy
data have supported the approval of the 6-mg/24-h
sts by the us food and drug administration (fda)
for treatment of mdd without dietary modifications.
however, because of limited safety data, the 9- and
12-mg/24-h doses of the sts require the adherence
to a modified tyramine diet.
the current study was conducted during the sts
development program to characterize the singledose pharmacokinetics (pk) and absolute bioavailability of selegiline administered by the 6-mg/24-h
sts in healthy volunteers. selegiline bioavailability
was based on the intravenous (iv) administration of
selegiline hcl (10 mg/24 h) as the reference standard.
the selegiline pk and relative exposure obtained following treatment with the sts were also compared

pharmacokinetics

with those obtained after a single 10-mg oral dose of
selegiline hcl.
materials and methods
this study was conducted at a single center (ppd
development, austin, texas) in compliance with all
applicable country or local requirements for the conduct of clinical trials, including those outlined by
the international conference on harmonization (ich),
consolidated guidelines on good clinical practice,
and the fda (21 cfr parts 50, 56, and 312). an
independent institutional review board (research
consultants review committee, austin, texas)
approved the protocol, and written informed consent
was obtained from each subject prior to initiation of
study procedures.
materials
the sts (1 mg selegiline/1 cm2 patch; emsam) was
manufactured by mylan technologies (st albans,
vermont) and supplied in a delivered dose of 6
mg/24 h (20-cm2 patch). selegiline hcl 5-mg capsules (eldepryl) were supplied by somerset
pharmaceuticals inc (tampa, florida). the iv selegiline hcl infusion solution (10 mg/l 0.9% nacl) was
prepared at the clinical site (ppd development,
austin, texas) by a registered pharmacist, documenting preparative methods, analytical accuracy,
negative pyrogenicity, and positive sterility.
examination of the preinfusion values (time 0)
revealed an overall mean recovery value of 98.5%,
confirming the accuracy of the formulation.
study design
this was a randomized, open-label, single-center,
single-dose, 3-way crossover study. each subject was
randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups (see below).
treatment periods consisted of a single sts (6 mg/
24 h; 20-cm2 patch), a single 10-mg selegiline hcl dose
(two 5-mg selegiline hcl capsules; 8.37 mg selegiline),
or an iv infusion of selegiline hcl (10 mg/24 h; 0.7
ml/min; 8.37 mg/24 h selegiline). an interval of
8 days was maintained between each treatment
period. subjects were confined to the study site for
5 days during each treatment period. blood and
urine samples were drawn at scheduled times to
assess concentrations of selegiline and its metabolites. the study was performed without tyramine
dietary restrictions.

application), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 24.5,
26, 28, 30, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours after dosing;
oral selegiline hcl treatment: 0 predose (within 30
minutes prior to dose), 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4,
6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 hours after dosing; and

12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 24.5, 26, 28, 30, 36, 48, 72, and 96
hours after dosing.

blood samples (7 ml) were drawn through an
indwelling catheter from the arm contralateral to the
site of sts application or the 10-mg selegiline hcl iv
infusion. each subject had a total of 57 blood samples
taken and a minimum of 300 ml of blood drawn for the
assay of plasma selegiline and its major metabolites.
all blood samples were drawn into an evacuated
glass tube containing  xxxd2267xxx   xxxd3214xxx  and centrifuged (rcf = 1315). immediately after centrifuging,
the plasma was transferred to polypropylene tubes
and stored at or below –20°c. plasma samples were
shipped frozen to phoenix international life
sciences inc (montreal, quebec, canada) for analysis of selegiline and each of its major metabolites
(see below).
for the determination of urine concentrations of
selegiline and its metabolites, 0- to 24-hour urine
samples were collected in a polypropylene container over a 5-day collection period from each volunteer at the following times during the study: –24
to 0 (predose), 0 to 24, 24 to 48, 48 to 72, and 72 to
96 hours relative to 0-hour drug administration.
subjects were instructed to provide a complete 24hour specimen. sample collection times of the first
and last voids for each 24-hour collection were
recorded. collected urine samples were stored at 4°c
(refrigerated) for the full 24-hour collection period.

pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of selegiline

upon completion, the volume excreted and ph values were recorded. a 50-ml aliquot of each 24-hour
urine collection was obtained, frozen at or below
–20°c, and then shipped for analysis (phoenix
international life sciences inc; see below).
dosing solution (iv) and patch residual
concentrations
samples (2 ml) of the final iv selegiline hcl dosing solution were obtained immediately prior to
administration and at the end of the 24-hour infusion period to calculate the actual dose administered to each subject and to ensure the stability of
the preparation over the 24-hour period, respectively. to determine the dose of selegiline administered by the transdermal route, each transdermal
patch (sts) was collected following the 24-hour
dosing period and returned to its original pouch for
residual selegiline determination. all infusion
aliquots and collected stss were properly labeled,
frozen at or below –20°c, and shipped for selegiline
analysis (ppd development, middleton, wisconsin;
see below).
analytical methodology
plasma and urine samples were assayed for selegiline and its 3 major metabolites by phoenix
international life sciences inc, with a highly sensitive, validated assay using high-performance liquid
chromatography (lc) separation and tandem mass
spectrometry (ms) for detection (lc/ms/ms) and
amitriptyline as the internal standard. briefly, plasma
and urine samples were liquid/liquid extracted with
1-chlorobutane, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in methanol for analysis. the lc separation
was performed on a 33 × 4.6-mm (3 mum) lc-cn
analytical column (supelcosil) operated at room
temperature. the mobile phase was a mixture of
methanol, 0.025 m ammonium acetate, and water
(86:2:12, by volume), delivered at a flow rate of 1
ml/min. detection was performed using a sciex
ms/ms atmospheric pressure ionization spectrometer, in the multiple-reaction monitoring mode. the
following transition mass-to-charge ratios (m/z)
were monitored: 278.3 to 191.2 (internal standard,
amitriptyline), 188.3 to 91.1 (selegiline), 174.1
to 91.1 (n-desmethylselegiline), 150.2 to 61.1
(r(–)-methamphetamine), and 136.3 to 91.1 (r(–)amphetamine). the approximate assay calibration
range in plasma was 25 to 8000 pg/ml for selegiline,
50 to 15 000 pg/ml for n-desmethylselegiline, 100 to

pharmacokinetics

15 000 pg/ml for r(–)-amphetamine, and 100 to 15 000
pg/ml for r(–)-methamphetamine. interassay accuracy
was between 96% and 107%, and the interassay precision (expressed as the percentage coefficient of variation) was between 3.0% and 15.0% for all analytes.
aliquots of the iv selegiline hcl dosing solution
and the residual content of the transdermal selegiline patches, following the 24-hour subject application,
were assayed for selegiline by ppd development
(middleton, wisconsin) with a highly sensitive, validated assay using high-performance lc separation,
uv detection (205 nm), and selegiline hcl as the reference standard. briefly, sts patches or aliquots of
the iv selegiline hcl dosing solution were extracted
in methanol, sonicated, and diluted in mobile phase
to a theoretical concentration of 10 mug/ml selegiline.
the lc separation was performed on a 75 × 4.6-mm
(3.5 mum) mac-mod zorbax sb c-18 reverse-phase analytical column (agilent, chadds ford, pennsylvania)
operated at 35°c. the mobile phase consisted of a
mixture of 50 mm potassium phosphate (ph 3.5),
acetonitrile, and methanol (80:15:5 by volume),
delivered at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. detection was
performed with a uv detector (205 nm). selegiline
hcl was used as the reference standard at a concentration of 10 mug/ml and corrected for free base
equivalence. the area responses for the diluted
extracts and the reference standard were within the
validated range of the analytical method. each sample was assayed in duplicate and the average value
reported. interassay accuracy was between 99.6%
and 100.7%, and the interassay precision (expressed
as the percentage coefficient of variation) was
between 0.3% and 1.1%.
pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis
a noncompartmental approach was used for pk data
analysis. plasma and urine concentration data and
the estimated pk parameters from the 12 subjects
who completed all 3 treatment regimens were summarized using arithmetic means and percentage
coefficients of variation (%cvs). all computations
were made using actual sampling times. the following noncompartmental pk parameters were estimated from the plasma concentration profiles for
each subject: area under the plasma concentrationtime curve (auc0-24, auc0-t), calculated by the linear
trapezoidal rule; auc0-∞, calculated as auc0-t +
ct/kel; maximum plasma concentration (cmax) over
the entire sampling phase, directly obtained from the
experimental data of plasma concentration versus
time curves, without interpolation, over the dosing

sequence, subject within sequence, treatment, and
period effects (proc glm and proc mixed, sas

the sequence effect at the alpha = .10 level of significance.
the mean square error (mse) of the model was used
to evaluate the treatment and period effects at the

pharmacokinetics and absolute bioavailability of selegiline

pharmacokinetics
the selegiline mean plasma concentration-time profiles following treatment with each of the tested
routes of administration are shown in figure 1.
these data show that the selegiline concentrations
following sts treatment are qualitatively similar to
those observed during the iv infusion. both formulations produced high, sustained plasma selegiline
levels during the 24-hour period of exposure. by
contrast, during oral administration, selegiline concentrations rose to a sharp peak in the early portion
of the time profile and then fell rapidly over the
remaining measurement period.
the metabolite mean plasma concentration-time
profiles following treatment with each of the selegiline
formulations are shown in figure 2. the pattern of
selegiline metabolite formation was very similar during treatment with the sts or iv infusion. however,
following oral selegiline dosing, an earlier formation
of the metabolites was observed prior to and during
the time of the rapid decline in selegiline levels.
a summary of each of the parameters for selegiline and its metabolites is displayed in table iii. the
auc0-∞ for all analytes following the oral selegiline
dose was replaced with the auc0-t. failure to perform the auc0-∞ calculation was based on the inability to accurately determine the apparent elimination
rate constants (kel) of each analyte for the oral dose.
examination of the auc0-t values for selegiline
and its metabolites illustrates the extensive metabolism of selegiline when administered by oral dosing
compared with the iv and transdermal routes.
without dose normalization, the extent of selegiline
exposure during oral dosing was approximately 10
times less than observed during sts treatment and
approximately 22 times less than following iv infusion (see table iv for dose-normalized comparison).
in addition, a high value for the apparent oral selegiline clearance (cl/f) was observed. by contrast,
metabolite exposure was greatly reduced during sts
or iv dosing. the differences in the rate of selegiline
metabolism between administration routes were
demonstrated by the metabolite to parent (selegiline) drug auc0-t ratios (auc0-t m/p). an auc0-t m/p
ratio of approximately 2.3 or less was obtained
for n-desmethylselegiline, r(–)amphetamine, and

figure 1. mean plasma-concentration time profiles for selegiline. subjects were assigned numbers according to the order of
enrollment and randomized, in blocks of 4, to 1 of 3 treatment
groups according to a latin square design. each subject received
a single selegiline transdermal system (sts; 6 mg/24 h; 20-cm2
patch) in 1 treatment period, a single oral 10-mg selegiline hcl
dose (two 5-mg selegiline hcl capsules; 8.37 mg selegiline) in
another treatment period, and an intravenous (iv) infusion of
selegiline hcl (10 mg/24 h; 0.7 ml/min; 8.37 mg/24 h selegiline)
in the other treatment period.

r(–)methamphetamine after sts and iv administration compared with auc0-t m/p values ranging from
86 to 903 after oral administration.
examination of the auc0-t m/p ratios, mrt, and
the tlag of selegiline and its metabolites for the 3 formulations suggests that with each form of selegiline
delivery, r(–)methamphetamine was the major
metabolite formed, followed by r(–)-amphetamine
and n-desmethylselegiline. in addition, examination of the tmax, mrt, and tlag values suggests that the
metabolites were formed sequentially. during oral,
transdermal, and iv dosing, the order of plasma analyte appearance was selegiline, n-desmethylselegiline,
r(–)methamphetamine, and r(–)amphetamine.
the half-life (t1/2) of selegiline and its metabolites
after iv and sts dosing was similar and ranged from
15 to 25 hours. however, a shorter half-life was
observed after oral selegiline dosing (9-15 hours).
this shorter half-life was likely a function of the
lower concentrations of analytes and the inability to
accurately measure the kel of each analyte during the
terminal or “beta” phase of the elimination curve.

renal excretion did not contribute significantly to the
elimination of selegiline or its n-desmethylselegiline
metabolite. the average apparent excretion (%fe) of
selegiline and n-desmethylselegiline was <1% after
iv, oral, or sts administration. however, during the
period of urine collection (0-96 hours), significant
amounts of both amphetamine metabolites were
eliminated by renal excretion. in this regard, the
%fe values for r(–)amphetamine and r(–)methamphetamine were ~13% (11%-14%) and ~30%
(26%-33%), respectively, after iv and oral administration, and lower values (ie, ~7.2% for r(–)amphetamine and ~17.6% for r(–)methamphetamine) were
observed for both of these metabolites after sts
administration. for all treatments, renal clearance of
selegiline and n-desmethylselegiline (<1 l/h) was
low as compared with the glomerular filtration rate
of 7.50 l/h. by contrast, r(–)amphetamine and
r(–)methamphetamine exhibited renal clearance
values comparable with the glomerular filtration
rate for all treatments. the mean value for the urine
ph was 6.31 ± 0.35 and was within the normal range
of 4.5 to 8.0.

the assay results for the 24-hour residual content of
each of the worn transdermal patches (sts) were
used to calculate the apparent selegiline dose
administered to each subject. the amount of selegiline released (apparent dose administered expressed
as free base) from the sts ranged from 3.21 to 6.60
mg/24 h (mean, 4.78 ± 1.05 mg/24 h). the delivered
selegiline dose value was used for dose normalization of auc and cmax values in the calculation of
bioavailability for the sts. for iv and oral selegiline
dosing, the apparent dose administered as the free
base was 8.37 mg/24 h (the mean concentration for
the selegiline iv solution, 8.15 ± 1.27 mug/l, was
found to be 97.38% ± 15.22% of 8.37 mug/l).
accordingly, 8.37 mg/24 h was used for the dose
normalization calculation of pk values following iv
and oral selegiline dosing.
the least squares mean, dose-normalized pk
parameters (auc0-∞, auc0-t, and cmax), and the ratios
of treatment comparisons for selegiline are presented
in table iv. comparisons of the dose-normalized pk
values demonstrate the differences between the sts
and oral selegiline capsules regarding the relative
extent of exposure (auc) and cmax of selegiline.
in this regard, auc value ratios demonstrate that

the absolute selegiline bioavailability was determined from the apparent dose-normalized pk parameter ratios using iv dosing as the reference standard.
the absolute bioavailability of selegiline administered by the sts, based on auc0-∞ and auc0-t, was
73.7% and 73.4%, respectively, of the iv dosing.
the peak selegiline concentration (from the ratio of
the cmax values) was 83.6% of the iv route of administration. by contrast, the absolute oral selegiline
bioavailability (based on auc0-t) was only 4.4%, and
the peak concentration was 48.6% of iv dosing.
statistical comparisons (anova) of the data indicated a significant (p < .05) treatment effect for the
apparent dose-normalized pk parameters for selegiline and its metabolites. however, no significant
sequence effects were observed for any of the pk
parameters examined.
safety
a summary listing of adverse events (aes) that
occurred during the study is presented in table v.
seven (53.8%) of the 13 subjects reported a total of
10 aes. all the reported aes were considered to be
mild in severity, none required treatment, and all
aes resolved without sequelae. five (38.5%) of the
13 subjects reported a total of 6 aes considered by
the investigator to be at least remotely related to
study medication. no deaths, discontinuations due
to aes, or serious adverse experiences (saes) were
reported during the study period. finally, the results
of all clinical laboratory tests were unremarkable,
and vital signs remained within the normal range.
discussion
the sts was developed to achieve both mao-a and
mao-b inhibition in the cns while maintaining the
1264 • j clin pharmacol 2007;47:1256-1267

intestinal mao-a barrier to dietary tyramine.15,16 it
was hypothesized that transdermal delivery could
provide the necessary plasma selegiline concentration to obtain an antidepressant effect while avoiding
the overexposure of intestinal mao-a to the high
concentrations of selegiline that would be necessary
to achieve these same plasma concentrations during
oral treatment. transdermal products deliver drug
directly into the systemic circulation, ensuring maximal plasma concentrations and enabling a highly
lipophilic compound (such as selegiline) to rapidly
penetrate biological membranes and enter cns target
sites. indeed, the sts has proven to be an effective
antidepressant agent,18-21 which has obtained fda
approval for the treatment of mdd without the necessity for dietary modifications at the starting and target dose of 6 mg/24 h.17 although others have
previously studied the pk of orally administered
selegiline,22-27 the current study compares 3 different
routes of administration for selegiline and demonstrates the pk advantages of transdermal selegiline
administration over oral dosing.
the safety results of this study demonstrated that
selegiline was well tolerated regardless of the route
of administration. these safety findings are consistent
with previously published data showing that selegiline is safe and well tolerated when administered
within the range of approved oral or transdermal
doses.18-21,28,29 in contrast, the pk of selegiline differed greatly between the routes of administration.
selegiline administered by transdermal patch (sts)
produced a plasma selegiline concentration-time
profile that was qualitatively similar to iv infusion but
with a lower overall extent of exposure. however,
oral dosing produced a rapid peak in plasma selegiline
that occurred within 1 hour and rapidly declined
over the time course. in addition, the extent of oral
selegiline exposure was approximately 17 times lower

than observed during equivalent transdermal (sts)
dosing and approximately 22 times lower than
observed during the iv selegiline infusion. furthermore, peak selegiline concentration following sts
dosing was nearly 2-fold greater than that seen with
equivalent oral dosing.
the differences observed in the plasma selegiline
concentration-time curve following the oral and transdermal routes of administration are consistent with a
rapid absorption and high rate of first-pass metabolism
during oral selegiline dosing. a review of the dosenormalized auc0-t values for each of the selegiline
metabolites demonstrates that compared with oral
dosing, selegiline metabolite exposure was reduced by
approximately 50% during treatment with the sts. in
addition, the large metabolite/selegiline (m/p) ratio
that ranged from 86 to 903 after oral dosing was
reduced to ≤2.3 after treatment with the sts. finally,
the shorter tlag and tmax for each of the selegiline
metabolites, as well as the higher cl/f and lower
bioavailability observed with oral selegiline compared
with the sts, all support a high rate of first-pass
metabolism for selegiline during oral dosing. these
results are consistent with the work of others who
have reported a significant first-pass effect with orally
administered selegiline.22,23,26 furthermore, our results
are qualitatively similar to the early pk data in healthy
elderly male and female subjects reported by barrett

pharmacokinetics

et al23 and in young healthy male subjects reported by
rohatagi et al,30 both obtained with a prototype selegiline transdermal patch.
differences between administration routes were
also noted in the degree of variability (%cv)
observed in the selegiline pk data. oral dosing produced the highest degree of variability that was likely
related to the high rate of first-pass metabolism, the
limits of assay sensitivity, and the small number of
subjects studied. the avoidance of the first-pass
effect following dosing with the sts reduced the
variability in selgiline exposure by approximately
50%. data from other studies in the sts development program have demonstrated that this degree of
variability in selegiline exposure can be further
reduced by proper and consistent patch application.
thus, it suggests that transdermal delivery of selegiline also provides a more consistent exposure level
among individuals that may have clinical importance for safety and efficacy with this agent.
the data presented in this article clearly demonstrate that the selegiline metabolites were formed in
a sequential manner. moreover, although the extent
of metabolism was greatly reduced during sts or iv
treatment, the sequence of metabolite formation was
unaltered by route of administration. during sts,
iv, or oral dosing, r(–)-methamphetamine remained
the major selegiline metabolite, and the order of

1265

azzaro et al

metabolite appearance was n-desmethylselegiline,
r(–)-methamphetamine, and r(–)-amphetamine,
respectively (see tmax + tlag).
as expected, the renal clearance of selegiline and its
metabolites also remained unchanged regardless of
the route of administration. for all treatments, renal
clearance of selegiline and n-desmethylselegiline (<1
l/h) was low, suggesting that renal excretion plays a
minimal role in their elimination from the body. in
addition, the low renal clearance of these compounds,
as compared with the glomerular filtration rate of
7.50 l/h, suggests that both of these compounds are
subject to tubular reabsorption. these findings are consistent with selegiline being a weak base with a pka
of 7.5, a molecular weight of 187.3, and a calculated
octanol/water partition coefficient of 3.4.31 by contrast, r(–)amphetamine and r(–)methamphetamine
exhibited renal clearance values (7.3-8.7 l/h) that
were similar to the glomerular filtration rate. these
data, along with the moderate %fe values for the
amphetamine metabolites, suggest that renal excretion plays a primary role in their elimination.
a major objective of the present study was to
determine the absolute bioavailability of selegiline
when administered by the sts. the absolute oral
bioavailability of selegiline was also obtained for
comparative purposes. when the sts was examined,
the absolute bioavailability, based on dose-normalized
auc values, was approximately 73% of the iv selegiline dosing. by contrast, the absolute oral bioavailability of selegiline was only 4% of the iv selegiline
dosing. this low degree of absolute oral bioavailability was expected and consistent with the low
bioavailability values (≤10%) suggested by others.22,26
this low degree of absolute oral bioavailability is also
consistent with extensive first-pass clearance as
reported by others and confirmed in this study.22,23,26
a high rate of hepatic cytochrome p450-dependent
hepatic metabolism has been demonstrated for
selegiline and its metabolites.22,32,33 because of the
extensive first-pass metabolism, the plasma metabolite concentrations far exceed those of selegiline following its oral administration.
the necessity of administering high oral doses of
selegiline (30-60 mg/d)11-13 to patients with depression to achieve off-label antidepressant benefit is
clearly associated with the high degree of first-pass
metabolism and the limited systemic selegiline
exposure as revealed in this study. although the oral
dosing of selegiline has limited utility, the results of
the current study provide pk data that suggest clinical
advantages of administering selegiline by the transdermal route for the treatment of major depressive

1266 • j clin pharmacol 2007;47:1256-1267

disorder. selegiline administration by transdermal
patch (sts) avoids the first-pass effect and produces
high, sustained, and more consistent selegiline
exposure over a 24-hour dosing period, with an
absolute bioavailability of approximately 73%.
accordingly, the transdermal route of administration, which provides antidepressant concentrations
of selegiline to the cns by administering as little as
6 mg selegiline/24 h,18-20 should promote reliable
dosing and medication compliance and significantly
reduce exposure to the metabolites r(–)amphetamine
and r(–)methamphetamine. in addition, this method
of selegiline administration avoids the high degree
of gastrointestinal selegiline exposure necessary for
oral off-label antidepressant dosing that is associated
with significant gastrointestinal mao-a inhibition
and the risk of dietary tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis.6,14 in this regard, human tyramine challenge studies have demonstrated that a 6-mg/24-h
antidepressant dose of the sts is without meaningful changes in cardiovascular sensitivity to orally
administered tyramine.17
conclusion
we have examined the safety, single-dose pk, and
absolute bioavailability of selegiline when administered by the 6-mg/24-h sts. safety and pk data
obtained during treatment with the sts were also compared with a single oral selegiline dose and a 24-hour
iv selegiline infusion. the selegiline pk following dosing with the sts was quite similar to iv infusion but
very different from oral dosing. in this regard, the sts
avoids first-pass metabolism and produces a high, sustained plasma concentration of selegiline over a 24-hour
dosing period with an absolute bioavailability of approximately 73%. the selegiline pk differences between
sts and oral dosing provide the basis for therapeutic
advantages of the sts in administering antidepressant
doses of selegiline.
