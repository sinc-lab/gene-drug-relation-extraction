the antiepileptic effect of  xxxd2090xxx  (fbm) is ascribable to gating modification of nmda receptors. using
site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological studies, we found that single-point mutations of four
pairs of homologous residues in the external vestibule of the receptor pore, namely v644(nr1)-l643( xxxg965xxx )
(the two inner pairs) and t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx ) (the two outer pairs), significantly decrease fbm binding.
moreover, double mutations involving either the inner or the outer pair always show cooperative (nonadditive)
effects on fbm binding, whereas double mutations involving both inner and outer pairs always show additive
(noncooperative) effects. most interestingly, triple mutations of any three of the four critical residues essentially
abolish the effect of fbm. these findings indicate that t648(nr1)/t647( xxxg965xxx ) and v644(nr1)/
l643( xxxg965xxx ) act cooperatively to contribute directly to the “outer binding region” and “inner binding region”
in the fbm binding site, respectively. the outer and inner binding regions, however, seem to contribute
independently to fbm binding. we conclude that residues l643 and t647 in  xxxg965xxx  as well as homologous
residues v644 and t648 in nr1 are the major, and very likely the exclusive, molecular determinants
constituting the fbm binding site in the nmda receptor.
introduction
a

 xxxd2090xxx  (fbm; 2-phenyl- xxxd18xxx  dicarbamate) is
a potent new-generation anticonvulsant for different types of
seizures that are refractory to other anticonvulsants in both
children and adults.1–3 although it has been reported that fbm
may inhibit voltage-gated na+ channels4,5 and potentiate
 xxxd2177xxx  type a receptors,6–8 the major antiepileptic
effect of fbm at therapeutic concentrations seems to be at least
partly ascribable to inhibition of the n-methyl-d-aspartate
(nmda) receptor.7,9–11 fbm is shown to selectively bind to
nmda channels which are at the open and especially desensitized states rather than at the closed state.12,13 such selectivity
of fbm binding to the open/desensitized channels well explains
the use-dependent inhibition of nmda currents and consequently the nonsedative anticonvulsant effect of fbm. also,
fbm accelerates the activation kinetics of the nmda channel
and slows the recovery from channel desensitization.13 moreover, fbm modifies nmda channel gating via a one-to-one
binding stoichiometry (one fbm per nmda receptor) and has
quantitatively the same enhancement effect on nmda and
glycine binding to the nmda receptor.12 the gating-modification activities of fbm are similar to those of  xxxd2326xxx  (a
phenylethanolamine) which also has an activity-dependent
inhibitory effect on nmda currents.14,15 although structurally
different, both fbm and  xxxd2326xxx  seem to favor the confor* to whom correspondence should be addressed. tel: (886)-2-23123456

mational changes induced by nmda on the nmda receptor,
namely activation and desensitization.
it has been shown that the high-affinity binding site of
 xxxd2326xxx  is located in the amino terminal domain of  xxxg965xxx .14,16
however, the location and molecular determinants of the fbm
binding site in the nmda receptor remain largely unknown.
according to the general consensus on the topology of ionotropic glutamate receptors (nmda and non-nmda receptors),
each nmda receptor subunit has three transmembrane segments
(m1, m3, and m4), a reentrant loop (m2), an extracellular
n-terminus (the amino terminal domain or atd), and an
intracellular c-terminus (figure 1a; for a review see ref 17).
because fbm is an effective gating modifier, its binding site is
very likely located in or near the regions related to gating. more
recently, we found that fbm may act as an “opportunistic” pore
blocker modulated by extracellular proton, suggesting that the
fbm binding site is located at the junction of a widened and a
narrow part of the ion conduction pathway of the nmda
receptor.18 the prem1 and the c-terminal part of m3 (m3c)
presumably constitute the main part of the external vestibule
of the nmda receptor pore19,20 and are closely related to
channel gating.21–24 moreover, the atd and the prem1 have
been shown to play a critical role in receptor desensitization.25–27
in this study, we demonstrate that four residues in homologous
positions of m3c of  xxxg965xxx  (l643 and t647) and nr1 (v644
and t648) subunits are critical for fbm binding to the nmda
receptor. mutations of any three of the four residues would
essentially abolish fbm action on the receptor. these residues
may therefore constitute the major, and very likely the exclusive,
binding ligands in the fbm binding site in nmda receptors

room temperature (∼25 °c) with two-electrode voltage clamp (oc725c amplifier; warner instrument, hamden, ct). the microelectrodes, pulled from borosilicate capillaries and filled with 1 m kcl,
had resistances of 0.5 to 4 momega. oocytes were voltage-clamped at
a membrane potential of -70 mv and continuously perfused with
mg2+-free nd 96 solution (96 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 0.3 mm
bacl2, and 5 mm hepes, ph 7.6). cacl2 was replaced by bacl2
here to minimize ca2+-activated cl- currents. fbm (tocris
cookson, inc., bristol, uk) was dissolved in  xxxd1896xxx 
to make a 100 mm stock solution. nmda and glycine (sigma, st.
louis, mo) were dissolved in water to make 100 mm and 10 mm
stock solutions, respectively. the stock solutions were then diluted
into mg2+-free nd 96 solution to make 0.01–1 mm fbm, 0.1
µm-1 mm nmda, and 3 nm-30 µm glycine. the final
concentration of  xxxd1896xxx  (1% or less) was found to have
no detectable effect on nmda currents. the highest fbm
concentration used in this study was 3 mm, which is roughly its
maximal solubility in water, and was made by dissolving fbm
directly into mg2+-free nd 96 solution right before the experiment.
to study the apparent affinity (i.e., refs 9 and 10; see also ref 16)
of fbm, the concentration–response curves were fitted with the
hill equation

experimental section
molecular biology and expression of nmda receptors. the
rat cdna clones of nmda receptors used in this study are the
nr1a variant and the  xxxg965xxx  clone. the sequences of amino acid
residues in the nr1 and  xxxg965xxx  subunits are numbered from the
initiator methionine as in the original papers of nr1 and  xxxg965xxx ,
respectively.28,29 site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using
the quikchange kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca). to prepare double
mutations in the same subunit, cdna templates that already
contained one mutation were used for a second mutation. mutations
were verified by dna sequencing, and two independent clones for
each mutant were examined to ensure the lack of any inadvertent
mutations. the full-length capped crna transcripts were then
synthesized from each of nr1 and  xxxg965xxx  using t7 and t3
polymerases, respectively (mmessage mmachine transcription
kit, ambion, austin, tx). crna was stored in aliquots at -80
°c. to avoid the probability of formation of homomeric nr1
receptors, a mixture of nr1 and nr2 crnas in a ratio of 1:5 (i.e.,
0.1–4 ng of nr1 and 0.5–20 ng of nr2; see also ref 23) was
injected into xenopus oocytes (stages v-vi). oocytes were then
maintained in the culture medium (96 mm nacl, 2 mm kcl, 1.8
mm mgcl2, 1.8 mm cacl2, 5 mm hepes, and 50 µg/ml
 xxxd2193xxx , ph 7.6) at 18 °c for 2–3 days before electrophysiological studies. the culture medium was replaced daily.
electrophysiological recordings. oocytes were placed in a
small working-volume (<20 µl) perfusion chamber (opc-1,
automate scientific, inc., san francisco, ca) that is optimized
for fast solution exchange. the nmda currents were recorded at

(1)

where i is the nmda current in the presence of fbm, imax is the
maximum nmda current, [fbm] is the fbm concentration, kapp
is the apparent affinity of fbm binding to the receptor, and nh is
the hill coefficient. kapp thus would be equal to the ic50 when the
nh is 1. for mutations displaying mean relative currents >60% at
the highest fbm concentration tested (3 mm), the kapp values of
fbm could only be rough estimates and are likely to be underestimated (see the results).
data analysis and homology modeling for the pore region of nmda receptors. data were acquired using the digidata1322a analog/digital interface with pclamp software (axon
instruments, foster city, ca). the sampling rates were 0.5–1 khz,
and all statistics are given as mean ( sem. for comparisons
between experimental groups, the student’s t test was used, and p
< 0.01 was considered to be statistically significant. we also
constructed a homology model of the nmda receptor pore based
on the sequence alignment of the alternating nr1 (s553-r659) or
 xxxg965xxx  (f550-e658) subunit and the subunit of the mthk (1lnq)
 xxxg1232xxx .30 an nr1-nr1-nr2-nr2 orientation of
subunits was assumed around the pore.31 the sequences were
aligned on the m2 loop and the m3 segment and then submitted to
http://swissmodel.expasy.org/.

results
alanine mutagenesis scan shows two critical regions
in the  xxxg965xxx  subunit for fbm inhibition on nmda
currents. it has been shown that fbm has a stronger (∼10fold) effect on nmda receptors containing  xxxg965xxx  than those
containing  xxxg964xxx  or  xxxg966xxx  subunits.9,10 we thus made a series
of point mutations in and around atd, prem1, m2, and m3c
of the  xxxg965xxx  subunit (figure 1b). for atd, similar critical
residues for the high-affinity binding site of  xxxd2326xxx  were
selected.16 for m2, residues n615 and n616 were selected.
these residues have also been shown to form the narrowest
part of the nmda receptor pore and binding sites for pore
blockers such as mg2+ and mk-801. for prem1 and m3c, most
of the residues were selected because these two domains
presumably constitute the wall of the external pore mouth. given
that fbm binding to the nmda receptor may involve a variety
of interactions (e.g., hydrophobic and hydrogen bonds; see the
discussion), we did not restrict our mutagenesis to specific
residues chosen for their chemical properties but mutated each
residue of the studied regions into alanine (i.e., alanine mutagenesis scan). if the selected residue is alanine itself, it is

the mean relative current in 0.5 mm fbm is defined by the ratio
between the amplitude of the sustained currents elicited by 100 µm nmda
(with 10 µm glycine) in 0.5 mm fbm-containing and fbm-free external
solutions in the same oocyte and is expressed as mean ( sem. b mutations

substituted into cysteine or threonine (e.g., a644c, a648c,
a651t, and a652t). all mutants were screened by measuring
the inhibition of nmda currents by 0.5 mm fbm. the mutant
receptors that have a significantly different (p < 0.01) response
from the wild-type receptor are considered to contain mutations
at the key positions. these key mutations roughly correspond
to those mutants that showed a current decrease <16% in 0.5
mm fbm (vs 32% for the wild-type receptor; table 1). of the
41 mutations tested (all of which generated functional channels,
except f554a, w559a, n649a, and f653a), we found 11 key
positions (table 1). interestingly, these 11 key mutations are
clustered in two regions, namely atd and m3c, of the  xxxg965xxx 
subunit. the concentration–response curves of fbm were then
constructed for each of the 11 mutant and the wild-type receptors
(figure 2 and table 2). the kapp value of fbm for the wildtype receptor (containing nr1/ xxxg965xxx  subunits) is 0.87 mm,
quantitatively consistent with the previously reported values in
recombinant nr1/ xxxg965xxx  receptors (e.g., 0.52–0.93 mm).9,10 the
11 mutant receptors could be subdivided into two groups
according to the degree of reduction of apparent fbm affinity.
one group includes d101a, f176a, t233a, e236a, i641a,
and a652t mutant receptors, whose kapp values (∼2–3 mm)
are ∼2–3-fold higher than that of the wild-type receptor (table
2). the other group includes t103a, k234a, l643a, s645a,
and t647a mutant receptors, which have more pronounced
effects on fbm sensitivity with kapp values >4 mm (table 2;
the kapp values can only be roughly estimated because even
∼3 mm (a saturating concentration) fbm inhibits the nmda
current by no more than ∼40%; see figure 2b).
different mutations of t647 in m3c of the  xxxg965xxx  subunit could significantly change the inhibitory effect of
fbm on nmda currents. we have identified several key
residues (for fbm binding) clustered in two separated regions,
namely atd (e.g., t103 and k234) and m3c (e.g., l643, s645
and t647), of the  xxxg965xxx  subunit. to study the possible

figure 2. fbm concentration–response curves of the wild-type and
t647a( xxxg965xxx ) mutant receptors. (a) nmda receptors obtained from
oocytes coexpressing wild-type nr1 with either the wild-type or mutant
 xxxg965xxx  subunits were elicited by application of 100 µm nmda plus
10 µm glycine and then fbm at increasing concentrations (0.1-3 mm)
was applied to the oocytes. the bars above the current traces indicate
the application of the agonists (nmda and glycine; black bar) and
fbm (white bar). the current trace in t647a mutation (right panel) is
typical of the other receptors containing key  xxxg965xxx  mutations (e.g.,
t103a, k234a, l643a, and s645a), which have much smaller
responses to fbm than the wild-type receptor (left panel). (b) fbm
concentration–response curves were obtained with the same experimental protocol as that described in part a. the relative current is
defined by the ratio between the amplitude of the sustained currents
elicited by 100 µm nmda pulse in fbm-containing and fbmfree external solution in the same oocyte, and is expressed as mean
( sem (n ) 36 and 10 for the wild-type and t647a mutant
receptors, respectively). the relative current is plotted against the
fbm concentration, and the lines are the best fits to the mean values
of the data using eq 1.

interactions between these key residues and fbm in more detail,
we further examined the effects of other mutations of these key
residues on the apparent fbm affinity. the key residues which
have an kapp value >4 mm in alanine scanning (t103, k234,
l643, s645, and t647) were then mutated to specific amino
acids containing different side chains (e.g., charged group: r,
k, and e; aromatic group: w and f). at l643, mutations into
either a charged group (l643r, l643k, and l643e) or an
aromatic group (l643w and l643f) have a more pronounced
effect on the kapp of fbm than alanine substitution (∼10–15fold increase in the kapp value, figure 3a). at t647, sensitivity
to fbm is significantly reduced by single point mutations
t647r, t647k, and t647e (∼10–23-fold increase in the kapp
value) but is increased by single mutations t647w and t647f
(∼3–11-fold decrease in the kapp value, figure 3a). different
mutations of t647 thus could result in more than 200-fold
changes in the kapp of fbm. t647w and t647f mutations do
not alter the nmda affinity (kapp of nmda ) 15.2 ( 0.4 and
14.6 ( 0.2 µm, respectively, n ) 5–6, data not shown) but
lead to much smaller nmda currents than the wild-type
receptor (i.e., <1 µa vs ∼5 µa, n ) 5–6). we suppose that
the enhanced apparent affinity, or more precisely the enhanced
inhibitory effect, of fbm on these mutants may be ascribed to
the development or enhancement of pore-blocking effect of
fbm when fbm binds to the pore region (which is already
jeopardized by the much bulkier side chains of the mutant
residues w and f) to exert the gating-modification effect. the

the kapp and nh values of fbm are obtained from concentration-response curves using the same experimental protocol described in figure 2
and are expressed as mean ( sem (n ) 6–10 for each mutant receptor
and n ) 36 for the wild-type receptor). the kapp(mutant)/kapp(wild type)
values are the estimates of relative changes in kapp and are the ratios between
the mean kapp of the mutant and that of the wild type channels.

development of pore-blocking effect of fbm on t647w mutant
receptor is also supported by the findings that although the
mutation increases the apparent affinity of fbm, 0.3 mm fbm
no longer enhances the small current elicited by low concentrations (e.g., 6 µm) of nmda which significantly enhances the
wild-type nmda currents because of gating-modification effect
(i.e., enhancement by 1 ( 0.5% vs 35 ( 3%, p < 0.05, n ) 5,
data not shown).13 on the other hand, substitution of t647 with
cysteine (t647c) or serine (t647s) produced smaller changes
in the apparent affinity of fbm (kapp ) 2.61 and 1.09 mm,
respectively; figure 3a) than the other t647 mutant receptors
(see above). thus, at t647, the presence of a hydroxyl group
(found in t and s, which may serve as a hydrogen-bond donor)
and the relative size of the side chain (t and c) are both
important for fbm binding and its functional consequences
(see the discussion). these findings suggest that t647 and
probably also l643 are directly involved in fbm binding.
in contrast, a different profile is observed with mutations of
the other key residues t103, k234 (in atd), and s645 (in
m3c). at these positions, different mutations (e.g., t-to-r,
t-to-k, t-to-w, and t-to-f) give no significantly different
or even less effect on the kapp of fbm from alanine
substitution (figure 3b). these residues thus do not seem to
interact directly with fbm. instead, mutations at these
positions could allosterically interfere with fbm action
through the effect on local structure or gating behavior of
the nmda receptor. for example, mutations at s645 may
change the spatial orientation of l643 and t647, and then
interfere with the inhibitory effect of fbm (see below).
double mutations at l643 and t647 of the  xxxg965xxx 
subunit show additive effects on the apparent affinity

figure 3. summary of the effects of different mutations at the key
 xxxg965xxx  residues on the apparent affinity of fbm. (a and b) a number
of different mutations (e.g., mutated into r, k, e, w, and f) were
studied at residues l643, t647 (part a), t103, k234, and s645 (part
b) in the  xxxg965xxx  subunit. the same experimental protocol and analysis
were done as in figure 2 (n ) 6–10 for each mutant receptor). the
kapp values for each mutant receptor are obtained from the fits to the
fbm concentration–response curves using eq 1 (nh ) 0.99–1.06) and
are expressed relative to that of the wild-type receptor. the dotted line

of fbm. l643 and t647 presumably are adjacent residues on
roughly the same face of an r-helix, the presumable secondary
structure of m3c. to examine the possibility of direct contribution of l643 and t647 to the fbm binding site, we studied the
effects of double mutations on the kapp of fbm (figure 4).
l643a+t647a double mutation indeed has a much greater
effect than either single mutation (kapp increased by ∼40-, ∼6-,
and ∼7-fold for l643a+t647a, l643a, and t647a mutations,
respectively; figure 4a and table 2). to further evaluate that
two residues in double mutations interact independently or
cooperatively for fbm binding, we used double mutant cycle
analysis to calculate a coupling coefficient (omega) and coupling
energy (∆∆gint) for each pair of mutations.32 if the two residues
are coupled in energy terms, there will be a coupling energy
∆∆gint given by

state data.12,13 also, the hill coefficients (i.e., nh values) in table
2 are very close to ∼1 for both the wild-type and most mutant
receptors. these findings indicate that although the highest fbm
concentration used in this study (∼3 mm, which is roughly its
maximal solubility in water) may not inhibit a large proportion
of nmda currents in some mutants, the kapp value fitted from
the concentration–response curve should be the best (and also
a reasonable) measure we can have for the affinity of fbm to
the receptor. we thus took the kapp value of fbm as a first
approximation of the kd value in eqs 2 and 3. the reduction in
the apparent fbm affinity of the double mutation l643a+t647a
is consistent with an additive (noncooperative) effect (coupling
coefficient ) 0.83, figure 4e). we further examined the effects
of other double mutations at l643 and t647 on fbm sensitivity
and found that effect of l643c+t647a double mutation is also
additive (kapp increased by ∼21-, ∼3-, and ∼7-fold for
l643c+t647a, l643c, and t647a mutations, respectively;
figure 4b and a coupling coefficient of 0.96; figure 4e). the
additive feature strongly suggests that residues l643 and t647
independently contribute to the fbm binding site. if each of
the single mutations decreases the apparent affinity of fbm
because of an indirect effect on channel gating, then double
mutations of both residues would not be independent but share
a common pathway to affect fbm binding. in other words, even

chang and kuo

if the mutations separately contribute to redistribute the receptor
to the states where fbm binding is more (or less) favorable,
from then on the effects would coalesce to affect fbm binding
via the same process of gating conformational changes, and
consequently, the effects of double mutations would not be
additive. fbm thus very likely interacts directly rather than
allosterically (via the channel gating process) with residues l643
and t647. on the other hand, additive effects cannot be observed
with the double mutations other than l643+t647. the double
mutations combining l643a and any one of t103a, k234a,
or s645a (these latter three single mutations also have
significant effects on the kapp of fbm) show no additive effects
on the kapp of fbm (figure 4c and table 2). the same findings
are also obtained with the double mutations combining t647a
and any one of t103a, k234a, or s645a (figure 4d and table
2). moreover, the effects of double mutations s645a+t103a,
s645a+k234a, s645a+i641a, and t103a+k234a on fbm
sensitivity are not significantly greater than those of individual
single mutations (table 2). the coupling coefficients thus
are significantly smaller than 1 (i.e., ∼0.2–0.3) in these double
mutations (figure 4e). these findings would support the
foregoing idea that these residues (e.g., t103 and k234 in atd,
and s645 in m3c) allosterically rather than directly contribute
to fbm binding.
residue t647 (but not l643) of the  xxxg965xxx  subunit plays
a pivotal role coupling fbm binding and channel
gating. we have shown that fbm is an effective gating
modifier of the nmda channel and has a ∼2- to 4-fold higher
affinity to the open and especially the desensitized channels than
to the closed channels.13 it would be interesting to see whether
mutations of the foregoing residues that are directly or allosterically involved in fbm binding may also affect nmda
channel gating (e.g., alteration of the nmda affinity to the
nmda receptor). figure 5a shows nmda concentration–response curves of the wild-type and selected  xxxg965xxx  mutant
receptors. none of the mutants of the key residues significantly
decrease the nmda affinity to the receptor, and most of the
mutant receptors (e.g., l643a, t103a, and k234a) have kapp
values (∼12–16 µm) of nmda similar to that of the wildtype receptor (kapp ) 14.4 µm). the reduced fbm sensitivity
in these mutants (especially l643a and t647a) thus cannot
be ascribed to any decrease in the nmda affinity to the
receptor, consistent with the foregoing idea that l643 and t647
directly rather than allosterically contribute to the fbm binding
site. in contrast, it is interesting that t647a (kapp ) 4.5 µm)
and s645a (kapp ) 7.6 µm) mutant receptors significantly
enhance (∼2–3-fold) the apparent affinity of nmda to the
receptor (i.e., shift concentration–response curves to the left),
suggesting that t647 and s645 are also closely involved in the
nmda-dependent gating process of the receptor. because
t647a mutation enhances apparent nmda affinity to the
receptor, it would tend to redistribute the receptor to the states
where nmda binding is more preferable. because fbm has a
higher affinity toward the gating conformations induced by
nmda binding (i.e., the open and desensitized states of the
channel), the effect of t647a on channel gating then should
increase rather than decrease the apparent affinity of fbm. the
experimental findings of “decreased” apparent affinity of fbm
in t647a mutation (figure 2 and table 2) thus cannot be
ascribed to an indirect (or allosteric) effect derived from channel
gating. moreover, the double (e.g., l643a+t647a( xxxg965xxx ))
mutations which produced much more pronounced effects on
the apparent fbm affinity (figure 4a) did not cause more
changes in nmda affinity than that in single mutant t647a

this finding also strongly argues against that t647 and l643
necessarily affect fbm binding because of their primary effect
on channel gating. along with the foregoing findings that t647

may directly contribute to the fbm binding site (figures 3 and
4), it is very likely that t647 plays a pivotal role coupling fbm
binding and channel gating (see the discussion). on the other
hand, s645 probably acts as a transducer relaying the gating
effect of nmda binding to the fbm binding site, and s645
mutations may well affect the local conformations of the
adjacent t647 and l643. s645a mutation thus also mildly shifts
the nmda concentration–response curve (figure 5a), but no
additive effect is observed in l643a+s645a or t647a+s645a
double mutations (figure 4e).
two residues v644 and t648 in m3c of the nr1
subunit also contribute to the fbm binding site. nmda
receptors are heterotetrameric channels composed of the nr1
and nr2 subunits, both contributing to the constitution of the
pore region.19,23,33 to determine whether the nr1 subunit also
contributes to the fbm binding site, we further examined the
kapp of fbm in nr1 mutant receptors (i.e., mutations of v644
and t648 in nr1, residues homologous to l643 and t647 in
 xxxg965xxx , respectively). very much analogous to t647 mutations
in  xxxg965xxx , t648 mutations in nr1 also significantly decrease
or increase the inhibitory effect of fbm on nmda currents
(figure 6a). the effect of fbm is reduced by single-point
mutations t648a and t648e (nr1) (∼6.5- and ∼16-fold
increase in the kapp value, respectively), but is increased by
single mutations t648w and t648f (nr1) (∼4- and ∼5-fold
decrease in the kapp value, respectively). these results strongly
suggest that residue t648(nr1) also contributes to fbm binding
in a very similar way to that of t647( xxxg965xxx ). moreover, the

t647( xxxg965xxx ) contribute similarly (or even equally) and act
cooperatively to make the “outer binding region” in the fbm
binding site, whereas v644(nr1) and l643( xxxg965xxx ) contribute
similarly and act cooperatively to make the “inner binding
region” in the same binding site. the outer and inner binding
regions, on the other hand, seem to contribute independently
(noncooperatively) to fbm binding. most interestingly, combination of any three point mutations of the four critical residues

nr1 mutant receptor v644a has a ∼6-fold increase in the kapp
of fbm (figure 6c), quantitatively similar to that of  xxxg965xxx 
mutant receptor l643a. on the other hand, we also found in
the nr1 mutations that t648a but not v644a enhances the
glycine affinity to the receptor (kapp of glycine ) 0.52, 0.14,
and 0.56 µm for the wild-type, t648a, and v644a mutant
receptors, respectively, n ) 6–8; figure 6d), a case very similar
to the enhanced nmda affinity in the corresponding  xxxg965xxx 
mutant receptors.
the four pairs of homologous residues in two nr1nr2b heterodimers exclusively make the fbm binding
site. we have demonstrated that four residues in m3c of the
 xxxg965xxx  (l643 and t647) and nr1 (v644 and t648) subunits
are critically involved in fbm binding to the nmda receptor.
to determine individual contribution of the four critical residues
to the fbm binding site, we further examined the effects of
double mutations of these residues on the kapp of fbm. figure
7 shows that double mutations of any two nonhomologous
critical residues in nr1 and  xxxg965xxx  (e.g., v644a+t648a
(nr1),v644a(nr1)+t647a( xxxg965xxx ),l643a( xxxg965xxx )+t648a(nr1),
and also l643a+t647a( xxxg965xxx ) in figure 4e) lead to additive
(noncooperative) effects on the apparent affinity of fbm
(coupling coefficients ) 0.84–0.92; figures 4e and 7d). however,
in double mutations of two homologous residues such as
v644a(nr1)+l643a( xxxg965xxx ) and t648a(nr1)+t647a( xxxg965xxx ),
the additivity is much weaker (coupling coefficients ) 0.28 and
0.16, respectively; figure 7d). the significant negative coupling
energy (∆∆g int ) -0.8 and -1.1 kcal/mol, respectively,
calculated by eq 2) further indicates that there is an attractive
interaction between these two homologous residues in nr1 and
 xxxg965xxx . these findings strongly suggest that t648(nr1) and

abolishes the inhibitory effect of 3 mm fbm (a saturating
concentration of fbm) on nmda currents (figure 8), but does
not cause more changes in nmda affinity than t647a single
mutation (figure 5b). these findings altogether indicate that
the four pairs of homologous residues, namely v644(nr1)l643( xxxg965xxx ) and t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx ), in two nr1- xxxg965xxx 
heterodimers directly and exclusively make the fbm binding
site (see the discussion).
discussion
residues v644(nr1)-l643( xxxg965xxx ) and t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx ) directly contribute to the fbm binding site. we
have shown that l643 and t647 in m3c of  xxxg965xxx  and their
homologous residues (v644 and t648) in nr1 are critically
involved in fbm binding to the nmda receptor. different
mutations of t647( xxxg965xxx ) and t648(nr1) significantly decrease
or increase the inhibitory effect of fbm on nmda currents
and could result in more than 200-fold changes in the kapp of
fbm (figures 3a and 6a). mutations of l643( xxxg965xxx ) and
v644(nr1) also significantly increase the kapp of fbm by
∼6–15 times (figures 3a and 6c). in this regard, it is interesting
that t647a mutation also enhances the nmda affinity to the
receptor (figure 5a). the effect of t647a on channel gating
thus, if anything, should increase the apparent affinity of fbm
rather than decrease it because fbm has a higher affinity to
the open/desensitized than the closed channels.13 also, l643a
mutation has no effect on channel gating or nmda affinity
(figure 5a) but still significantly decreases the apparent affinity
of fbm (figure 3a and table 2). residues l643 and t647
thus very likely serve as a direct contributor to the fbm binding
site rather than affect fbm affinity indirectly via a primary effect
on channel gating. moreover, double mutations in the same
subunit, such as l643a+t647a( xxxg965xxx ), l643c+t647a( xxxg965xxx ),
or v644a+t648a(nr1) lead to additive (noncooperative)
effects on the apparent affinity of fbm (coupling coefficient )
∼1; figures 4a,b,e and 7a). the additivity strongly suggests
that the two residues in the same subunit (l643-t647 in  xxxg965xxx 
or v644-t648 in nr1) independently contribute to fbm
binding. it is thus unlikely that the mutations of these residues
are coupled to the channel gating process to affect fbm binding.
consistently, double mutations (e.g.,  xxxg965xxx (l643a+t647a))
produce much more pronounced effects on the apparent affinity
of fbm (figure 4a), and triple mutations (e.g., nr1(v644a)+
 xxxg965xxx (l643a+t647a)) essentially abolish the fbm effect on
the receptor (figure 8), but they do not cause more changes in
nmda affinity than that in single mutation t647a (figure 5b).
also, it is unusual to completely wipe out the effect of a gating
modifier by mutations of the ligands which are just allosterically
related to the drug binding site (especially when channel gating
itself is only so trivially affected by the mutations). we therefore
conclude that the fbm binding site is directly and exclusively
constituted by the four pairs of homologous residues, namely
v644(nr1)-l643( xxxg965xxx ) (the two inner pairs) and t648(nr1)-

t647( xxxg965xxx ) (the two outer pairs), in two nr1- xxxg965xxx  heterodimers (see below).
the fbm binding site is located at the external pore
mouth of the nmda receptor. the internal vestibule of the
nmda channel is probably formed by m2 loops from two nr1
and two nr2 subunits,33 whereas the external vestibule is
formed by residues on prem1, m3c, and the n-terminal part of
m4 (m4n).19,20 for more detailed topology of the external

journal of medicinal chemistry, 2008, vol. 51, no. 6 1541

vestibule, m3c probably is responsible for the deeper part
leading to the narrow constriction (presumable “selectivity
filter”) in the pore, whereas prem1 and m4n may form more
superficial parts.20 residues l643, t647 ( xxxg965xxx ), v644, and
t648 (nr1), which exclusively make the fbm binding site,
are located in the middle part of m3 in sequence (figure 9a)
and are thus very likely located in the external vestibule of the
channel pore. although no atomic structural resolution of the
nmda receptor is available at present, there is a general
consensus that the pore region of the nmda receptor shares
evolutionary and structural kinship with k+ channels and their
relatives.33–37 we therefore constructed a homology model of
the pore region of nmda receptors for the open state (figure
9c), which was derived from the crystal structure of the mthk
k+ channel.30 it is interesting that similar to the inner helix of
an inverted k+ channel, m3 of nmda receptors may well
represent a major pore-lining domain. in addition, m3 is
r-helical, with the tip of m2 loop (defined by the q/r/n site
which is n616 in nr1 or n615 in  xxxg965xxx ) positioned about
halfway across it.19 the two residues of the same subunit
critically involved in fbm binding (i.e., l643 and t647 of
 xxxg965xxx , or v644 and t648 of nr1) thus face the same side
(figure 9b), consistent with the finding that both residues in
the same subunit are also solvent accessible to methanethiosulfonate (mts) reagents.19,20 in other words, they very likely
line the lumen of the channel pore. in contrast, residue
s645( xxxg965xxx ) is close to l643 and t647 but does not face the
same side as l643 and t647, consistent with its solvent
inaccessibility to mts reagents. moreover, residues n615, l643,
and t647 in  xxxg965xxx  as well as homologous residues in nr1
(i.e., n616, v644, and t648) probably form the bottom part of
the external vestibule (figure 9c). in this regard, it is interesting
to note that the pore-blocking effect of fbm on the nmda
channel is not evident at ph 7.4 but becomes manifest at ph
8.4,18 reminiscent of the na+-dependent “opportunistic” pore
blocking effect of diclofenac on the na+ channel pore.38
moreover, the inhibitory effect of fbm on nmda currents is
antagonized by external but not internal na+.18 fbm thus also
is an “opportunistic” pore blocker of the nmda channel, very
likely with its binding site located at the junction of a relatively
widened and a narrow part of the external vestibule of the
channel pore. this picture is consistent with the presumable
structural features of l643-t647 depicted by figure 9c.
the fbm binding site is composed of two binding
regions made by symmetrically arranged m3c domains
of the nr1 and  xxxg965xxx  subunits. there is always significant
cooperative effect on fbm binding in double mutations of
the homologous critical residues (i.e., residues from the same
pairs). for example, the coupling coefficients are 0.28 and
0.16fort648a(nr1)+t647a( xxxg965xxx )andv644a(nr1)+l643a( xxxg965xxx ),
respectively (figure 7d). the cooperative feature strongly
suggests that homologous residues t648(nr1) and t647( xxxg965xxx )
(in the outer pairs) interact with each other to make the “outer
binding region”, whereas v644(nr1) and l643( xxxg965xxx ) (in
the inner pairs) also interact with each other to form the
“inner binding region” of the fbm binding site. the
cooperative interactions between these homologous residues
would furthermore indicate that t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx ) or
v644(nr1)-l643( xxxg965xxx ) in the same nr1- xxxg965xxx  heterodimer are located in close proximity to each other in
spatial orientation (figure 10 and see below). this finding
is also well in line with the idea that the nr1-nr2
heterodimer is the functional unit in tetrameric nmda
receptors.39 on the other hand, the additive effect on fbm

channels. (b) helical wheel plot for 18 residues (i641-e658) within m3 of the  xxxg965xxx  subunit. the number denotes the position of a residue in the
 xxxg965xxx  subunit. two critical residues for fbm binding, namely l643 and t647, are shown as red symbols with white labels. (c) a homology model
for the pore region of nmda receptors is based on the crystal structure of the mthk (open conformation)  xxxg1232xxx . the m1, m2, and
m3 segments from two opposite nr1- xxxg965xxx  subunits are shown as cartoons, with the front and back subunits removed for clarity. the asparagine
residue at the q/r/n site of  xxxg965xxx  (i.e., n615 which is located at the tip of m2 loop) as well as l643 and t647 (and homologous residues of nr1,
i.e., n616, v644, and t648) are shown as spacefills and are colored green, red, and blue, respectively. these residues probably form the deeper part
of the external vestibule of the nmda channel pore.

binding in double mutations of any two critical residues from
different pairs (with coupling coefficients of ∼1; figure 7d)
indicates that the inner (i.e., v644(nr1)-l643( xxxg965xxx )) and
outer (i.e., t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx )) binding regions of the
binding site contribute independently to fbm binding, despite
their close proximity to each other (vertical distance ∼6 å
in an r-helix). the fbm binding site thus seems to have a
fairly symmetrical build-up along the axis of the nmda
channel pore at least in m3c (but see ref 40). based on our
experimental data and homology modeling of the pore region,
we propose a stereographic model describing the fbm
binding site consisting of two independent (outer and inner)
binding regions with two pairs of symmetrically arranged
and mutually interacting binding residues in each region
(figure 10). the two homologous hydrophilic threonine

residues (i.e., t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx )) in each nr1- xxxg965xxx 
heterodimer probably interact with each other to put two
hydroxyl groups in a favorable spatial orientation and
therefore interact with the two opposite carbamate groups
of one fbm molecule with hydrogen bonds. on the other
hand, the two homologous hydrophobic residues (i.e.,
v644(nr1)-l643( xxxg965xxx )) in each nr1- xxxg965xxx  heterodimer
may interact to form the hydrophobic binding site for the
phenyl group of fbm.
residue t647( xxxg965xxx ) plays a pivotal role in fbm binding,
ion permeation, nmda-dependent channel gating, and
extracellular ph-sensitive conformational changes. in all
glutamate receptors, the m3c domain contains a highly
conserved nine amino acid sequence (the “sytanlaaf”
motif). substitutions of residues in this motif of the nmda

figure 10. stereographic model of the fbm binding site. the fbm binding site in the nmda receptor is composed of two independent (inner
and outer) binding regions with four relatively symmetrically arranged and cooperatively interacting residues in each region. fbm has a phenyl
group and a symmetrical propanediol dicarbamate group (figure 1c). two critical residues (for fbm binding) in the same subunit, namely v644
and t648 in nr1 or l643 and t647 in  xxxg965xxx , should be ∼6 å apart on roughly the same face of a presumable r-helix of m3c (figure 9b). the
outer binding region of the fbm binding site thus is formed by the four homologous residues of two t648 in nr1 and two t647 in  xxxg965xxx  (the
t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx ) plane, colored brown), and the inner binding region is formed by the four homologous residues of two v644 in nr1 and
two l643 in  xxxg965xxx  (the v644(nr1)-l643( xxxg965xxx ) plane, colored pink). these are depicted with an nr1-nr1-nr2-nr2 orientation of subunits
around the pore.31 the outer t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx ) plane is rotated by 40° relative the inner v644(nr1)-l643( xxxg965xxx ) plane because of the
r-helical structure of m3c (see also the inset figure, showing the positions of the binding ligands on the m3c columns viewed from the exterolateral
side). for clarity, only side chains of these critical residues are shown. red and blue dotted lines indicate the hydrogen-bond and the hydrophobic
interactions, respectively. threonine, which has a hydroxyl group, on either position 648(nr1) or 647( xxxg965xxx ) may serve as a hydrogen-bond
donor. two homologous residues t648(nr1) and t647( xxxg965xxx ) in the nr1- xxxg965xxx  heterodimer interact with each other (probably with a hydrogen
bond) to form each of the two parts of the outer binding region, which most likely binds to the oxygen or nitrogen atoms of the two carbamate
groups of fbm (i.e., presumably also with a hydrogen bond). on the other hand, the hydrophobic side chains of v644(nr1) and l643( xxxg965xxx ) in
the nr1- xxxg965xxx  heterodimer also interact with each other to establish two identical hydrophobic inner binding regions (presumable a six-carbon
structure), and the phenyl group of fbm presumably would bind to one of the two regions. we have demonstrated that fbm binds to the nmda
receptor via a one-to-one binding process (one fbm per nmda receptor). the 3d structure of fbm is constructed by the dundee prodrg
server (http://davapc1.bioch.dundee.ac.uk/programs/prodrg/), and is shown as sticks with green carbon, red oxygen, blue nitrogen, and gray hydrogen.
the linear distance between the center of the phenyl group and the oxygen or nitrogen atom of the carbamate group is ∼6.5 å, and thus, the vertical
height of fbm is well consistent with the distance between t647 and l643 in  xxxg965xxx  (or between t648 and v644 in nr1). the horizontal distance
of the two oxygen or nitrogen atoms on the opposite carbamate groups is ∼7 å. if the t648(nr1)-t647( xxxg965xxx ) plane has a roughly rectangular
shape, the diagonal distance of the outer binding region is estimated to be ∼20 å with the usual bond lengths (between o-h · · · o, c-c, and so
on) taken into consideration. the width and length of the plane at the outer binding region are thus estimated to be ∼11 and ∼17 å, respectively.
each of the two carbamate groups of fbm would then well fit to bind to each “side” of the outer region with a hydrogen bond, respectively. when
the phenyl group of fbm is bound to one of the two inner binding regions, the remaining space (pink area) of the pore at the v644(nr1)l643( xxxg965xxx ) plane should be at least ∼7 å in width for the passage of traveling hydrated ions (e.g., na+, because fbm is chiefly a gating modifier
rather a pore blocker at physiological ph). taking the c-c or c-o bond length (∼1.5 å) into consideration, we estimate the width and length
of the “plane” at the inner binding regions as ∼10 and ∼16 å, respectively.

receptor have been shown to significantly alter channel
gating,20–24 indicating that m3c plays an essential role in
nmda channel gating. in this study, we found that two
 xxxg965xxx  single mutations (s645a and t647a) at this conserved
motif show an enhancement effect on nmda affinity to the
receptor (figure 5a). interestingly, this mild but definite
(∼2–3-fold) enhancement of nmda affinity in t647a( xxxg965xxx )
mutation is quantitatively consistent with the previous report

that fbm has a ∼2–4-fold higher affinity to the open/
desensitized than to the closed channels.13 on the other hand,
mutation of the other critical residue for fbm binding (i.e.,
l643 in  xxxg965xxx ), which is not in the conserved sytanlaaf
motif, does not alter nmda affinity to the receptor. recently,
we have shown that fbm may act as an “opportunistic” pore
blocker of the nmda channel modulated by extracellular
proton.18 the fbm binding site (the binding ligands for

1544 journal of medicinal chemistry, 2008, vol. 51, no. 6

fbm) in the nmda channel thus should be located in the
pore region closely related to ph-sensitive gating conformational changes. consistently, low et al. reported that
clustered residues in both the m3c domain (e.g., t648 in
nr1 and t646 in  xxxg964xxx , which correspond to t647 in  xxxg965xxx )
and the adjacent linker to the ligand-binding domain s2 (m3s2 linker) of nr1 and nr2 are closely related to the protonsensitive channel gating.41 residue t647( xxxg965xxx ) and very
likely also t648(nr1) thus may not only contribute directly
to the fbm binding site, but also play a pivotal role
orchestrating fbm binding, ion permeation, nmda-dependent channel gating, and extracellular ph-sensitive conformational changes at the external vestibule of the channel pore.
pharmaceutical implications. nmda receptor antagonists
have been shown to have a broad-spectrum antiepileptic effect
on experimental seizure models and thus have generated
considerable interest. unfortunately, in clinical trials, most
nmda receptor antagonists were found to have serious neurobehavioral complications which limited their further pharmaceutical development. fbm is so far the only approved
anticonvulsant that evidently modulates nmda receptor activity
in therapeutic conditions. in this study, we characterize the
fbm-nmda receptor interactions in detail and forward a
stereographic model depicting the key features of fbm binding.
the proposed binding model not only explains the action of
fbm but also suggests the functional moieties in the fbm
molecule essential for its antiepileptic effect. although fbm is
a potent, nonsedative anticonvulsant, it has been limited to a
second-line choice in most clinical conditions because of the
risk of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity and hematotoxicity.1–3
hopefully, the proposed molecular model of fbm action may
serve as a rational basis for possible structural modifications of
fbm, so that new anticonvulsants with less adverse reactions
but unaffected (or even enhanced) therapeutic effect could be
more efficiently developed.
