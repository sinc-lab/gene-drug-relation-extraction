dc-3f/ xxxg760xxx  cells ( xxxg760xxx ) were derived from antifolatesensitive chl cells by selection for growth in folatefree media containing 15 pm [6s]-5chofh4. these
cells undergo a 30-fold decrease in intracellular
folates, overexpress  xxxg807xxx  alpha (fr ) and
metallothionein ii, and display increased sensitivity to
the  xxxg631xxx  (dhfr) targeted antifolates methotrexate (mtx) and  xxxd3442xxx  (tmtx),
which can be attributed primarily to the folate pool
status. upon folate repletion by growth in 15 nm [6s]5chofh4, they display a 5- and 10-fold increase in
resistance to both drugs, respectively, even though
folate pools are restored by only 43%. enforced
overexpression of fr in transfectants cultured in
nanomolar folate did not confer resistance to mtx but
did support a modest 2-fold increase in resistance to
tmtx. enforced overexpression of mtii had a similar
effect, but when both were overexpressed together
no increase in resistance beyond that conferred by
each one separately was noted, suggesting that both
confer resistance to tmtx through a common
downstream mechanism. analysis of three independent low folate selected clones,  xxxg760xxx , fa7, and fa14,
showed that each had a 5- to 6-fold increase in dhfr
activity accompanied by a similar increase in dhfr

in the dhfr gene copy number or in the steady-state
amount of dhfr mrna, suggesting that a posttranscriptional mechanism was responsible for the
increase in dhfr expression.

introduction
mammalian cells cannot carry out the de
novo synthesis of  xxxd2146xxx , and while the
folate cycle (1,2) is responsible for maintaining intracellular folate homeostasis, cells
must rely upon uptake of serum folate to
maintain pool equilibrium and ensure survival. the primary serum folate is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-ch3fh4), and once
internalized it serves as a cofactor for the
enzyme  xxxg1479xxx . as a result, it
is converted to tetrahydrofolate ( xxxd3334xxx ) and it
is from this reaction that new folate
moieties enter the cycle. this can also be
accomplished through the uptake 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-chofh4), also known as
 xxxd2147xxx , or  xxxd2462xxx . this form of
reduced folate is metabolized to  xxxd3334xxx  (3)
bypassing the need for the reduction of

folate depletion and antifolate resistance

dihydrofolate (fh2) to  xxxd3334xxx  by dihydrofolate
reductase (dhfr), and thus providing the
basis for so-called `` xxxd2462xxx  rescue,''
through which patients may be protected
from the toxic effects of high dose methotrexate (mtx) therapy (4,5). given these
metabolic pathways, it might be expected
that as a direct consequence of restricting
serum folate, intracellular levels of  xxxd3334xxx 
would decrease and that, to a first approximation, the biochemical consequences to
the cell might be reminiscent of those caused
by exposure to antifolates that target dhfr,
i.e., mtx and  xxxd3442xxx  (tmtx), and
prevent the regeneration of  xxxd3334xxx  from fh2.
to an extent, this has been found to be the
case (6±8), although the effects of these two
antifolates, and in particular the accumulation of fh2 polyglutamates that occurs when
dhfr is inhibited, have large impact on
folate metabolism (9,10).
from the standpoint of selection, genetic
alterations that provide survival after depletion of  xxxd3334xxx  via the use of antifolates as
compared with those that occur as a consequence of restricting folate in the media
are likely to be very different. mutations
emerging during selection for survival in
mtx or tmtx would be ones that lower the
effectiveness of the drug, by preventing its
uptake, or increasing its efflux, or by altering
the target enzyme in either a quantitative or
qualitative manner. in fact, all of these have
been observed (2,11). it is less clear, however, what genetic changes or metabolic/
biochemical alterations, beyond those that
deal with the well-documented changes in
folate transport (12±14), might emerge during
selection for growth under conditions of folate
depletion and how they might affect cell
growth and drug resistance. it is also unclear
what differences, if any, may be inherent by
using 5-chofh4 as opposed to 5-ch3fh4 as
the source of reduced folate for such studies.
to address some of these issues we have
undertaken a series of experiments to analyze changes in gene expression and cellular
metabolism that emerge in cells selected for
growth under conditions of severe folate
restriction, i.e., in subnanomolar levels of
reduced folate, comparable perhaps to those
found in early-stage tumors prior to vascularization or at the hypoxic center of more
mature solid tumors. we have chosen to use

the natural isomer of  xxxd2147xxx , [6s]5chofh4, as the folate source for these
initial studies, and have isolated three independent clones from the highly tumorigenic
chinese hamster cell line dc-3f: dc-3f/
 xxxg760xxx  ( xxxg760xxx ), dc-3f/fa7 (fa7), and dc-3f/
fa14 (fa14). each of these clones has been
found to overexpress  xxxg807xxx  alpha
(fr ) (15) and metallothionein ii (16) and, as
reported here, to be resistant to mtx and
tmtx when grown in 15 nm [6s]-5chofh4.
since both fr and mt have been shown to be
associated with the modulation of anticancer
drug resistance, albeit to different types of
compounds (17±20), we sought to determine
the extent to which their overexpression in
folate-depleted cells affects antifolate sensitivity and also investigated their role in
mediating drug sensitivity during folate repletion. the results, in agreement with previously published reports (21±23), show that
in 15 nm [6s]-5chofh4, overexpression of
fr in transfectants does not confer resistance to mtx, but does modestly elevate
resistance to tmtx by two-fold, accounting
for approximately 20% of the resistance
displayed by  xxxg760xxx  cells in this media. similarly
overexpression of mtii does not confer resistance to mtx, but it too elevates resistance to
tmtx by two-fold. when expressed together
in cotransfectants, however, no additivity or
synergism is observed, suggesting that overexpression of these gene products affect
resistance to tmtx through the same or
similar mechanisms. unexpectedly, the bulk
of the antifolate resistance in these clones is
associated with a five-fold increase in dhfr
activity mediated by what appears to be a
posttranslational mechanism.

(brea, ca). polyglutamylated forms of mtx
were purchased from schircks laboratories,
jona, switzerland, and tissue culture
reagents were purchased from invitrogen,
carlsbad, ca. o- and n-glycosidases were
obtained from boehringer mannheim
(indianapolis, in). reagents for electrophoresis were obtained from biorad (hercules, ca)
or from sigma chemical (st. louis, mo). all
other chemicals were obtained from sigma.
cell culture and selection
parental chinese hamster lung fibroblast
cells (dc-3f) were maintained in minimal
essential medium (mem) with ham's f12
nutrient mixture (dmem/f12), supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum (fbs; hyclone, logan, ut), and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin. clones selected for
growth under conditions of severe folate
restriction were maintained in mem/f12
without hypoxanthine, thymidine, or folic
acid, and were supplemented with 5% dialyzed, heat-inactivated fbs, and 15 pm
[6s]- xxxd2147xxx  (fa medium), as described
previously (15). fa medium containing 15 nm
instead of 15 pm [6s]-5chofh4 is referred to
as 15 nm fa medium.
growth curves were obtained from subconfluent cells that were harvested by treating with 0.05% trypsin and 0.2% edta. after
washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), the cells were seeded in a series of
25-cm2 flasks at 1  105 in dmem/f12, or at
2  105 in fa medium. in both cases, the
media was replaced every 3 days. cells were
harvested at 24-h intervals by rinsing twice
with 5 ml pbs (ph 7.5) before being detached
from the surface by a brief exposure to 0.05%
trypsin. single-cell suspensions were made
by repeated pipetting, and cell numbers
determined by counting under the microscope after staining with 0.4% trypan blue.
each of the time points reported represents
the average value obtained from triplicate
cultures.
cytotoxicity assays
the ed50, defined, as the drug dose required
to reduce cell growth after 72 h to 50% of
controls, was used as the measure of drug
resistance. briefly, 1  104 cells were plated
onto each well of a 96-well plate and incubated overnight. drug was then added to each
266

well and the cells incubated at 378c for 72 h,
at which time they were washed with pbs and
100 l of 10 m p-nitrophenyphosphate (pnp)
added. after 2 h of incubation at 378c, the
samples were read at 405 and 620 nm in a
dual-wavelength microplate reader. alternatively, cells were removed from the wells by
mild trypsin digestion and counted as
described above for the growth curve studies.
estimation of folate pool size
and composition
the ternary complex assay described previously (24) was used to measure the reduced
folate pools. the assay is based upon enzymatic cycling of reduced folates to methylenetetrahydrofolate (ch2fh4) followed by
entrapment into a stable ternary complex
with excess  xxxg2366xxx  (ts) and
[3h]5-fluoro-20-deoxyridine-monophosphate
([3h]fdump) (25). briefly, cells were washed
twice with ice-cold pbs and cell pellets were
frozen immediately and stored at 808c until
analyzed. frozen pellets containing 2  107
cells were suspended in 300±800 l of cold
extraction buffer containing 50 mm tris-hcl
and 50 mm sodium ascorbate (ph 7.4), lysed
by boiling for 3 min and centrifuged at
15,000  g for 5 min at 48c. aliquots (10±
40 l) of the supernatant were used to
determine intracellular folates. reaction mixtures for analysis of ch2fh4 contained
20 mu of l. casei ts and 125 nm [3h]fdump
(20 ci/mmol) in a total volume of 100 l of
the above extraction buffer. additional
enzymes and cofactors were added as necessary to convert each of the reduced folates,
fh2,  xxxd3334xxx , 5-ch3fh4, 10-formyltetrahydrofolate (10-chofh4), and 5-chofh4 to the
ch2fh4 form (26,27). reactions were
stopped by boiling for 10 min in 1% sds.
aliquots (25-l) were applied to sephadex
g-25 minicolumns and eluted by centrifugation to separate radiolabeled complexes from
free [3h]fdump. radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting and used to
estimate reduced folate content. protein concentrations were determined by the method
of bradford (28).
northern blot analysis
twenty micrograms of total rna, isolated
with trizol ls reagent (invitrogen), was
fractionated on a 1% agarose gel and blotted

folate depletion and antifolate resistance

onto genescreen plus nylon membranes.
these were prehybridized for 4 h at 428c in
5  sspe, 5  denhardt's solution, 1% sds,
50% formamide, 10%  xxxd1860xxx , and
100 g/ml denatured and fragmented salmon sperm dna. chinese hamster cdnas for
fr (15) or for metallothionein ii (16) were
labeled to a specific activity of >109 cpm/g
with [ -32p]dctp using the random primers
labeling system from invitrogen. the resulting probe was denatured by boiling, and
applied to the membranes in prehybridization buffer. hybridization was allowed to
proceed for 24 h at 428c. after washing,
autoradiography was carried out using
reflection2 film with double intensifying
screens. the membranes were stripped for
rehybridization with a labeled -actin control
cdna probe by boiling in a solution of 10 mm
tris-hcl, ph 7.5, 1 mm edta, 1% sds for
15 min, washing in the same buffer, and
hybridizing as described above for the fr
probe. relative expression levels were estimated using an alpha innotech image
analyzer.
western blot analysis
monolayer cultures were drained of media
and rinsed with cold pbs and then lysed
directly using 2  electrophoresis sample
buffer containing, 125 mm tris ph 6.8, 4%
sds, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromophenol
blue, 2% b- xxxd26xxx , and 2 mm
pmsf. debris was removed by low-speed
centrifugation and 40 g of supernatant
added to each well of a 12% sdspolyacrylamide gel. following electrophoresis
for 4 h at 50 ma, fractionated peptides were
electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose paper and probed with a dhfr-specific
monoclonal antibody obtained from bd biosciences, san diego, ca. the amount of dhfr
present was determined using the ecl
system from amersham-pharmacia biotech,
piscataway, nj.
dna transfection
a full-length hamster fr cdna insert was
removed from plasmid pfa3-p2k (7) by noti
digestion and subcloned into the eukaryotic
expression vector pcdna3.1/zeo (+) (invitrogen), which uses zeocin as a dominant
selectable marker. orientation of the insert
in the resulting plasmid, pcdna3.1/zeo-fr ,

was confirmed by dna sequencing. transfection was carried out with the use of lipofectin reagent (invitrogen). transformants were
selected in 400 g/ml zeocin2 for 7±10 days.
individual clones were isolated and analyzed
for the expression of fr by northern blot.
clone dcfr3 was found to overexpress fr
mrna to approximately twice that found in
 xxxg760xxx  cells and was used for further study.
an mtii expression construct (pcdna3.1/
neo-mt) reported previously (16) was obtained from a pcr-amplified full-length hamster mtii cdna and by cloning into the
mammalian expression vector pcdna3.1 (+)/
neo (invitrogen). transfection was carried out
as described above with lipofectin, and
transformants selected in 400 g/ml  xxxg418xxx 
(sigma) for 10±15 days. individual clones were
isolated and analyzed for mt expression by
northern blot. one clone, dcmt4, was found
to express mtii at levels similar to  xxxg760xxx  cells.
a cotransfectant, dcfr3(mt), overexpressing both fr and mtii to levels similar to
 xxxg760xxx  cells was developed by transforming
dcfr3 cells with pcdna3.1/neo-mt and
coselecting cells in zeocin and  xxxg418xxx  for
7±10 days at which time clones were isolated
and screened for the expression of both
mrnas.
ligand binding
cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 1.5±2 
105 cells/well and incubated overnight at
378c. the media was then removed and each
washed well with ice-cold transport buffer
(trans b) (100 mm nacl, 20 mm hepes [4(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazine ethanesulfonic
acid], 25 nm nahco3, 5 mm kcl, 2 mm
cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, and 5 mm d-glucose).
two hundred microliters of ice-cold acid
saline (135 mm nacl, 20 mm hepes, 5 mm
kcl, 2 mm cacl2, 1 mm mgcl2, and 7 mmdglucose brought to ph 3.5 with glacial acetic
acid) was added and the plates kept on ice for
2 min to remove any bound folate from the
cell surface. after two additional ice-cold
washes in trans b, 200 l of [3h]-labeled
 xxxd2146xxx , [6s]-5chofh4, or mtx in trans b
were added to each well and the plates
incubated for 30 min at 48c. the concentration of ligands varied from 0.1 to 500 nm and
three wells were used at each concentration,
while a fourth well containing 100 m of
either nonradioactive  xxxd2146xxx  or  xxxd2147xxx

was used as a negative control. at the end of
30 min, the radioactive media was removed
and the wells thoroughly rinsed two times
with 1 ml of trans b at 48c. finally, 200 l of
1 n naoh was added to each well, the plates
were shaken at room temperature for 5 min
and 170-l aliquots removed and the amount
of radioactivity bound determined by scintillation counting.
[6s]-5chofh4 uptake
uptake of [3h]6s-5chofh4 was measured
according to a modification of the method of
jansen et. al. (29,30). cells were seeded into
24-well plates at approximately 1  105
cells/well and cultured overnight. prior to
use, cells were washed once at 378c with
trans b containing 107 mm nacl, 20 mm
hepes, 26.2 mm nahco3, 5.3 mm kcl,
1.9 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm mgcl2, and 7.0 mmdglucose, adjusted to ph 7.4 with naoh, and
then incubated for 30 min in the same buffer.
they were then washed three times at 378c
in trans b and uptake was initiated by the
addition of prewarmed (378c) trans b containing the appropriate amounts of radiolabeled substrate, with or without  xxxd2146xxx  or
probenecid. transport was terminated at
predetermined times by rapid removal of
radioisotope from the wells followed immediately by three washes in 0.5±1 ml trans b at
08c. cells were then washed twice in cold
300 l acid saline (135 mm nacl, 20 mm
hepes, 5.3 mm kcl, 1.9 mm cacl2, 1.0 mm
mgcl2, 7 mmd-glucose, adjusted to ph 3.5
with glacial acetic acid) to remove nonspecific
surface-bound label. after two additional
washes in ca++/mg++-free dulbecco's pbs
(dpbs), cells were harvested by dissolving in
1 n naoh and used directly for the determination of radioisotope incorporation or protein concentration.
dhfr activity
partial purification of dhfr was performed
as described (31) with minor modifications.
cell pellets containing 5  108 cells were
suspended in 3 ml of cold sample buffer
(50 mm tris-cl, ph 7.2, 50 mm kcl, 2 mm
dtt, 10% glycerol, and 1 g/ml leupeptin)
and lysed with a dounce homogenizer followed by five cycles of freezing and thawing.
after centrifugation  xxxd1891xxx ,000  g for 40 min
at 48c, the supernatant was fractionated by
268

molecular sieve chromatography using a
biorad p60 acrylamide gel column. samples
were eluted with sample buffer without
glycerol at 48c. fractions were collected and
those containing dhfr activity pooled and
stored in 15% glycerol at 808c. dhfr
activity was determined by monitoring the
decrease in absorbance at 340 nm in a
beckman du-64 spectrophotometer as
described previously (32).
results
growth in 15 pm [6s]-5chofh4 affects
folate pool size and composition and
increases antifolate sensitivity
a population of dc-3f cells selected for
growth in fa medium was used for the
isolation and expansion of three separate
clones,  xxxg760xxx , fa7, and fa14 as described
(15). the folate pool size and composition for
each of the clones was determined using the
ternary complex assay outlined in materials
and methods. compared to dc-3f cells
cultured in dmem/f12 containing 5% fbs
and >2.0 m  xxxd2146xxx , the total folate pool in
each of the clones was reduced by approximately 30-fold (table 1). in addition to
depleting the pool, however, the relative
levels of the various folate cofactors were also
significantly altered. fh2, which, during
growth in dmem/f12 accounts for approximately 0.10% of total cell folate, represented
>60% in  xxxg760xxx  and fa7 cells and >40% in
fa14. in addition, the relative amount of
5-ch3fh4 decreased from 63% in dc-3f
cells to 8% in  xxxg760xxx , while the relative amounts
of ch2fh4+ xxxd3334xxx  and 10-chofh4 did not
substantially change. similar results were
obtained for fa7 and fa14 clones as well.
when  xxxg760xxx  cells were cultured in 15 nm fa
medium for 6 days, the total folate pool
increased approximately 13-fold, but its
composition did not fully revert to that
observed in dc-3f cells cultured in dmem/
f12. although the level of 5-ch3fh4
increased toward that found in dc-3f cells,
the relative amount of fh2 remained highly
elevated, accounting for 30% of the total
folate pool (table 1).
in order to compare the fa clones with the
parental cell line for drug sensitivity, dc-3f
cells were plated in fa medium and cultured

 xxxg760xxx  cultured in 15 nm fa media for 6 days.

for 6 days to deplete the pools. as can be seen
in table 1, growth in this medium lowered
the total folate pool and altered its composition to levels similar to those noted in the
clones. a comparison of growth curves for
dc-3f and  xxxg760xxx  cells cultured in fa medium
(figure 1a) showed that they were similar for
the first 5 days; hence, the ed50 values
(table 2), measured on day 4, were determined under conditions of comparable
growth rates and pool size. the ed50's for
mtx and tmtx in dc-3f cells grown in
dmem/f12 are 26.9  0.7 and 6.4  1.0 nm,
respectively, and decrease to 12.6  3.0 and
5.5  1.0 nm after 4 days of growth in fa
medium. the ed50's for the two drugs in  xxxg760xxx 
cells grown in fa medium were very similar
to those for dc-3f cells in that medium, 12.5
 2.3 and 2.3  0.2 nm for mtx and tmtx,
respectively. since we have shown that culturing dc-3f cells in fa medium for 6 days
does not increase fr or mtii expression
levels ((16), and figure 2a), and since mtx
and tmtx do not share the same transport
routes and tmtx is not subject to polyglutamylation, the results suggest that under these
growth conditions, it is the folate pool status
that largely impacts antifolate sensitivity.
the extent to which folate repletion might
alter antifolate sensitivity was determined by
culturing the fa clones in 15 nm fa medium.
analysis of growth curves for all cell lines
confirmed that their growth rates were similar through 5 days of culture (figure 1b).
when compared to dc-3f cells in dmem/
f12, each of the clones displayed a 5-fold and
10-fold increase, respectively in the level of

resistance to mtx and tmtx (table 2).
moreover,  xxxg760xxx  cells were 10- and 27-fold
more resistant to mtx and tmtx, respectively than they were during growth in fa
medium. analysis of the folate pool size in
 xxxg760xxx  cells cultured in 15 nm fa medium for 6
days showed that it had increased 13-fold
over that found in cells grown in fa medium
(table 1). however, this increase accounts for
only 43% of the total pool in drug-sensitive
dc-3f cells growing in mem/f12. hence,
the increase in folate pool size per se cannot
explain the antifolate resistance levels displayed by  xxxg760xxx  cells growing in 15 nm fa
medium. the folate pools in fa7 and fa14
cells grown in 15 nm fa medium were not
analyzed.
fra and/or metallothionein ii
overexpression confers resistance
to tmtx, but not mtx
since mtx and tmtx are transported by
different mechanisms it is unlikely that
changes in drug transport are responsible
for the antifolate resistance noted when  xxxg760xxx 
cells are cultured in 15 nm [6s]-5chofh4.
however, uptake of [6s]-5chofh4 can be

reported that in some cell types use of this
folate can rescue cells from the effects of

mrna level approximately twice that of  xxxg760xxx 
cells (figure 2). the ligand-binding characteristics of the receptors expressed in  xxxg760xxx 
and dcfr3 cell lines are shown in table 3.
similar to mouse (33) and human fr (34),
the hamster receptor has a higher affinity
(lower kd) for [6s]-5chofh4 than for mtx,
and displays highest affinity for  xxxd2146xxx .
bmax estimates of the number of receptors
present on the cell surface gave values consistent with the fr mrna data of figure 2,
indicating that dcfr3 cells expressed fr to
a level twice that of  xxxg760xxx  cells. functionally,
this level of expression permits the growth of
dc-3f cells in 15 pm fa medium (data not
shown). moreover, overexpression of the
receptor in  xxxg760xxx  cells (figure 3) enhances
accumulation of [6s]-5chofh4 by approximately three-fold compared to dc-3f cells in
which the folate pools had been reduced to
near- xxxg760xxx  levels by culturing for 6 days in fa
media (table 1). this accumulation can be
blocked by excess  xxxd2146xxx , indicating that it
is receptor mediated. by contrast, uptake in
dc-3f cells is not blocked by  xxxd2146xxx ,
suggesting that it is likely to be mediated by
the reduced folate carrier (rfc).
to ensure that selection for growth in fa
media had not altered the rfc, the kt and
vmax for [6s]-5chofh4 and mtx transport
in dc-3f and  xxxg760xxx  cells were determined. the
influx kt for [6s]-5chofh4 in dc-3f, 2.06 
0.13m, is indistinguishable from that in
 xxxg760xxx , 2.09  0.35 m, and the kt values for
mtx, 6.79  0.35 and 7.97  0.99 m,
respectively, are not significantly different
(p > 0.5). these results are consistent with
those in figure 3 and indicate that, although
the rfc is present and active in both cell lines,
no mutations or posttranscriptional alterations that might have significantly increased
the carrier's affinity, i.e., lowered its kt, for
 xxxd2147xxx  had emerged during selection.
estimates of the v max values for [6s]5chofh4 in dc-3f and  xxxg760xxx  cells were 5.52
 0.41 and 5.81  0.08, and for mtx were 1.70
 0.1 and 1.30  0.2, pmol/min/mg protein,
respectively, indicating that little or no change
had occurred in the carrier's activity.
the ability of the receptor to affect drug
sensitivity is shown in table 4. analysis

the numbers shown represent the mean  sem from a minimum of three separate determinations. dc-3f cells were maintained in fa
media for 4 days prior to drug treatment.

transfected clone, dcve1, showed that overexpression of the receptor did not confer
resistance to mtx, but did elevate resistance
to tmtx by two-fold. similar experiments
carried out with dc-3f cells transfected with
an mtii expression vector, dcmt4, in which

or a mtii expression vector (pcdna3.1/neo-mt) or both as
described in materials and methods. a third vector (pcdna3.1/
neo) containing no insert was used as a control. in each case,
transfectants were selected for survival in the appropriate drug,
and resistant colonies were expanded and screened for
expression of the appropriate transcripts by northern blots.

15 nm fa media for 6 days; lane 6, dcfr3(mt) transfectant;
lane 7, dcfr3 transfectant. lanes 4 and 5 demonstrate that
growth of dc-3f cells in low folate for 6 days does not upregulate
endogenous fr mrna expression. the size of the fr
transcript encoded by the vector is approximately 140 nucleotides
longer than the endogenous transcript in  xxxg760xxx  cells due to
preferential use of the vector polyadenylation site which lies 140
nucleotides downstream of the site located in the cdna insert.

6 days in 15 nm fa media. lanes 6 and 7 demonstrate that
growth of dc-3f cells in low folate does not upregulate
endogenous mt mrna expression.

the level of mtii overexpression was similar to
that in  xxxg760xxx  cells (figure 2b and reference
(16)), and in a cotransfectant, dcfr3 (mt), in
which the levels of fr and mtii mrna
expression were within two-fold that of  xxxg760xxx 
(figure 2), failed to provide evidence that mt
overexpression alone or in combination with
fr confers resistance to mtx. however, a
two-fold increase in resistance to tmtx similar to that observed in the dcfr3 tranfectants
was also noted in dcmt4 cells and in the
cotransfectants as well.
dhfr activity is elevated in fa clones
a classical mechanism for acquisition of
resistance to mtx and tmtx is overexpression of the target enzyme, dhfr (2,11).
hence, we measured the level of dhfr
activity in the fa clones. as indicated in
table 5, each of them displayed a five- to sixfold increase in activity when cultured in fa
medium, and  xxxg760xxx  cells maintained this level
of activity in 15 nm fa medium as well. dc3f cells cultured in 15 nm fa medium also
showed a modest increase in dhfr activity.
southern (not shown) and northern blot
analysis (figure 4) failed to detect any
increase in dhfr gene copy or mrna levels.
however, western blots showed that the
steady state level of dhfr had been elevated
approximately five-fold in each of the fa
clones. hence, a quantitative increase in the
amount of dhfr protein had occurred by
what appears to be a posttranscriptional
mechanism. the cloning and sequencing of
10 dhfr cdnas from  xxxg760xxx  cells, four of
which were encoded by the 21k and six by
the 20k polymorphic dhfr alleles present in
these cells (35) and which encode enzymes
that do differ in their sensitivity to mtx (32),
did not reveal any newly acquired mutations.

discussion
selection of dc-3f cells for growth in 15 pm
[6s]-5chofh4 is associated with changes in
the expression level of several genes, among
which are the overexpression of metallothionein ii via a transcription-based mechanism
(16) and fr through a combination of gene
amplification and mrna stabilization (15).
although it has been reported that overexpression of mtii does not confer resistance
to mtx (21), those experiments were carried
out using standard media containing high
levels of  xxxd2146xxx . the effect on resistance to
a nonclassical antifolate such as tmtx had
not been determined. since enforced overexpression of mtii does provide enhanced
growth of dc-3f in 15 nm folate [6s]5chofh4 (16), it was of interest to determine
if similar overexpression would also provide
resistance to antifolates under those same
media folate conditions. that it does not
confer resistance to mtx but does to tmtx
(table 4) suggests that the mechanisms of
action of the two drugs, although targeted to
the same enzyme, differ. the most likely
explanation rests with the secondary effects
of mtx polyglutamates that are known to
affect the activity of folate cofactor requiring
enzymes as well as dhfr, i.e., ts and
5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (aicar) transformylase (36,37), and
thus have a broader impact on cellular
metabolism. hence, the mechanisms whereby
mt provides enhanced growth of mouse
embryo fibroblast mt i and ii null cells in
nanomolar folate, i.e., by delaying cell-cycle
arrest and apoptosis (38), while perhaps
sufficient for providing modest resistance to
tmtx are apparently ineffective in doing so for
mtx, at least in the chl cells used here.
although fr overexpression is known to
provide survival advantage in low folate (39±
272

41), its role in mediating antifolate sensitivity
is related to the  xxxd2146xxx  and the type
of folate in the media as well as the antifolate
tested (20). in the case of cho cells, enforced
overexpression of the receptor via transfection
increased mtx uptake and cytotoxicity, but
the latter only when media folate levels were
low and not in standard media containing
>2m  xxxd2146xxx  (23). similar experiments
using human breast cancer cells (22) showed
that increased receptor expression decreased
sensitivity (increased resistance) to tmtx,
presumably by increasing uptake of reduced
folates from the media, while the sensitivity to
mtx was not affected likely due to the
relatively high affinity of the human receptor
for reduced folates as opposed to mtx, as
suggested by the authors. table 3 shows that
the hamster fr has characteristics similar
to those in mouse and human in that its
relative affinity for [6s]-5chofh4 is approximately 30-fold higher than it is for mtx. not
unexpectedly, therefore, our results are similar to these previous reports and show that
in 15 nm [6s]-5chofh4, folate-receptortransfected dcfr3 cells display a modest
increase in resistance to tmtx but not mtx
as compared to dc-3f cells in standard
media (table 4). hence, a small component,
approximately 20%, of the tmtx resistance
observed in the fa clones growing in 15 nm
fa media is due to upregulation of fr
whereas there is no effect on mtx resistance. this is also seen in the dcfr3 (mt)
double transfectant (table 4) in which resistance to tmtx is elevated compared to that
of controls, but resistance to mtx is not.
that the combination of mt and fr overexpression does not additively or synergistically affect resistance to tmtx suggests that
both act through a common downstream
mechanism. similar conclusions have been
drawn concerning the molecular determi-

display increased sensitivity to antifolates
and 5-fu when grown in low folate medium
(43,44). this is associated with reduced ts
protein and activity levels as well as fdump
binding sites (44). these cells also increase
their rfc activity from two- to seven-fold, but
do not alter their folylpolyglutamate synthetase ( xxxg814xxx ) levels even though in some cases
they do show an accumulation of mtx
triglutamates. fr status was not determined.
although we have not measured ts activity
levels in the fa clones, the data in table 1
show that fh2 levels are greatly increased,
which is inconsistent with a decrease in ts
levels. moreover, we did not observe any
changes in rfc activity (see results),  xxxg814xxx 
activity (r. moran, personal communication),
or in the distribution of mtx polyglutamates
(45). nor have we been able to document any

our results differ considerably from those
reported earlier. however, it should be
pointed out that in many studies, including
those mentioned above, ``low folate'' refers
to media concentrations in the low nanomolar range, i.e., 0.5 to 2.5 nm, which, at a
minimum, is >30-fold higher than the 15
274

pm levels used here. moreover the human
cell lines did not represent clonal populations. these inconsistencies in experimental
design, in addition to the inherent biological differences between the cell lines, combined with the strong selective pressure
used to generate the fa clones, make it
difficult to draw comparisons between the
two studies. this is underscored by the fact
that none of the fa clones survive if the
media folate level is reduced to 10 pm,
indicating that the 15 pm amounts present
in fa media represent the lower limit of
exogenous folate required to support survival of chl cells.
one of the interesting findings of the
present study is the large increase in the
amount of fh2 in the intracellular folate
pools of the fa clones. although the relative
amount in  xxxg760xxx , as a percentage of the total
folate, drastically increased from <0.14% to
>60%, i.e., approximately 400-fold, the
actual level increased over 10-fold, from
<0.3. pmol/mg protein to >4.0 (table 1). this
is contrary to recent reports in which the fh2
concentration in the cho cell line aa8
decreased by 10-fold when cultured in
100 nm as opposed to 2.2 m  xxxd2146xxx ,
while its relative contribution did not appreciably change (46). although one of the
well-documented effects of dhfr targeted
antifolates is an increase in polyglutamylated
fh2 (36,37), it is not clear why selection in
15 pm [6s]-5chofh4 should result in such
a dramatic increase in fh2 levels. since the
only known mechanism for fh2 production
in mammalian cells, in the absence of the
reduction of  xxxd2146xxx  by dhfr, is through
the conversion of (6r)-5,10-ch2fh4 by ts,
these results suggest that folate depletion by
restricting media folate elevates ts activity,
or inhibits dhfr activity. the latter may be
ruled out by the results in table 5, showing
that dhfr activity is elevated in the fa
clones. a third possibility is that ts retains
its normal activity under folate stress, but
that the fh2 produced is sequestered from
dhfr and allowed to accumulate or ``segregate'' into intracellular cofactor pools by
binding to various soluble proteins as has
been suggested to occur in response to
antifolate treatment (47,48).
it has been reported that both ts (49) and
dhfr (50,51) regulate their own expression

folate depletion and antifolate resistance

through binding of their respective mrnas,
thus inhibiting translation. in the case of
dhfr, disruption of the resulting mrna
protein complex can be achieved by the
addition of fh2 or mtx (50) while for ts, it
is the addition of ump or 5,10-ch2fh4 that
can reactivate translation (49). the extent to
which ts activity can be directly or indirectly
elevated as a result of folate depletion
remains to be determined, however. interestingly, a recent report suggests that folate
depletion of human hepatoma g2 cells
activates the transcription factor  xxxg1559xxx 
(52), but the effect, if any, on ts gene
expression remains unknown. additionally,
it has been reported that ts can form a
ribonucleoprotein complex both in vitro and
in vivo with p53 mrna (53). alleviation of this
complex could result in an increase in ts
activity and elevated fh2 production, as well
as activation of p53, perhaps leading to cellcycle arrest and survival. whether this
occurs under conditions of sever folate stress
is unclear.
our data indicate that selection for growth
in 15 pm [6s]-5chofh4 results in an
increase in dhfr activity that, while unable
to provide resistance to mtx and tmtx when
cells are maintained at that folate concentration, can provide resistance upon folate
repletion. the elevation of dhfr protein
occurs in the absence of an increase in gene
copy number or mrna level, suggesting that
it is regulated by translation. the fact that
the fh2 levels in the fa clones are grossly
elevated is consistent with the translational
autoregulation model in which fh2 has been
shown to activate the translation of dhfr
mrna in vitro by disruption of a dhfr/
dhfr mrna complex (50,51). however,
experiments to rule out changes in dhfr
half-life will be required before we can conclude that translational autoregulation is
responsible for the increase in dhfr levels
in the fa clones.
moreover, other possibilities to at least
partially explain the increase in dhfr activity also exist. for example, it is has been
reported that the folding of e. coli dhfr in
the presence of elevated fh2 concentrations
increases the specific activity of the enzyme
in a manner similar to that conferred by the
molecular chaperone dnaj (54). whether the
fh2 levels in the fa clones would be

sufficient to accomplish this in vivo remains
unknown. however, if one assumes that an
average mammalian cell contains a volume of
3.4  10 9 cm3, 70% of which is water (55), it
can be estimated from previous work (56)
that the concentration of dhfr in dc-3f
cells is approximately 6.25 nm, and, in  xxxg760xxx ,
assuming a five-fold increase (figure 4), is
30 nm. based upon an average protein
content of 200 g/106 cells for dc-3f and
 xxxg760xxx  (alliegro and melera, unpublished), and
the data in table 1, which reports the
concentration of fh2 in these cells, it can be
calculated that the concentration of fh2 in
dc-3f and  xxxg760xxx  is 21 and 424 nm, respectively. given that the average kd of fh2 for the
two forms of dhfr present in dc-3f cells is
approximately 75 nm (32), it appears that the
enzyme in  xxxg760xxx  cells is operating at or above
saturating conditions and that any new dhfr
synthesized might, assuming that the substrate was assessable, be folding to its active
state in the presence of high concentrations of
fh2. whether this would enhance specific
activity or stabilize the enzyme is unclear. in
terms of the translational autoregulation
model, a 100-fold molar excess of fh2 to
dhfr protein was able to prevent the formation of the dhfr/dhfr mrna, complex in
vitro (50). whether the 15-fold excess, calculated here would be sufficient in vivo remains
to be determined.
lastly, under conditions of chronic folate
depletion, cells may undergo stress related
responses that include the expression of
molecular chaperones (57). indeed, folate
deficiency has been reported to induce oxidative stress in human cells (58), and it has
been shown that the heat shock response
protein hsp90, whose expression is upregulated under these conditions, can mediate
the folding of chicken casein kinase ii and
enhance its activity (59). in addition, upregulation of cyclophilins, a family of highly
conserved cis-trans prolyl isomerases (60),
which are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells and have been shown to promote
the folding of mouse dhfr (56), might
provide another possible mechanism for the
biosynthesis of dhfr in an activated or
perhaps stabilized form. clearly, additional
studies will be required to determine the
basis for the increase in dhfr activity in the
fa clones.
