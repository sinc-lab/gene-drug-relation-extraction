alkaline phosphatase activity in whitefly salivary
glands and saliva
c. joel funk*

usda-ars western cotton research laboratory, phoenix, arizona
alkaline phosphatase activity was histochemically localized in
adult whiteflies (bemisia tabaci b biotype, syn. b. argentifolii)
with a chromogenic substrate (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate) and a fluorogenic substrate (elf-97). the greatest
amount of staining was in the basal regions of adult salivary
glands with additional activity traced into the connecting salivary ducts. other tissues that had alkaline phosphatase activity were the accessory salivary glands, the midgut, the portion
of the ovariole surrounding the terminal oocyte, and the colleterial gland. whitefly nymphs had activity in salivary ducts,
whereas activity was not detected in two aphid species (rhodobium porosum and aphis gossypii). whitefly diet (15% sucrose) was collected from whitefly feeding chambers and found
to have alkaline phosphatase activity, indicating the enzyme
was secreted in saliva. further studies with salivary alkaline
phosphatase collected from diet indicated that the enzyme had
a ph optimum of 10.4 and was inhibited by 1 mm cysteine and
to a lesser extent 1 mm histidine. dithiothreitol, inorganic phosphate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) also inhibited activity, whereas levamisole only partially inhibited
salivary alkaline phosphatase. the enzyme was heat tolerant
and retained approximately 50% activity after a 1-h treatment
at 65°c. the amount of alkaline phosphatase activity secreted
by whiteflies increased under conditions that stimulate increased feeding. these observations indicate alkaline phosphatase may play a role during whitefly feeding. arch. insect

introduction
whiteflies, along with other members of the
suborder sternorrhyncha (homoptera), feed on
phloem sap using piercing-sucking mouthparts.
during the course of feeding, fluids are exchanged
between the insect and the host plant through
two channels formed by a set of interlocking maxillary stylets at the core of the tubular feeding
apparatus (rosell et al., 1995). the food canal directs sap from the phloem sieve elements of the
host plant into the digestive system of the insect,
whereas the salivary canal transports saliva from
the whitefly into the host plant. two types of saliva are produced and secreted by plant-sucking
homoptera while feeding. viscous saliva is secreted during the early stages of feeding and
forms the salivary sheath that surrounds and protects the mouthparts (cohen et al., 1998). watery saliva produced during penetration of plant
tissues lubricates the stylets and transports enzymes, but it may also provide a vehicle for the
elimination of nitrogenous waste and for the
transmission of plant viruses (chapman, 1998;
miles, 1999; rosell et al., 1999).
most of the current information on salivary
enzymes from sternorrhynchan insects has been
derived from studies of aphids. enzymes present
in aphid saliva include pectinases (pectinesterase
and polygalacturonase), oxidases (polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase), and possibly cellulase, amylase, and sucrase (ma et al., 1990; urbanska et
al., 1998; miles, 1999). these enzymes can aid in
host plant penetration, induce an increase in phloem sap flow, generate and degrade plant wound
messengers, detoxify plant defensive phytochemicals, and cause plant necrosis (miles, 1999).
although relatively little is known about the
components of whitefly saliva, salivary gland secretions are involved in the formation of the salivary sheath (cohen et al., 1998), transmission of
plant viruses (rosell et al., 1999), and likely contain various enzymes. it has been possible to study
salivary components of larger hemipteran and homopteran insects from dissected salivary glands
or by collecting relatively large amounts of saliva
(madhusudhan et al., 1994; baumann and baumann, 1995). however, the small size of the
bemisia tabaci whitefly (<1 mm) makes characterization of salivary-specific enzymes more diffi-

cult and, therefore, other methods are needed to
study salivary glands and secretions.
in this report, light microscopy and sensitive
microassays were used to detect and characterize
an alkaline phosphatase (alp) in the whitefly
salivary gland and saliva. in addition, alp activity was localized in several other whitefly tissues
including the accessory salivary gland, gut, ovariole, and colleterial gland. alps are characterized by their ability to hydrolyze orthophosphate
monoesters at alkaline ph and are commonly
found in animals, fungi, and bacteria (eguchi,
1995; oshima, 1997; lee et al., 1999). insect alps
have been described from several sources and appear to have diverse roles in absorption, development, and cuticle formation (reviewed by eguchi,
1995). the presence of alp in whitefly saliva is
an indication that this enzyme may have a role
in whitefly feeding.
materials and methods
chemicals
dithiothreitol (dtt) was purchased from
biorad (hercules, ca), k2hpo4 was purchased
from mallinckrodt (paris, kentucky), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (edta) was purchased
from gibco-brl (rockville, md). unless indicated
otherwise, all other reagents were obtained from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, mo).
insects
bemisia tabaci gennadius b biotype (syn. b.
argentifolii perring and bellows) whiteflies were collected from a greenhouse colony reared on cotton
plants (gossypium hirsutum l.) or field collected
on melon. the giant whitefly (aleurodicus dugesii
cockerell) was collected on the campus of uc irvine,
irvine, ca. yellow rose aphids (rhodobium porosum
sanderson) and cotton aphids (aphis gossypii
glover) were obtained from laboratory colonies
maintained on tea rose (rosa indica l.) and cotton
plants (g. hirsutum), respectively.
microscopy techniques
whiteflies (adults and nymphs) and aphids
were collected in 70% ethanol or acetone, fixed overnight in ethanolic formaldehyde (3:1 ratio), dehydrated through a graded ethanol series, and
infiltrated and embedded in paraffin (fukatsu and

whitefly salivary alkaline phosphatase

nikoh, 1998). serial sections of 10-µm thickness
were mounted on glass slides, de-paraffinized, and
hydrated through a xylene- xxxd102xxx water series and
stained for alkaline phosphatase using either a chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (bcip) with nitro blue tetrazolium (nbt)
(promega corp., madison, wi) or a fluorogenic substrate, elf-97 (molecular probes inc., eugene, or).
the bcip/nbt labeling reaction contained 0.17 mg/
ml bcip and 0.33 mg/ml nbt in an alkaline reaction buffer (100 mm tris-hcl, ph 9.5, 100 mm
nacl, 5 mm mgcl2). the elf-97 labeling reaction
was performed with the elf-97 endogenous phosphatase detection kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions with a 1:20 dilution of elf-97
in elf-97 developing buffer (provided in the kit).
sections stained with bcip/nbt were examined
and photographed using brightfield optics on an
olympus ck40 or a zeiss axioskop. sections stained
with elf-97 were visualized and photographed on
a zeiss axioskop using an epifluorescence illuminator and a filter set with excitation at 365 nm and
emission at ≥420 nm.
whitefly saliva collection
unless otherwise noted, adult whiteflies were
fed 15% sucrose in 100 mm 2-(n-morpholino)
ethanesulfonic acid (mes) buffer (ph 6.5) on a
whitefly feeding chamber that has been described
elsewhere (salvucci, 2000). whiteflies in the apparatus fed through a teflon™ filter membrane with
a 1-µm pore size (osmonics, minnetonka, mn).
each feeding chamber could accommodate approximately 400 feeding adult whiteflies. the sucrose
solution that contained salivary secretions was collected from three feeding chambers after a 2-day
feeding period. the sucrose solution was diluted
with milliq water (millipore), and concentrated to
approximately 80 µl using centricon-30 concentrators (millipore) with a 30-kda mw cut-off. purified bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa) was added to the
solution in the concentrators (to a final concentration of approximately 0.25 mg/ml) to aid in protein
stabilization and prevent non-specific binding to the
concentrator. the bsa solution did not have detectable alp activity when tested separately.
alkaline phosphatase assays
alkaline phosphatase assays were conducted
in 96-well plates using one of two assay systems.

167

a colorometric assay was used to determine the
optimal ph range of salivary alp with  xxxd2822xxx  ( xxxd2822xxx ) as the substrate.
equal volume aliquots of the concentrated whitefly diet (6–12 µl) were added to each well. one
of several buffers was added to give a final concentration of 100 mm: n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes), ph 7.0;
n-tris (hydroxymethyl) methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid (taps), ph 8.0–9.0; 2-n- cyclohexylamino ethanesulfonic acid (ches), ph 9.0–10.0;
3-(cyclohexylamino)-1- propanesulfonic acid (caps)
ph 9.7–11.0. the reaction was started by the addition of 138 µl of a  xxxd2822xxx  solution (3 mm  xxxd2822xxx ,
0.05 mm mgcl2) to give a final volume of 200 µl
per well. absorbance readings were taken at 405
nm on a microtiter plate spectrophotometer (spectramax 250, molecular devices, sunnyvale, ca).
a fluorescent phosphatase substrate, attophos®
(promega corp., madison, wi) was used in all
other assays. the fluorescent assays were initiated by the addition of 100 µl of 2.9 mm attophos®
in the buffer provided by the manufacturer (2.4
m diethanolamine; 0.057 mm mgcl2, ph 10.0) to
give a final volume of 150 µl per well. readings
were taken on a microtiter plate spectrofluorometer (micromax/fluoromax-2; instruments s.a.,
inc, edison, nj) at 430 nm excitation, 560 nm
emission. assay plates for both systems were incubated at 28°c and readings were taken over a
2- to 5-day period. to determine the effect of various amino acids (cys, his, leu, met, phe, tyr,
and  xxxd1576xxx  [har]) and other inhibitors
(levamisole, dtt, edta, and k2hpo4) on activity, aqueous solutions of the inhibitors were added
at the indicated concentration just prior to adding the substrate. the effect of heat treatment
was determined by preincubation of the enzyme
at the specified times and temperatures in 100
mm mes (ph 6.5) or 100 mm ches (ph 10.0).
the heat-treated enzyme was then assayed with
attophos® using the manufacturer’s buffer (ph
10.0) as stated above.
whitefly alp secretion
the amount of salivary alp produced by
adult whiteflies was compared between groups of
whiteflies on feeders. whitefly feeders were
loaded to capacity (approximately 400 whiteflies/
feeder) and given one of three diet treatments:

168

funk

standard diet (15% sucrose), 3% sucrose diet, or
15% diet with 0.5 mm pilocarpine. the number
of feeding whiteflies was counted at the end of
the 2-day feeding period and used to adjust the
reading for an equivalent number of whiteflies.
results
histochemical localization of alp activity
whitefly alp activity was detected in paraffin sections using chromogenic (bcip-nbt) and
fluorogenic (elf-97) substrates (fig. 1). the
greatest amount of activity, as observed by staining intensity, was present in adult whitefly primary salivary glands (fig. 1a,b). the accessory
salivary gland also stained for alp activity in
some whiteflies; however, it was more difficult to
locate in whitefly sections because of its small
size (fig. 1d). within the primary salivary gland,
activity was centralized in distinct regions of the
basal portion of the gland with some additional
punctate staining in the surrounding salivary tissue. in addition, alp activity could be followed
in serial section from salivary glands into the salivary ducts (fig. 1b). activity was also present in
the y-shaped salivary ducts of whitefly nymphs
(fig. 1c). in addition to b. tabaci, several other
sternorrhynchan species were tested for activity.
the salivary gland of the adult giant whitefly
showed activity, although the staining was much
less intense than for b. tabaci (not shown). paraffin sections of the yellow rose aphid and the cotton aphid were prepared and stained using the
same protocol, but neither species stained positive
for alp activity in the salivary glands or ducts.
several other tissues of adult whiteflies
stained positive for alp activity. the midgut, the
colleterial gland, and the portion of the ovariole
surrounding the terminal oocyte all stained positive for alp activity in various whitefly sections
(fig. 1d). the alp activity in these tissues was
not present in all sections in which the tissues were
present and, therefore, the presence of alp may
depend on the physiological state of the insect.
whitefly saliva alp
the presence of alp activity in salivary
ducts suggested that whitefly saliva contained
alp activity and, therefore, would be egested into
a whitefly diet. sucrose diet was collected from a

feeding chamber after adult whiteflies had fed on
the solution and was concentrated. in a preliminary assay, the concentrate tested positive for
alp activity (not shown). salivary alp was collected from multiple feeding chambers and used
for further studies.
the ph optimum for salivary alp was determined using several good’s buffers (ferguson et
al., 1980) to cover the ph range in which alps
normally have optimal activity. an initial survey
of the ph 8.0–11.0 range indicated that optimal
activity was present between ph 10.0 and ph 10.5
(not shown). in addition, alp activity could be detected at ph 7.0 (the approximate ph of phloem
sap) using 100 mm hepes buffer (not shown).
although the peak was broad, the ph optimum
for adult whitefly salivary alp was centered
around ph 10.4 using 100 mm caps (fig. 2).
inhibitors of whitefly alp
amino acids have been used to characterize a
number of mammalian and insect alps (eguchi,
1995), and the effect of several amino acids on
whitefly alp activity was tested. cysteine, at a concentration of 1 mm, strongly inhibited whitefly alp,
whereas histidine reduced the amount of activity
by about 40% (fig. 3). lowering the concentration
of cysteine to 100 µm or 10 µm resulted in an increase in alp activity to 25 and 90%, respectively,
compared to controls. all other amino acids tested
(leu, met, phe, tyr, and har) resulted in changes
of ≤20% compared to whitefly alp alone (fig. 3).
other inhibitors and conditions were tested
for their effect on alp activity. whitefly alp activity was reduced to 46% by 1 mm inorganic
phosphate, 1 mm dtt reduced activity to 10%,
and 0.01 mm edta reduced activity to 17% (fig.

4). levamisole, an inhibitor of vertebrate alps
(van belle, 1976), did not reduce whitefly alp
activity at a 1 mm concentration, but 10 mm
levamisole inhibited activity to 49%. the stability of whitefly alp to heat treatment depended
on the ph of the buffer during the treatment period (prior to the alp assay). whitefly alp activity was reduced to 5% after a 56°c heat
treatment at ph 10.0 (fig. 5). however, at ph
6.5, the enzyme was more heat stable. a 20-min

treatment at 65°c resulted in a partial loss of
activity, but even after 1 h at 65°c, approximately
50% of the activity remained.

effect of sucrose concentration and

since alp was secreted by adult whiteflies
while feeding, the influence of diet on alp secretion could be determined. a diet with a reduced

whitefly alp samples were resuspended in 100 mm ches
(ph 10.0) or 100 mm mes (ph 6.5) and were treated for the

treated enzyme were assayed for activity with the fluorogenic

2-fold increase in whitefly alp compared to the
standard diet of 15% sucrose (fig. 6). pilocarpine
is a cholinergic agonist and has previously been
used to stimulate salivation from insects (madhusudhan et al., 1994). the addition of pilocarpine
to the 15% sucrose diet resulted in a 9-fold increase
in alp activity compared to the standard diet.
discussion
alkaline phosphatase is the first enzyme to
be localized in whitefly salivary glands and detected in secreted saliva. salivary alp produced
intense staining in paraffin sections of salivary
glands and ducts in nymph and adult whiteflies,
but not in aphids. this presence of activity in paraffin sections may reflect the inherent stability
of the enzyme since activity remained after the
harsh conditions during fixation and paraffin embedding. adult whiteflies secreted alp in saliva
and the amount of alp could be increased with a
low sucrose diet or under conditions that increase
salivation (pilocarpine stimulation). although the
specific substrate(s) for whitefly salivary alp
have not been identified, these observations indicate that the enzyme may play a role during
whitefly feeding.
several other insect alps have been characterized, including those from bombyx mori,

drosophila melanogaster, ceratitis capitata (mediterranean fruitfly), culex tarsalis (mosquito), and
schistocerca americana (grasshopper) (harper
and armstrong, 1974; houk and hardy, 1984;
yamamoto et al., 1991; bourtzis et al., 1993;
chang et al., 1993; eguchi, 1995; yang et al.,
2000). however, most of the characterized insect
alps have not been from salivary glands. alkaline phosphatases have been detected in salivary
glands of a lygaeus sp. (kumar et al., 1980) and
periplanta americana (srivastava and saxena,
1967), but localization of enzyme activity in salivary glands does not always indicate that the activity is also secreted in saliva. for example, an
acid phosphatase was detected in salivary gland
extract of mictis profana (hemiptera) but was not
present in saliva (taylor and miles, 1994).
the range of inhibitors tested in alp studies has varied widely and, therefore, not all of
the characteristics reported here can be directly
compared with other alps. however the data
gathered thus far indicate some important characteristics that distinguish whitefly salivary alp.
the amino acids that inhibited whitefly alp, cys,

172

funk

and his, were the same as those that inhibited
one of the two silkworm alps isolated from midgut tissue (yamamoto et al., 1991). alp from d.
melanogaster is also inhibited by cys (harper and
armstrong, 1973), whereas tyr inhibited the c.
capitata isozyme (bourtzis et al., 1993). in contrast,
many mammalian alps are inhibited by phe, leu,
or har (stigbrand and fishman, 1984). inhibition
of whitefly alp by edta reflects the role of metal
cations in maintaining alp activity and structure
(eguchi, 1995). two silkworm alps were inactivated by edta, but activity could be partially
restored by the addition of mg++ and zn++ (yamamoto et al., 1991). further evidence for the role of
 xxxd2531xxx  in alp activity has come from
the identification of metal binding sites in the crystal structure of the e. coli enzyme (sowadski et
al., 1985). the conserved amino acids that are responsible for zinc and magnesium binding are also
present in the b. mori and d. melanogaster alp
cdna sequences that have been published (itoh et
al., 1999; yang et al., 2000). whitefly and c. capitata alps were inhibited by reducing agents,
whereas culex alp was stimulated (houk and
hardy, 1984; bourtzis et al., 1993).
levamisole has been used to characterize a
number of alps. mammalian liver, bone, and kidney alkaline phosphatases are inhibited by levamisole to a greater degree than the enzyme from
intestine (van belle, 1976; goldstein et al., 1980).
whitefly salivary alp activity was reduced to
about 50% by 10 mm levamisole, which is similar to the effect of levamisole on several mammalian intestinal alps (goldstein et al., 1980).
the response of alps to heat treatment can
vary widely. it took 1 to 66 min of 65°c heat treatment to attain 50% inhibition of a number of
mammalian intestinal alps (goldstein et al.,
1980). whitefly alp was resistant to heat treatment, with a 60-min exposure to 65°c resulting
in only 50% inhibition. although whitefly alp has
optimal activity at an alkaline ph, the enzyme
was much more sensitive to heat treatment in alkaline conditions than at a lower ph. the reduced
activity is likely due to denaturation of alp
caused by the combination of high temperature
and alkaline conditions. the ph of saliva and tissues within the salivary and intestinal systems
(locations where salivary alp may be present)
have not been determined. however, sorbitol may

prevent heat denaturation of salivary alp in
whiteflies during high temperature conditions
(wolfe et al., 1998; salvucci, 2000). not all insect
alps are heat resistant as indicated by two c.
capitata isozymes: one isozyme ( xxxg203xxx ) was heat
resistant, whereas the other one (alp2) was not
(bourtzis et al., 1993). since only minute amounts
of alp can be recovered from saliva, further characterization of the enzyme will likely require
purification from whitefly homogenates. the response of salivary alp to each of the inhibitors
will be useful in differentiating it from other
whitefly alp isozymes during purification.
although alps are ubiquitous enzymes with
wide substrate specificity (any substrate with a
phosphomonoester) and are found in organisms
from bacteria to higher vertebrates, they may have
specific roles in the organisms and tissues in
which they are expressed. for example, vertebrate
 xxxg148xxx  ( xxxg148xxx )
has a role in  xxxd2716xxx -6 metabolism and bone
mineralization as determined by a knock-out
mouse model (waymire et al., 1995; narisawa et
al., 1997). evidence suggests that the role of insect alps are diverse. two silkworm gut isozymes,
a membrane-bound form (m-alp) and a soluble
form (s-alp), may be involved in absorption and
transport in the gut (eguchi, 1995). in addition,
b. mori s-alp has atpase activity that may be
involved in alkalinization of the midgut lumen in
lepidoptera insects (azuma et al., 1991). other insect alps have been implicated in roles in insect
development, neural and renal function, and cuticle sclerotization (harper and armstrong, 1974;
chang et al., 1993; yang et al., 2000).
the presence of alp activity in several whitefly tissues suggests that one possible role of alp
may be in the sclerotization process of whitefly
structures. although the alp in each location may
represent a different isozyme, three of the tissues
in which alp is expressed are involved in producing structures that are hardened or sclerotized.
specifically, these tissues are (1) the salivary
gland, which secretes the gel-like saliva that becomes the hardened salivary sheath, (2) the colleterial gland, which secretes the glue used to
attach eggs to the host plant leaf, and (3) the ovariole surrounding the terminal oocyte, which is
the location where the egg chorion is formed and
begins to harden. the situation in whiteflies may

whitefly salivary alkaline phosphatase

be similar to that in d. melanogaster in which
tyrosine is stored in hemolymph as tyrosine-ophosphate (lunan and mitchell, 1969). during cuticle formation, alp hydrolyzes the phosphate
moiety and makes tyrosine available for conversion to catecholamines that are used to cross-link
proteins during sclerotization (harper and armstrong, 1972, 1974; hopkins and kramer, 1992).
evidence for this possible role of whitefly alp will
require further investigation, including determination of whether soluble tyrosine-o-phosphate is
present in whiteflies as it is in drosophila (lunan
and mitchell, 1969).
whitefly alp secretion increased when the
diet sucrose concentration was reduced to 3%. it
has previously been shown, using a radiolabeled
tracer, that the volume of ingested feeding solution increases when the concentration of sucrose
is reduced to 3% (salvucci et al., 1997). whiteflies require a sucrose concentration of between
5 and 10% for maximum rates of metabolism
while feeding (salvucci and crafts-brandner,
2000) and, therefore, the increase in diet consumption is necessary to maintain respiration
rates. the present study indicates that salivary
alp production, and therefore by implication the
amount of saliva secreted, also increases in proportion to the amount of diet consumed. the
stimulation of saliva secretion by pilocarpine further confirms that alp can be used as a marker
enzyme for whitefly saliva and indicates that pilocarpine could provide a means to generate greater
quantities of other salivary enzymes.
the effect of salivary alp on plant tissue
after egestion is not known, but if alp elicits a
response from the plant, it likely occurs at the
much lower ph of plant sap (near neutral) than
the optimal ph of salivary alp. it is generally
assumed that when plant damage is induced by
a sternorrhynchan insect in the absence of virus
transmission, the damage is caused by a component of the insect saliva (miles, 1999). feeding
by silverleaf whitefly nymphs in the absence of
virus transmission can cause plant damage in the
form of tomato irregular ripening and the squash
silverleaf syndrome (brown et al., 1995). although
these phytotoxic disorders are likely caused by a
component of saliva, the specific inducing agent
has not been identified. therefore, it will be of
continuing interest to determine the composition

173

of whitefly saliva and understand the possible role
that enzymes, such as salivary alp, may have in
causing plant damage.
