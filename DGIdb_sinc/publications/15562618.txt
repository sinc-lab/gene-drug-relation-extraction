abstract: we have compared the inhibitor sensitivities of  xxxg2310xxx  (topi) from leishmania donovani promastigotes and tops i and ii of human monocytes using pentavalent and trivalent antimonials (sbv, sbiii) and classical top inhibitors.
bis-benzimidazoles (hoechst-33258 and -33342) were potent inhibitors of both parasite and human topi, but hoechst-33342
was markedly less cytotoxic to promastigotes than to monocytes in vitro. leishmania donovani was also considerably less sensitive
than monocytes to  xxxd412xxx , both at enzyme and cellular levels.  xxxd3220xxx  (ssg) was the only antimonial to
inhibit topi, exhibiting a significant (p , 0.05) 3-fold greater potency against the l. donovani enzyme but showed low cytotoxicities against intact promastigotes. the sbv meglumine antimoniate failed to inhibit topi and showed negligible cytotoxicities,
whereas sbiii drugs were lethal to parasites and monocytes yet poor inhibitors of topi. monocyte topii was inhibited by bisbenzimidazoles and insensitive to antimonials and  xxxd412xxx . the disparity between the high leishmanicidal activity and low
anti-topi potency of sbiii indicates that in vivo targeting of l. donovani topi by the reductive pathway of antimonial activation
is improbable. nevertheless, the potent direct inhibition of topi by ssg and the differential interactions of  xxxd412xxx  with
l. donovani and human topi support the possibility of developing parasite-specific derivatives.

the cutaneous, mucocutaneous, and visceral forms of leishmaniasis caused by around 20 different species of the parasitic
protozoan leishmania collectively constitute some of the most
debilitating and widespread of human tropical diseases (herwaldt, 1999; desjeux, 2001). drugs containing pentavalent antimony (sbv) have provided the core of clinical antileishmanial
therapy for more than 50 yr, but their future efficacy is threatened by treatment failure because of the emergence of antimonial-resistant parasites (jackson et al., 1990; ibrahim et al.,
1994; farault-gambarelli et al., 1997; sundar, 2001). although
miltefosine has demonstrated efficacy as a novel treatment for
visceral leishmaniasis (jha et al., 1999), antimonials remain the
mainstay of future chemotherapeutic defense against
(muco)cutaneous diseases because of the lack of novel agents
and limitations of existing second-line drugs (ouellette and papadopoulou, 1993; herwaldt, 1999).
despite the heavy reliance upon antimonial-based therapy,
little is known regarding the specific mode(s) of drug action
apart from a proposed mechanism for in vivo activation of sbv
through reductive conversion (inside the host macrophage or
intracellular amastigote) to the active species, trivalent antimony (sbiii) (roberts et al., 1995; sereno et al., 1998; ephros
et al., 1999; shaked-mishan et al., 2001). sbv is known to bind
to several leishmania spp. proteins (berman and grogl, 1988),
but this does not exclude high-affinity targeting of key protein(s), and indeed, leishmania spp. dna topoisomerase enzymes (tops) have recently been suggested as potential sites
of action. the sbv-drug  xxxd3220xxx  (ssg) has been
reported as a selective inhibitor of leishmania donovani topi
activity in vitro (chakraborty and majumder, 1988), and a positive correlation was found between the in vitro susceptibilities
of leishmania (viannia) panamensis strains to sbv and the formation of cleavable dna–protein complexes indicative of top
inhibition (lucumi et al., 1998). in addition, the cytotoxic effect
of sbiii on leishmania infantum axenic amastigotes is associated with fragmentation of the parasites’ dna (sereno et al.,

received 17 november 2003; revised 8 march 2004; accepted 8
march 2004.

2001), a type of damage resulting typically from top inhibition.
tops mediate topological changes in dna that are essential
for nucleic acid biosynthesis and cell division (burri et al.,
1996) and have already been exploited as targets for clinical
drugs including antibacterial and antitumor agents (liu, 1989;
hooper, 1998). the tops i and ii enzymes of leishmania spp.
and other kinetoplastids are attractive targets for selective inhibition because they exhibit structural and biochemical differences from mammalian tops and have putative roles in organizing the unique kinetoplast dna (kdna) network (burri et
al., 1996; cheesman, 2000). the ability of certain top poisons
to induce cleavable-complex formation and cell death in kinetoplastids (including leishmania spp.) has increased interest
in designing parasite-specific derivatives (shapiro et al., 1989;
bodley and shapiro, 1995). in this study, we have evaluated
leishmania spp. topi as a target for selective drug action
through analysis of the relative inhibitory effects of sbv- and
sbiii-containing drugs and known anti-top agents upon the catalytic activities of l. donovani nuclear topi and human monocyte tops i and ii, in parallel with cytotoxicity testing of promastigotes and host cells.
materials and methods
drugs
additive-free preparations of meglumine antimoniate (lot no.
bl09186) and ssg (lot no. bl06916) were obtained as powdered formulations from the walter reed army institute (washington, d.c.), and
trivalent antimonyl sodium gluconate was provided by the london
school of hygiene and tropical medicine (lshtm), london, u.k.
potassium antimony (iii) tartrate (tartar emetic) was purchased from
sigma chemical co. (st. louis, missouri). antimonial drug concentrations were calculated in terms of both micromolar concentrations (mm)
and microgram per milliliter (mg ml21) of antimony (sbv/sbiii) using the
following molecular weight (mr) data: sbv/sbiii, mr 122; ssg, mr 746;
meglumine antimoniate, mr 384; antimonyl sodium gluconate, mr 337;
potassium antimony tartrate, mr 325. stock antimonial drug solutions
were prepared in ultrapure water for ic50 (the concentration of drug
required to cause 50% inhibition) assays or phosphate-buffered saline
(pbs) for 50% effective dose (ed50) tests, sterilized by filtration, and
either used immediately or stored at 270 c until required. the topi

g, 30 min). the clear supernatant fraction (nuclear extract) containing
topi activity was used immediately or stored in liquid nitrogen.

biological material

topi activity assay

the human promonocytic cell line u-937 (american type culture
collection crl-159302) was cultured in roswell park memorial institute 1640 medium as described (sundstrom and nilsson, 1976). monocytes were harvested during the logarithmic stage of growth (72 hr after
subculture) and stored in liquid nitrogen until required. promastigotes
of l. donovani (mhom/in/80/dd8), l. (v.) panamensis (mhcom/
co/86/1166), and l. (v.) braziliensis (hom/br/75/m2903) were cultured in schneider drosophila medium containing 10% heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (gibco, grand island, new york). logarithmicphase parasites were routinely harvested at 72 hr after subculture and
stored in liquid nitrogen until required.

the  xxxd83xxx  (atp)–independent relaxation of supercoiled dna, a reaction catalyzed exclusively by topi, was measured
using the assay system of topogen inc. with modifications. the standard reaction mixture for monocyte nuclear topi contained, in a final
volume of 20 ml: 10 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.9), 1 mm edta, 150 mm
nacl, 0.1% bsa, 0.1 mm spermidine, 5% glycerol, 0.25 mg supercoiled
phot-1 plasmid dna, and 1 ml of nuclear extract (diluted as required
in tep buffer). for assays of leishmania spp. nuclear topi, the reaction mixture was a modification of that of chakraborty et al. (1993) and
contained in a final volume of 20 ml: 12.5 mm tris–hcl (ph 7.5), 17.5
mm mgcl2, 50 mm kcl, 30 mg ml21 bsa, 0.1 mm spermidine, 0.5
mm dtt, 5% glycerol, 0.25 mg supercoiled phot-1 plasmid dna, and
1–4 ml of undiluted nuclear extract. topi reactions were incubated at
37 c for 30 min and then terminated by the addition of 4 ml stop buffer–
gel loading dye (5% sarkosyl, 0.125% bromophenol blue, 25% glycerol). for the majority of assays, terminated reaction mixtures were
analyzed by electrophoresis at 100 v on 1% agarose gels in tae running buffer (40 mm tris–acetate, 1 mm edta, ph 8.0) containing 0.5
mg ml21 ethidium bromide ( xxxg677xxx ), to enable quantitation of the relaxed
plasmid dna reaction product which has a higher mobility than the
substrate under these conditions. in experiments to monitor the production of relaxation intermediates by topi, gels were prepared and run
using tbe buffer (90 mm tris–borate, 2 mm edta) and then stained
overnight in 0.5 mg ml21  xxxg677xxx . the authentic topi product was run as
a marker on all gels.  xxxg677xxx -stained gels were photographed under uv
illumination using a geldoct 2000 gel documentation system
(biorad, hercules, california). the percent relaxation of supercoiled
dna substrate was determined by densitometric analyses of supercoiled
substrate and relaxed dna product bands on digital gel images using
quantity onet software. one unit of topi activity is defined as the
amount of enzyme required to catalyze 50% relaxation of supercoiled
plasmid dna in 30 min at 37 c under standard assay conditions; the
activity unit was determined by assaying serial dilutions of each nuclear
extract and then calculating the enzyme dilution giving 50% substrate
relaxation.

preparation of nuclear extracts of monocytes containing tops i
and ii activities
nuclear extracts were prepared from 1–3 3 107 monocytes using a
modification of the standard salt-lysis procedure (trask and muller,
1983; topogen inc., columbus, ohio). all steps were performed at
0–4 c. cells were pelleted by centrifugation (800 g, 5 min), and resuspended in 2 ml temp buffer (10 mm tris–hcl ph 7.5, 1 mm
ethylenediamine n, n9-tetraacetic acid [edta], 0.5 mm phenylmethyl
sulphonyl fluoride [pmsf], 4 mm mgcl2). protease inhibitor cocktail
(pic; sigma) was included at a concentration of 20 ml of 103 concentrated pic stock per milliliter of temp buffer. after recentrifugation
(as above) and resuspension in 2 ml of temp, cells were disrupted by
6 cycles of sonication using a misonix model xl2015y sonicatort
fitted with a one-sixteenth inch microtip probe under the following conditions: duty cycle 5 50% (0.5 s); power output 5 25–30%; 1 cycle 5
30 s sonication and 60 s rest. nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation
(1,500 g, 15 min), and the postnuclear supernatant fraction was removed. nuclei were washed with 1 ml of temp, recentrifuged (as
above), resuspended in 3 pellet volumes (usually 60–80 ml) of tep
buffer (as temp buffer, but without mgcl2) and then lysed by the
addition of an equal volume of 1 m nacl. after incubation on ice for
60 min with periodic mixing, the nuclear lysate was centrifuged
(16,000 g, 30 min). the clear supernatant fraction was recovered, and
chromosomal dna was precipitated by the addition of a one-third volume of a solution of tep buffer–1 m nacl (1:1, v/v), containing 18%
(wt/v)  xxxd2982xxx  (peg) and 18% (v/v) glycerol. after incubation on ice for 30 min with periodic mixing, this solution was centrifuged (16,000 g, 30 min). the clear supernatant fraction (termed nuclear extract) contained tops i and ii activities and was used immediately or stored in liquid nitrogen until required.
preparation of nuclear extracts of leishmania promastigotes
containing topi activity
nuclear extracts of were prepared from 1–5 3 109 3-day leishmania
spp. promastigotes by a modification of previous methods (andrews
and faller, 1991; tosh et al., 1999). all procedures were performed at
0–4 c. promastigotes were pelleted by centrifugation (1,500 g, 5 min),
and resuspended in n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n9-2-ethanesulfonic
acid (hepes) buffer (hepes-koh, 10 mm, ph 7.9, 1.5 mm mgcl2,
10 mm kcl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol [dtt], 0.2 mm pmsf, 0.23 pic).
after recentrifugation (as above), promastigotes were resuspended in
800 ml hepes buffer per 1 3 109 promastigotes, incubated on ice for
10 min, and then lysed by 2 cycles of gentle sonication as follows: duty
cycle 5 50% (0.5 s); power output 5 15–20%; and 1 cycle 5 30 s
sonication and 60 s rest. nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation
(16,000 g, 5 min), and the postnuclear supernatant fraction was removed. the nuclear pellet obtained from 1 3 109 promastigotes was
resuspended in 100 ml of topi extraction buffer (tris–hcl, 12.5 mm,
ph 7.5, 10 mm mgcl2, 50 mm kcl, 30 mg ml21 bovine  xxxg124xxx 
(bsa), 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm dtt, 0.2 mm pmsf, and pic at the
standard concentration) and lysed on ice by repeated passage through
a 25-gauge needle using a hamilton syringe. after centrifugation of the
nuclear lysate (16,000 g, 30 min), the supernatant fraction was recovered and mixed with a one-third volume of topi extraction buffer containing 18% (wt/v) peg 18% (v/v) glycerol. the lysate was incubated
on ice for 60 min with periodic agitation and then centrifuged (16,000

topii activity assay
the characteristic atp-dependent kdna-decatenating activity of
topii was determined using the assay method of topogen inc. the
standard reaction mixture for monocyte nuclear topii contained, in a
final volume of 20 ml: 50 mm tris–hcl (ph 8.0), 120 mm kcl, 10
mm mgcl2, 1.5 mm atp; 0.5 mm dtt, 30 mg ml21 bsa, 0.15 mg
kdna and 1 ml nuclear extract (diluted as required in temp buffer).
topii reactions were carried out at 37 c for 30 min and terminated as
described for topi assays. electrophoretic analyses of the reaction mixtures on 1% agarose gels with the tae– xxxg677xxx  buffer system enabled
quantitation of the reaction products (decatenated open circular [doc]
and decatenated closed circular [dcc] plasmid dna, respectively). authentic doc and dcc plasmid dna were run as markers on gels. one
unit of topii activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to
catalyze 50% decatenation of kdna in 30 min at 37 c under standard
assay conditions and was calculated as outlined for topi.
protein determination
protein was determined using a modified bradford assay method (ramagli and podriguez, 1985).
top inhibition assays (ic50 assays)
tops i and ii activities were measured at a minimum of 4 different
drug concentrations relative to uninhibited controls. ic50 of top activity
in the standard assays was determined graphically. inhibitors were dissolved in sterile ultrapure water or, in the case of  xxxd412xxx , dimethylsulphoxide and preincubated with the dna substrate in the standard
reaction mixture for 3 min at 37 c before the addition of nuclear extract
to start the reaction (bell et al., 1993; dykstra et al., 1994). the final
concentration of solvent was maintained below 5% (v/v) in all reaction
mixtures.

cytotoxicity assays (ed50 tests)
drug cytoxicities were determined as ed50 values using acid phosphatase activity as an indicator of cellular viability (bodley et al., 1995).
logarithmic-phase monocytes and promastigotes were cultured and harvested (at 48 hr) as described above, washed twice in eagle minimal
medium (mem) or pbs respectively, resuspended in appropriate medium (mem or schneider), and samples of 100 ml (containing 2 3 106
cells) were added to 96-well microplates. aliquots (100 ml) of medium
containing serial dilutions of test drug (in pbs) were added to cells,
and the plates were incubated for 48 hr at 26 c (promastigotes) or 37
c (monocytes). the phosphatase activity of surviving cells was determined by the addition of 20 ml of lysis buffer containing p-nitrophenyl
phosphate (10 mg ml21 solution in 1 m sodium acetate, ph 5.5/1%
triton x-100). incubation was continued for a further 6 hr at 37 c,
whereupon the production of  xxxd2821xxx  was determined by optical
density measurements at 405 nm. untreated control cells and reagent
blanks were included in all experiments. calibration curve data confirmed the linear relationship between cell numbers and phosphatase
activity, and ed50 values were calculated by probit analyses (atchinson
and silvey, 1957).
statistical analysis
leishmania donovani and monocyte ic50 and ed50 data (mean 6
sem) were evaluated by the analysis of variance or mann–whitney
tests, and differences of p , 0.05 were significant.

results
characterization of nuclear topi activities in leishmania
spp. promastigotes and human monocytes
using the tae– xxxg677xxx  electrophoresis system, topi activities
were detected by the conversion of supercoiled plasmid dna
to the higher-mobility relaxed dna product (fig. 1). it is notable that in contrast to monocytes, l. donovani nuclear extracts
produced significant levels of nicked dna in addition to relaxed dna (fig. 1). our unsuccessful attempts to suppress the
dna-nicking activity in parasite extracts using transfer rna
(type x from baker’s yeast; sigma) indicate that the nicking
is not due to an interfering nuclease. after electrophoresis in
the absence of  xxxg677xxx , topi activities were observed by the production of a highly-characteristic ‘‘ladder’’ of relaxation inter-

mediates together with a completely relaxed dna band (comigrating with nicked dna) (fig. 2).
in marked contrast to the monocyte enzyme, the topi dna
relaxation activities of all 3 leishmania spp. was significantly
enhanced by magnesium (mg21) ions; the optimal activities observed at 17.5 mm mg21 were 5- to 10-fold higher than activities in the absence of mg21 (data not shown). manganese ions
(mn21) could not effectively substitute for mg21 as cofactor at
any of the concentrations tested (5–15 mm). leishmania donovani topi activity was slightly enhanced by 0.1 mm spermidine (although concentrations of 0.5–5 mm were inhibitory),
and showed a distinct preference for kcl as opposed to nacl
with a concentration optimum of 50 mm. leishmania donovani
topi was optimally active at ph 7.5. the specific activities of
nuclear topi in 3-day leishmania promastigotes were 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than in monocytes (72 6 7.11 3 103
u mg protein21, n 5 6), with relative activities in the order: l.
donovani (2.73 6 0.15 3 103 u mg protein21, n 5 16) . l.
panamensis (0.97 6 0.15 3 103 u mg protein21, n 5 5) . l.
braziliensis (0.7 6 0.08 3 103 u mg protein21, n 5 5). high
levels of atp-dependent topii dna-decatenating activity
(24.14 6 0.76 3 103 u mg protein21, n 5 5) were also found
in monocyte nuclear extracts but could not be detected in promastigotes under the extraction and assay conditions used. similarly, no atp-dependent topii dna relaxation activity could
be identified in parasite nuclear extracts. subcellular fractionation studies confirmed the predominantly nuclear localization
of monocyte tops i and ii and l. donovani topi, with 65–
80% of total cellular enzyme activities recovered in this fraction. the residual tops i and ii activities (20–35%) detected
in postnuclear supernatant fractions potentially reflect the existence of mitochondrial–kinetoplast top isoforms (burri et al.,
1996). analysis of the topi-activity profile during l. donovani
promastigote development in culture revealed that enzyme activity increases during the growth phase reaching a peak in
exponential phase at 3 days and subsequently declines when
the parasite enters stationary phase at day 6 (fig. 3).
inhibition of leishmania donovani and monocyte nuclear
topi activity
the amount of l. donovani topi dna-relaxing activity (1.6
u) used for ic50 assays was slightly lower than that for the

1158

tartrate was found to weakly inhibit l. donovani topi (table
i), but the ic50 value appears too high for physiological significance. none of the latter antimonials has been tested previously against tops.

corresponding monocyte enzyme (2 u) because of the dnanicking activity of the parasite enzyme. the bis-benzimidazoles
 xxxd2284xxx  and hoechst 33342 were highly potent inhibitors of both monocyte and l. donovani topi dna-relaxing
activities (table i). interestingly, l. donovani topi was considerably less sensitive than the monocyte enzyme to inhibition
by the specific poison  xxxd412xxx , with a statistically significant 16-fold difference (p , 0.05) between ic50 values (table
i). ssg was a highly effective inhibitor of both l. donovani
and monocyte topi, and showed a significant (p , 0.05) 3.4fold greater potency against the parasite enzyme (fig. 4; table
i). the antimonials meglumine antimoniate and trivalent sodium antimonyl gluconate were poor inhibitors of both parasite
and monocyte topi, with no effect on dna relaxation activity
even at very high concentrations (table i). potassium antimony

the inhibition profile of 10 u of monocyte topi was qualitatively similar to that of 2 u (tables i, ii). the identical ic50
values obtained for the bis-benzimidazoles  xxxd1891xxx  u and 2 u of
monocyte topi activity reveal that inhibition was not relieved
by increasing enzyme concentration, an observation consistent
with the known dna-binding mode of action of these drugs.
in contrast,  xxxd412xxx  exhibited a 3-fold decrease in inhibitory potency against 10 u as compared with 2 u of monocyte
topi (tables i, ii). this intermediate level of inhibition relief
appears to reflect the known mechanism of  xxxd412xxx  binding to the topi dna–cleavable complex rather than to enzyme
or substrate alone. comparison of the effects of ssg upon 2 u
and 10 u of topi using inhibitor ranges containing points of
equimolarity with enzyme concentration (8–205 mm and 20–
1,600 mm ssg, respectively) revealed a 9-fold decrease in potency with increasing enzyme (tables i, ii). this indicates that
ssg binds directly to the topi enzyme rather than to the dna
substrate or cleavable complex. monocyte topii kdna decatenating activity (10 u) exhibited high sensitivity to inhibition
by the bis-benzimidazoles but was refractory to inhibition by
the topi poison  xxxd412xxx  and all antimonial drugs (table
ii).
relationship between topi inhibition and drug
cytotoxicities
with the exception of hoechst 33342, qualitatively similiar
cytotoxicity profiles were observed for monocytes and l. donovani promastigotes with relative drug potencies in the order:
 xxxd412xxx  . potassium antimony tartrate k ssg . meglumine antimoniate (table iii). despite high potency as an inhibitor of l. donovani topi, hoechst 33342 exhibited low efficacy against promastigotes in vitro when compared with
monocytes. the 240-fold lower cytotoxicity of  xxxd412xxx 
against l. donovani promastigotes as compared with monocytes
(table iii) reflects the differential specificities of this drug for

nicked (n) dnas are indicated.

parasite and host topi (table i). the in vitro cytotoxicities of
ssg and potassium antimony tartrate showed an inverse relationship to their inhibitory effects on parasite and host topi
activities, whereas meglumine antimoniate exhibited consistently low inhibitory potency both at cellular and enzyme levels
(tables i, iii). standardization experiments involving microscopical evaluation of drug cytotoxicities gave ed50 values in
close agreement with phosphatase assay data, precluding the
possibility that test inhibitors acted directly upon the phosphatase viability marker.
discussion
the insensitivity of l. donovani topi to inhibition by sbiii
negates the possibility that selective targeting of this enzyme in
leishmania spp. is responsible for the in vivo cytotoxicity of
the presumed active form of antimonial drugs. nonetheless, we
have confirmed the high potency of the sbv drug ssg as an
inhibitor of l. donovani and, to a significantly lesser extent,
monocyte topi. the failure of another sbv drug, meglumine
antimoniate, to inhibit parasite or host topi indicates that the
active component of ssg may be independent of antimony. the
study also reveals significant differences between the sensitivities of human and parasite enzymes and cells to classical top
inhibitors, which may be exploitable for rational drug design.
basic characterization of nuclear topi activity in l. donovani confirmed cofactor requirements and subcellular localiza-

tion and identified peak enzyme activity in exponential phase
promastigotes, thus corroborating previous northern analyses
of topi gene expression in these parasites (broccoli et al.,
1999). the inherent nicking activity exhibited by l. donovani
topi has been demonstrated previously in dna relaxation assays of the purified enzyme (ray et al., 1998). topi generates
low levels of nicked dna as part of normal catalysis, but the
significance of the enhanced nicking activity of the uninhibited
l. donovani enzyme is unclear.
model bis-benzimidazoles proved equally potent inhibitors of
both l. donovani and monocyte topi with ic50 values in the
range reported previously for the enzymes of calf thymus and
the fungus pneumocystis carinii (dykstra et al., 1994). these
compounds act principally as suppressors by binding to the
dna minor groove and causing structural changes that interfere
with top binding and catalysis. the unexpectedly low cytotoxicity of hoechst 33342 to l. donovani promastigotes in vitro
contrasts markedly with the high sensitivity of monocytes.
hoechst 33342 was recently reported as cytotoxic to promastigotes of l. donovani (strain 1s2d), l. major, and l. mexicana
(but not l. braziliensis) with maximal growth inhibition observed after incubation  xxxd1891xxx –25 mm of drug for 4–6 days,
whereas  xxxd2284xxx  was completely ineffective against all
species tested because of reduced membrane permeability (marquis, drolet et al., 2003). the differential cytotoxicities of

leishmania spp. and monocytes may reflect similar variations
with respect to mechanisms of bis-benzimidazole uptake. several novel derivatives of bis-benzimidazoles have been identified as selective inhibitors of tops from the parasitic protozoan
giardia lamblia and p. carinii (bell et al., 1993; dykstra et al.,
1994), thus providing a precedent for the generation of parasitespecific agents through modification of existing compounds.
the classical topi poison  xxxd412xxx  acts by stabilizing
the enzyme–substrate reaction intermediate (cleavable complex), thus inducing top-mediated dna cleavage and replication arrest.  xxxd412xxx  has been shown to cause cytotoxicity through cleavable-complex formation in leishmania spp.
parasites in vitro with ed50 values similar to our current data
(bodley and shapiro, 1995; bodley et al., 1995), but the drugs’
effects on parasite topi dna relaxation activities have not
been studied previously. the present data reveal that l. donovani promastigotes are less sensitive than monocytes to  xxxd412xxx  poisoning both at the level of topi activity and intact
cells, thus corroborating previous reports of the drugs’ low inhibitory potency against topi of p. carinii (ic50 5 .100 mm)
and plasmodium falciparum (ic50 5 .500 mm) (dykstra et al.,
1994; tosh et al., 1999). furthermore, p. carinii topi is also
refractory to inhibition by the potent mammalian topi poisons
nitidine, distamycin a, and coralyne, yet highly sensitive to
nogalamycin (van dross and sanders, 2002). a recent study
has demonstrated that coralyne and certain related protoberberine-alkaloid derivatives show selective activity against l. donovani promastigotes and amastigotes in vitro with minimal toxicity to host macrophages (marquis, markhey et al., 2003). the
differential specificities of classical poisons for topi enzymes
of lower eukaryotes and mammals indicate structural or catalytic variations that may provide opportunities for selective inhibitor development.
ssg was a potent inhibitor of both l. donovani and human
monocyte topi dna relaxation activity, but none of the other
sbv- or sbiii-containing drugs had any significant inhibitory effects upon parasite or host enzymes. the relative ed50 values
of the antimonial drugs agree well with previous ranges of data
reported for leishmania spp. and confirm the well-documented
sensitivity of promastigotes to sbiii but not sbv (roberts et al.,
1995; ephros et al., 1999). the observed disparity between the
high leishmanicidal activities and low anti-topi potencies of
sbiii-containing drugs indicates that leishmania spp. topi is
unlikely to be specifically targeted by antimonials through the
hypothetical sbv to sbiii activation pathway in vivo. however,

the reported in vitro induction of cleavable-complex formation
in l. panamensis promastigotes by ssg (lucumi et al., 1998)
may have occurred through interaction with topii. the low
ic50 of ssg for l. donovani topi is consistent with a previous
estimate (100% inhibition of purified l. donovani topi [2 u]
at 16 mm of sbv), but human monocyte topi is markedly more
sensitive to ssg than the calf thymus enzyme (0% inhibition
at 400 mm of sbv) (chakraborty and majumder, 1988). ssg is
a heterogeneous formulation comprising different sbv–gluconic
acid conjugates. antimony is known to form covalent bonds
with protein sulphydryl (-sh) groups (berman and grogl,
1988), but the inhibitory activity of ssg against topi appears
to be attributable to a chemical component other than sbv because neither meglumine antimoniate nor sbiii drugs were inhibitory. our use of additive-free sbv formulations precludes
the possibility of interference by components such as the preservative m-chlorocresol (roberts and rainey, 1993). the
chemical basis for the high anti-topi potency of ssg remains
to be elucidated, although as indicated both in this study and
previously (chakraborty and majumder, 1988), the mechanism
seems to involve direct binding to the enzyme. ssg was recently identified as a potent inhibitor of mammalian protein
tyrosine phosphatases (ptpases) (pathak and yi, 2001) and, in
a striking parallel with the present results for topi, the ptpases
were completely uninhibited by sbiii at concentrations up to
3,000 mm. similarly, the mode of ssg action involved direct
binding to the catalytic domain, and analysis of drug fractions
revealed that most inhibitory activity resides in a few specific
components and is not solely associated with sbv (pathak and
yi, 2001; yi et al., 2002). ssg-mediated ptpase inhibition results in the augmentation of cellular cytokine signaling and responses (pathak and yi, 2001) and could contribute to macrophage activation as part of the overall activity of ssg against
intracellular leishmania spp. parasites (pathak and yi, 2001;
yi et al., 2002). collectively, the ptpase and topi data emphasize that ssg has a potential multiplicity of undiscovered
pharmacological effects.
because l. donovani promastigotes were insensitive to ssg
with ed50 values of 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than reported for intracellular or axenic amastigotes (roberts et al.,
1995; ephros et al., 1999), it is improbable that the drug is able
to target topi directly in the extracellular life stage. nevertheless, the ic50 of ssg for l. donovani topi is similar to the
concentration normally present in patient sera after treatment
(13 mm sbv) (berman and wyler, 1980), and host macrophages

walker and saravia—inhibition of leishmania topoisomerase i by antimonials

and particularly leishmania intracellular amastigotes accumulate ssg during incubation in vitro resulting in reported intracellular antimony concentrations equivalent to 262 and 566 mm
sb, respectively (roberts et al., 1995). the topi activity of
amastigotes has not been characterized and whereas leishmania
spp. harbor a single copy gene encoding each of the topia
and b subunits (villa et al., 2003), the generation of stagespecific isoenzymes through differential posttranslational processing is possible. consequently, characterization of the enzymatic and cytotoxic effects of ssg and other anti-topi
agents in amastigotes is an essential next step in the evaluation
of leishmania spp. tops as drug targets.
studies of this kind contribute to the understanding of the
pharmacological effects of antimonial drugs in both leishmania
spp. and human host cells. although leishmania topi does not
appear to be a physiologically significant target for selective
inhibition by antimonial drugs per se, the enzyme is uniquely
sensitive to direct inhibition by ssg. the precise inhibition
mechanism remains to be determined, and identification of the
active components of ssg coupled with the development of
analogues with greater specificity for parasite topi is merited.
similarly, the differential interaction of leishmania spp. and
host topi with  xxxd412xxx  provides a basis for development
of parasite-specific agents. the application of specific tops i
and ii activity assays provides a valuable tool for the continued
inhibitor screening of leishmania spp. and human enzymes.
