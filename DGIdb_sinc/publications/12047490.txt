aims to compare the effects of  xxxd2688xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx , two cyclo-oxygenase-2
(cox-2) preferential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), on platelet
cox-1 activity and platelet function.
methods twelve healthy volunteers (3 male, 9 female, median age 22 years)
participated in an open, randomized, cross-over trial of  xxxd2688xxx  1000 mg twice
daily vs  xxxd2561xxx  7.5 mg twice daily during 1 week with 2 weeks wash-out. after
a second 2 week wash-out period, one dose of indomethacin 50 mg was given as a
positive control to check for nsaid induced inhibition of platelet function. cox-1
inhibition was measured as percentage inhibition of serum txb2 generation in
clotting whole blood, and as closure time with use of the platelet function analyser
pfa-100. data are reported as median with range. paired variables were analysed using
wilcoxons signed rank test.
results txb2 levels decreased significantly after all three medications, but percentage
inhibition after  xxxd2688xxx  and indomethacin (88% and 97%, respectively) was
significantly higher than after  xxxd2561xxx  (63%) (p<0.05). closure times increased
significantly after administration of all three medications (p<0.05). increases in
closure time after administration did not differ between  xxxd2688xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx 
(24% and 14%, respectively), but were significantly larger after indomethacin
administration (63%) (p<0.01).
conclusions in the maximum registered dosage,  xxxd2688xxx  inhibits thromboxane
production much more than  xxxd2561xxx , signifying less cox-2 selectivity of the
former. however, both  xxxd2688xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  cause only minor impairment in
platelet function in comparison with indomethacin and the difference between them
is not significant.

introduction
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) demonstrate both pain and inflammation inhibiting properties
as well as several adverse effects such as inhibition of
platelet function, gastro-intestinal damage and renal
impairment. whereas the therapeutic anti-inflammatory
effects are mainly caused by inhibition of the iso-enzyme

cyclo-oxygenase-2 (cox-2), the side-effects mentioned
above are believed to result from inhibition of the isoenzyme cox-1. therefore, it has been suggested that
cox-2 selective nsaids would cause less side-effects
compared with nonselective nsaids [1]. in the netherlands, two available nsaids are considered cox-2
preferential, i.e.  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2688xxx . this
implies, that these nsaids are more selective to
cox-2 than other older generation nsaids, but to a
much lesser degree than newer cox-2 selective agents
such as celecoxib and rofecoxib. nevertheless, it has been
suggested that cox-2 preferential nsaids such as
 xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2688xxx  display decreased toxicity
compared with nonselective nsaids [2].

short report

in the present study, we describe a direct comparison
of the cox-1 effects of two cox-2 preferential
nsaids,  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2688xxx  in healthy volunteers. the production of thromboxane b2 (txb2), the
stable metabolite of thromboxane a2, during whole
blood clotting is used as an index of platelet cox-1
activity ex vivo [3]. cox-1 effects are highly dependent
on the experimental model applied. in our opinion,
the information most relevant for clinical practice is the
degree of cox-1 inhibition that can be obtained during
administration of the maximum registered dosage of a
certain selective nsaid. therefore, we investigated the
effects of  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2688xxx  when used in
daily doses of 15 mg and 2000 mg, respectively. we
compared both medications with indomethacin, which
is a preferential cox-1 inhibitor. measurement of
serum txb2 production does not necessarily reflect the
degree of impairment of platelet function [4]. therefore,
we also measured impairment of platelet function
following  xxxd2688xxx  and  xxxd2561xxx  with the platelet
function analyser (pfa-100).

methods
twelve healthy nonsmoking caucasian volunteers (3 men,
9 women, median age 22 years, range 20–37 years) entered
the study. all subjects gave written informed consent
before participating in the study. the study was approved
by the ethics committee of the canisius-wilhelmina
hospital, nijmegen, the netherlands. all study participants refrained from smoking and alcohol for at least 1
week before enrolment and during the entire study.
none of the subjects was using concomitant medications
during the study. the study was designed as an
open, two-armed, randomized crossover trial. volunteers
were randomly assigned to either  xxxd2561xxx  7.5 mg
(movicox1, boehringer ingelheim bv, alkmaar, the
netherlands) or  xxxd2688xxx  1000 mg (mebutan1,
smithkline beecham farma, rijswijk, the netherlands),
both twice daily at 08.00 h and 18.00 h after a meal, both
for a period of 7 days. after a washout period of 14 days,
the volunteers used the alternative regimen. after a
second washout period of 14 days, a control experiment
was performed, in which subjects were given one dose
of 50 mg indomethacin (indocid1, merck sharp and
dohme, haarlem, the netherlands).
all blood samples were obtained after a resting period
of 10 min. baseline venous blood samples were taken
on day 0 and after each washout period. profile venous
blood samples were obtained 2 h after the last  xxxd2561xxx 
and last  xxxd2688xxx  doses, and also 2 h after the single
indomethacin dose. every blood sample was drawn with
use of vacutainer tubes (becton dickenson bv, leiden,
the netherlands) and a 21-gauge cannula inserted into the
f 2002 blackwell science ltd br j clin pharmacol, 53, 644–647

antecubital vein of each subject. the compression
band was released after insertion, and the first 3 ml
blood obtained were not used for measurement. in
each blood sample, we measured serum txb2 levels and
ex vivo bleeding time. txb2 concentrations in serum were
determined by enzymimmuno-assay (cayman chemical
company, ann arbor, usa) [5]. samples were obtained
in 10 ml nonsiliconized vacutainer dry tubes and
immediately incubated at 37u c to stimulate platelet
thromboxane production during coagulation. after 1 h,
blood samples were centrifuged at 4200 g for 10 min at
4u c. specimens were subsequently stored at x70u c
until assayed according to the manufacturers procedures.
ex vivo bleeding time was determined with use of
the pfa-100 (platelet function analyser, dade nv,
amersfoort, the netherlands). this instrument has been
designed as an alternative for the bleeding time test
because the bleeding time is inherently variable, time
consuming and patient unfriendly [6]. the pfa-100
aspirates a blood sample under constant vacuum from a
sample reservoir through a capillary and a microscopic
aperture cut into a membrane, coated with collagen and
 xxxd2007xxx . this biochemical stimulus together with a
high shear rate generates platelet adhesion, activation,
and aggregation under standardized flow conditions,
slowly building up a stable platelet plug closing the
aperture. the time required to obtain full occlusion of
the aperture is reported as ex vivo bleeding time or
‘closure time’. for this test, blood was collected in
vacutainer tubes containing 0.35 ml of 0.129 mol lx1
(3.8%) buffered sodium citrate, ph 5.2, with a draw
volume of 3.15 ml. we used a citrate concentration of
0.129 mol lx1 (3.8%) because a previous study demonstrated a clearly enhanced sensitivity of paf-100 testing
for  xxxd234xxx  induced platelet dysfunction
when blood samples were collected with 0.129 mol lx1
rather than 0.106 mol lx1 sodium citrate [7]. all tests
were performed at room temperature within 1 h. results
were expressed in seconds with a maximum measurable
value of 300 s.
data are reported as median with range. the data
were combined regardless of the treatment sequence,
comparing post-treatment with pretreatment measurements. analysis of paired variables was performed with
wilcoxons signed rank test. a p value <0.05 was
considered significant. all statistical computations were
performed using the spss statistical package (spss 9.0,
chicago, illinois, usa).

results
all volunteers completed the study. five subjects
experienced mild nausea, all after taking  xxxd2688xxx ,

serum thromboxane b2 concentration

discussion

baseline txb2 concentrations before  xxxd2688xxx 
(628 nmol lx1,
range
85–1361),
 xxxd2561xxx 
(769 nmol lx1, range 184–1163), and indomethacin
(634 nmol lx1, range 99–953) did not differ significantly.
txb2 concentrations decreased significantly after all
three medications. percentage inhibition of txb2 concentrations after  xxxd2688xxx  (88%) and indomethacin
(97%) was significantly higher than inhibition after
 xxxd2561xxx  (63%) (p<0.05) (figure 1).

in the present study, we found that  xxxd2561xxx  7.5 mg
twice daily causes significantly less decrease in txb2
synthesis (66%) than  xxxd2688xxx  1000 mg twice daily
(88%). however, both medications caused only minor
increases in closure time compared with indomethacin.
the reductions of serum txb2 production after  xxxd2561xxx  and  xxxd2688xxx  were compatible with reductions
previously reported [8–10], as was the 97% reduction of
serum txb2 after indomethacin [8].
as in an earlier study with  xxxd2561xxx  [8], one of
the volunteers showed a normal closure time (133 s)
despite a nearly complete suppression of the txb2
production (6 nmol lx1). in the same volunteer, the
closure times also remained within normal ranges
following  xxxd2688xxx  (118 s) although the txb2 level
(9 nmol lx1) demonstrated clear inhibition. this suggests
the presence of resistance to impairment of platelet
function by nsaids despite adequate suppression of
the txb2 level. others have also reported a normal
closure time after aspirin treatment in a volunteer [6].
therefore, our data clearly confirm that platelet function following nsaids cannot be regarded as an
absolute reliable indicator of nsaid induced platelet
cyclo-oxygenase inhibition.

closure time, pfa-100 method
the mean baseline closure time measurements before
 xxxd2688xxx  (123 s, range 78–185),  xxxd2561xxx  (119 s,
range 86–183), and indomethacin (131 s, range 69–191)
were not significantly different. after a single indomethacin dose, closure time increased significantly by
63%, and was prolonged to 300 s in 6 of 12 patients
(p<0.01). after treatment with  xxxd2688xxx  and
 xxxd2561xxx , closure time increased by 24% and 14%,
respectively (p<0.05). however, these increases were
significantly smaller than the increase in closure time
after indomethacin (p<0.01). there was no significant

short report

even a 88% inhibition of txb2 production by
 xxxd2688xxx  did not result in a clear impairment of
platelet function in this study. this may be explained
by the findings of reilly & fitzgerald, who showed
that significant reduction of urinary excretion of txb2
metabolites will not be achieved before a maximum
ex vivo inhibition of thromboxane production (i.e. serum
txb2 concentrations) by more than 95% [4]. this
means that physiological thromboxane concentrations
in vivo are much less susceptible to inhibition of platelet
cyclo-oxygenase than the nonphysiological maximum
thromboxane production in clotting blood ex vivo.
our study has several important limitations. we
investigated platelet function in a small group of healthy
volunteers, whereas the clinical relevance of cox-2
selectivity lies mainly in the prevalence of renal and
gastrointestinal side-effects. however, previous studies
have shown a clear correlation between the relative
potency of nsaids against cox-1 and adverse gastrointestinal effects and cox-2 specific inhibitors have
demonstrated significantly less adverse effects compared
to nonselective nsaids [11, 12]. the present study
demonstrates that platelet cox-1 is inhibited much
more following the maximum dose of  xxxd2688xxx  than
following the maximum dose of  xxxd2561xxx . this may
suggest that  xxxd2688xxx  in antirheumatic dosage will
cause more side-effects related to cox-1 suppression
than  xxxd2561xxx . we further found, that the higher
cox-2 selectivity of  xxxd2561xxx  compared with  xxxd2688xxx  is not influencing impairment of platelet function.
nevertheless, future studies should investigate, whether
the same is true for the risk of gastro-intestinal and renal
impairment, which is the most important side-effect
of nsaids.
finally, the nonselective nsaids ibuprofen and indomethacin may interfere with the inhibition of txb2
production by  xxxd234xxx  [13, 14]. this interaction
does not occur between aspirin and the cox-2 selective
nsaid rofecoxib [15]. further investigations need to be
performed into the degree of cox-2 selectivity that is
necessary to avoid pharmacological interaction between
nsaids and  xxxd234xxx . cox-2 selective nsaids
might increase the risk of thrombotic complications by
inhibiting the production of the antithrombotic prostaglandin pgi2 (a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of
platelet aggregation) but not the production of the prothrombotic txa2, a potent activator of platelet aggregation [16]. in the present study,  xxxd2561xxx  and especially
 xxxd2688xxx  inhibited the production of txb2 substantially. however, this did not cause major inhibition of
platelet function. this raises the suspicion that these
cox-2 preferential nsaids may also increase the risk
of thrombotic complications similar to cox-2 selective

f 2002 blackwell science ltd br j clin pharmacol, 53, 644–647

nsaids, and future clinical studies should focus on the
occurrence of such thrombotic complications in patients
using these medications.
