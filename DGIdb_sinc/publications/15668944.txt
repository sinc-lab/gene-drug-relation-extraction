the role of eicosanoids in atherogenesis has not been thouroughly explained. this is partly due to the numerous eicosanoids and the
variable effects that each has on different systems. apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells has been shown to play a role in
the atherosclerotic disease leading to lesion formation and further destabilization of the formed lesion. in this study, we have
investigated the role of  xxxd208xxx  derived eicosanoids in  xxxd2738xxx  (no)-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells. we have
shown previously that the  xxxd2738xxx  (no)-induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells was accompanied by arachidonic
acid release via cytoplasmic  xxxg1759xxx  ( xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx ) activation. also,  xxxd208xxx , but not  xxxd2777xxx , induced apoptosis of
these cells at low concentrations (5–10 mm). our results revealed that the  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  specific inhibitor, arachidonyl trifluoromethyl
ketone (aacocf3), blocked no-induced eicosanoid production, while the presence of  xxxd208xxx  enhanced the ability of
the cells to make  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2). also, inhibitors of the cyclo-oxygenase (cox) enzymes, such as n-[2-cyclohexyloxy)4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide (ns-398), a specific  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor, or indomethacin, a non-specific cox inhibitor, blocked
no-induced pge2 production and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells to the same extent, indicating that apoptosis might be
induced by a  xxxg1884xxx  metabolic product. in addition to these observations, the eicosanoids investigated, namely, pge2, pgi2 ltb4,
and pgj2, showed different effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. both pgj2 and ltb4 decreased the percentage of viable cells and
induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, while pge2 and pgi2 had no effect on cell viability and failed to induce
apoptosis. these data suggest that eicosanoids, such as pgj2, but not pge2 or pgi2, are involved in no-induced apoptosis
of vascular smooth muscle cells and that the eicosanoid synthesis pathways might be utilized for vascular therapeutic strategies. j.

smooth muscle cells constitute up to 60–80% of the
cellular population within the arterial intima in atherosclerotic plaques and restenotic lesions. of these, a
proportion of the intimal smooth muscle cells are composed of cells recently migrated from the media, while
the rest are generated from proliferation of migrated
smooth muscle cells. in advanced atherosclerotic plaques, apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells is
observed (geng and libby, 2002). the apoptosis of
vascular smooth muscle cells has recently drawn a lot of
interest due to its importance during atherogenesis. we
have shown previously that the  xxxd2738xxx  (no)
induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells was
accompanied by the release of  xxxd208xxx  (pilane
and labelle, 2002, 2004).  xxxd208xxx  has been well
established as a precursor for eicosanoid production
(tsujii and dubois, 1995; prescott and white, 1996). the
cyclo-oxygenase (cox) enzymes, cox-1 and  xxxg1884xxx , make
eicosanoids from  xxxd208xxx . among the eicosanoids made by cox enzymes, pge2 is the best-known
and most stable form. pge2 can induce or suppress
apoptosis in a variety of cells, depending on the
concentrations and the cell type studied (suzuki et al.,
1991; pica et al., 1996; sheng et al., 1998; porter and
malek, 1999). for example, increases in pge2 decrease
apoptosis in colonic cancer cells (sheng et al., 1998) but
increase apoptosis in resting t-cells (porter and malek,
1999). in contrast to resting t-cells, activated t-cells
treated with pge2 decrease fas-mediated apoptosis by
controlling the expression of  xxxd3135xxx . the expression
of  xxxd3135xxx  was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner
by pge2. at a concentration of 10 nm, pge2 induced the
expression of  xxxd3135xxx , while at 100-nm pge2, fasligand was not detected (porter and malek, 1999).

compared to pge2, pgj2 consistently induces apoptosis. addition of exogenous pgj2 to a variety of cells
induced morphological changes that led to dna fragmentation. pgj2 mediates caspase-induced apoptosis
through its ability to control caspase activation. when
caspase enzymes are activated, they cleave protein
substrates such as poly-adp ribose polymerase (parp),
involved in dna repair. the addition of 10 mm pgj2 to
jeg-3 choriocarcinoma cells induced the cleavage of an
83-kb fragment form of parp. 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 is a
downstream metabolite of  xxxg1073xxx , and is produced by
degradation of  xxxg1073xxx . 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2-associated
apoptosis has been linked to the peroxisome proliferator
activator receptor,  xxxg1807xxx  (keelan et al., 1999).  xxxg1807xxx 
belongs to a group of nuclear receptors that influence
cellular processes such as apoptosis through its formation of heterodimers with the retinoid receptor (rxr).
15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 is one of several potent  xxxg1807xxx

ligands. northern blot analysis proved that  xxxg1807xxx  was
present in the jeg-3 cells induced to undergo apoptosis
by 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2 (keelan et al., 1999). 15-deoxyd12,14-pgj2 activates map-kinases (p38, jnk, erk) in
a dose- and time-dependent fashion in pancreatic cancer
cells (hashimoto et al., 2004). sb202190, an inhibitor of
p38, prevented 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2-induced activation of  xxxg342xxx , -9, and -3 and significantly decreased
apoptosis. this effect was potentiated by  xxxd3231xxx , an
inhibitor of jnk, although  xxxd3231xxx  alone had no
significant effect on 15-deoxy-d12,14-pgj2-induced
apoptosis. in contrast,  xxxd1169xxx , an inhibitor of mek,
significantly increased sensitivity to 15-deoxy-d12,14pgj2-induced apoptosis. this indicated that 15-deoxyd12,14-pgj2 stimulated both proapoptotic and antiapoptotic mapk pathways (hashimoto et al., 2004).
another form of eicosanoid, leukotriene, has been
shown to play a role in apoptosis (ghosh and myers,
1998; park et al., 2004). most of the work investigating
the effects of leukotrienes on apoptosis has included the
use of various inhibitors. two commonly used leukotriene
synthesis inhibitors include 3-[3-tert-butylsulfanyl- 1-(4chlorobenzyl)-5-isopropyl-1h-indol -2-yl]-2,2-dimethylpropionic acid (mk-886), a  xxxg147xxx  ( xxxg147xxx )
inhibitor, and  xxxd2748xxx  ( xxxd2748xxx ), which
blocks 5- and 12-lox, respectively. treatment of lncap
human prostate cancer cells with mk-886 produced
massive apoptosis within 4 and 8 h of treatment. in
addition, exogenously added 5-hete protected these
cells from mk-886-induced apoptosis (ghosh and myers,
1998). also, treatment of hl-60 cells with  xxxd2748xxx 
produced a concentration-dependent increase in apoptosis (park et al., 2004). korystov et al. (1998) measured the
sensitivity of lympholeukemic p388 cells to inhibitors of
pla2, cox, and lipoxygenase. they determined that the
pla2 inhibitor, 4-bromophenacyl bromide and the
lipoxygenase inhibitor,  xxxd2748xxx  could both stimulate cell
growth at low concentrations while stimulating apoptosis
at higher concentrations. the cox inhibitor indomethacin failed to stimulate either cell growth or apoptosis at
any concentration. this suggested that some lipoxygenase product, such as leukotriene or 5-hete, is necessary
for the growth of p388 cells at low levels but induces
apoptosis at higher levels. therefore, low levels of pla2
or lipoxygenase inhibitors decrease leukotriene or hete
levels from the apoptotic range to the proliferative range.
high levels of pla2 or lipoxygenase inhibitors completely
eliminate leukotrienes or hetes from the cells and that
condition is also apoptotic (korystov et al., 1998).
conversely, addition of 30-mm  xxxd2748xxx  increased cell
survival compared to control cells during  xxxg764xxx  ligand
mediated apoptosis in malignant glioma cells (wagenknecht et al., 1997). since the majority of the published
studies concerning the effects of eicosanoids on cellular
growth and death were somewhat contradictory, we
decided to study the sensitivity of vascular smooth
muscle cells to eicosanoids and to their inhibitors. it
was important to determine if these eicosanoids had any
influence on smooth muscle cellular apoptosis. we have
determined that the prostanoids derived from  xxxd208xxx  can induce apoptosis and decrease the viability of
vascular smooth muscle cells treated with apoptotic
stimuli, such as no. our data reveal that pgj2 and
perhaps ltb4, but not pge2 and pgi2 are involved in
apoptosis of no-stimulated vascular smooth muscle cells.
materials and methods
sodium nitroprusside (np, no-donor), fetal bovine serum
(fbs), essential minimal eagle’s medium (emem), penstrep

(100 u/ml), and bovine  xxxg124xxx  were from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo). the tunel analysis-kit was
from promega (madison, wi). ns-398, indomethacin,  xxxd2748xxx ,
pgj2, pge2, pgi2, and pge2 elisa kit were purchased
from cayman chemical (ann arbor, mi). arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (aacocf3) was from biomol (plymouth
meeting, pa).
methods
cell culture and treatments. the sv-40 transformed
vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) were maintained in
emem supplemented with 100 u/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml
streptomycin, and 10% heat inactivated fbs. these cells were
maintained in a humidified incubator at 378c and 5% co2.
when the cells reached confluency, they were released from the
flasks by treatment with trypsin and split one-third before
allowing further cell growth. the use of sv-40 transformed
cells poses some advantages over the primary cells (reilly,
1990; pilane and labelle, 2002). exponentially growing cells
were treated with no in presence or absence of inhibitors or
with pgj2, pge2, pgi2, or ltb4.
tunel analysis. tunel analysis was performed as was
shown by pilane and labelle (2002). briefly, the cells were
collected in 10 ml of pbs and centrifuged at low speeds
(200 rpm) for 10 min. the supernatant was discarded and the
cells resuspended in 200 ml of pbs. one hundred microliters of
suspended cells were placed on a poly-lysine coated slide and
allowed to air dry (10–15 min) at room temparature. the cells
were then covered with a fixative solution (4% paraformaldehyde). the rest of the assay was carried out as discussed in
pilane and labelle (2002).
cell viability analysis. to assess cell viability, vascular
smooth muscle cells were washed with pbs followed by
trypsinization to efficiently detach cells from the surfaces.
the suspended cells were collected in pbs, washed and
exposed to 300 ml of 0.5% trypan blue stain (0.5% trypan blue
in 0.85% nacl) for every 1 ml of cell suspension. the cells were
mixed thoroughly with trypan blue dye and then loaded into a
hemocytometer and observed under a light microscope. cell
viability was assessed based on the ability of non-viable cells to
accumulate the trypan blue dye and expressed as the percentage of the total number of cells (pilane and labelle, 2004).
pge2 production assay. the pge2 assay was performed
on protein coated 96-well plates according to the manufacturer’s instructions (alexis corp., san diego, ca). briefly, the
cells were lysed in a lysis buffer and an equal amount of protein
was loaded into the 96-well plates for 30 min. the standard
curve was prepared, using known amounts of pge2. the pge2
acetylcholinesterase tracer was added to the lysates followed
by addition of the pge2 monoclonal antibody to immunolocalize pge2. the reaction mixture was allowed to incubate for
18 h at 48c. the plates were then incubated with the ellman’s
developing reagent in the dark, on a shaker for 60–90 min. the
plates were then read on a plate reader at 405 nm. the pge2
content per sample was determined using the standard curve
and expressed as nanogram pge2 produced per microgram of
cell protein.

results

one of the most stable and abundant forms of prostaglandin in vascular tissue is pge2. in these experiments, pge2 production was determined to provide
information concerning cyclo-oxygenase activity. our
data revealed that vascular smooth muscle cells treated
with no made substantial amounts of pge2, as measured by pge2 analysis assay (fig. 1). when the cells
were treated with  xxxd208xxx  (10 mm), we observed
a substantial increase in pge2 production over a period
of 72 h (fig. 2). cells treated with no in the presence of
10 mm  xxxd208xxx  showed an even further increase

and ltb4. pge2 had no effect on cell viability and did
not induce apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells
(fig. 5a,b). however, pgj2 and ltb4, but not pgi2,
decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells in a concentration-dependent
manner (fig. 5a,b).

in pge2 production (fig. 2). no itself induced pge2
production from vascular smooth muscle cells by about
1.4-fold (fig. 1). the  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  inhibitor, aacocf3, at
10 mm, decreased the pge2 stimulation by no to control
values (fig. 2). a non-specific cox inhibitor, indomethacin, inhibited no-induced pge2 production to the same
extent as did ns-398, a  xxxg1884xxx  specific inhibitor (fig. 3).
also, both of these inhibitors, ns-398 and indomethacin,
blocked the no-induced apoptosis of the vascular
smooth muscle cells by 33% (fig. 4). these data demonstrated that a  xxxg1884xxx  product but not a cox-1 product is
most likely involved in no-induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells. in addition to these observations, a lipoxygenase inhibitor,  xxxd2748xxx , had no
significant effect on no-induced apoptosis of vascular
smooth muscle cells (fig. 4).
to further study the effects of eicosanoids on apoptosis
in vascular smooth muscle cells, we treated the cells
with increasing concentrations of pge2, pgi2, pgj2,

therapeutic strategies for atherogenesis that target the eicosanoid synthesis pathway are currently
being explored. recent studies suggest that high-dose
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, in addition to
inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity, exert an antiproliferative effect on vsmc growth both in vitro and in vivo
(brooks et al., 2003). our experiments show that no can
induce eicosanoid production in vascular smooth muscle
cells. such increases in pge2 production indicated that
cox enzymes, cox-1 and  xxxg1884xxx , that convert arachidonic
acid to prostanoids might be active in our cells. we also

pilane and labelle

fig. 5. a: inhibition of cell viability of vascular smooth muscle cells. cells were treated with increasing
logarithmic concentrations of pge2 (*), pgi2 (*), pgj2 (~), or ltb4 (~) for 48 h, and the percentage
viability determined as described in methods. b: apoptosis produced by eicosanoids in vascular smooth
muscle cells. cells were treated with increasing logarithmic concentrations of pge2 (*), pgi2 (*), pgj2

observed that cells exposed to exogenously added  xxxd208xxx  produced more pge2. this was consistent
with cox activity in the cells.
we reported earlier that aacocf3 could inhibit
 xxxd208xxx  release from these cells and this same
inhibitor blocked pge2 production (pilane and labelle,
2002). it appeared likely that  xxxg1884xxx  was required for
pge2 production by these cells since the  xxxg1884xxx  specific
inhibitor, ns-398, could block no-induced pge2 production. moreover, inhibition of prostaglandin production by a  xxxg1884xxx  inhibitor, ns-398, reduced no induced
apoptosis by 30% after 48 h, while the  xxxg1228xxx   xxxg1763xxx  inhibitor,
aacocf3, blocked no-induced apoptosis by 80% after
48 h (pilane and labelle, 2002). these data indicate that
some percentage (about 40%) of cell death is possibly due
to some product of  xxxg1884xxx .
indomethacin, a non-specific cox inhibitor, also
inhibited 30% of no-induced apoptosis indicating that
a  xxxg1884xxx  product was involved in the induction of apoptosis by prostanoids. a lipoxygenase inhibitor,  xxxd2748xxx ,
did not significantly decrease no-induced apoptosis,
showing that this pathway was not significantly involved in no-induced apoptosis. while pge2 and pgi2
had no effect on cell viability and apoptosis of vascular
smooth muscle cells, other  xxxd208xxx  metabolites,
pgj2, and ltb4 had variable effects. pgj2 and ltb4
seemed to be capable of inducing a decrease in cell
viability. the cell apoptosis data show that pgj2 and
ltb4 induced apoptosis after 48 h while both pge2 and
pgi2 had no effect. also a lipoxygenase inhibitor,
 xxxd2748xxx , did not block the no-induced apoptosis. however, ltb4 did induce some apoptosis, indicating possibly that  xxxd2748xxx  was not effective in blocking production of
ltb4 in our cells or that pgj2 had a more pronounced
role in apoptosis in these cells than did ltb4.
apoptosis induced by pgj2 is consistent with the
sensitivity of the cells to ns-398, which suggests a  xxxg1884xxx 
requirement. apoptosis induced by ltb4 is not consistent with the insensitivity of apoptosis to the lipoxygenase inhibitor,  xxxd2748xxx . the difference in action among
these eicosanoids is that ltb4 and pgj2 mediate their
effect via peroxisome proliferator activator receptors
(ppars), which belong to a family of receptors for ligand

activated transcription factors that include steroids,
retinoids, and thyroid hormones. to date, three have
been observed, namely, the -a, -b, and -g. ltb4 acts via
 xxxg1805xxx  (devchand et al., 1996) while pgj2 acts via
 xxxg1807xxx .
ltb4 is not stable, and it is metabolized into 20-ohltb4 or 20-cooh-ltb4 that are less potent that ltb4
itself (devchand et al., 1996). this fact might explain the
insignificant induction of apoptosis by ltb4. primary
aortal cells express substantial amounts of  xxxg1805xxx ,
which acts by downregulation of cytokine-induced genes
(delerive et al., 1999). it antagonizes nuclear  xxxg1559xxx 
genes and induces mrna for ikb.  xxxg1805xxx  deficient mice
show a prolonged inflammatory response following
treatment with ltb4 (delirive et al., 2001). the
treatment of coronary disease patients with fibrates,
which act via  xxxg1805xxx , results in a reduction in the
plasma levels of interleukin-6,  xxxg520xxx , and
fibrinogen (staels et al., 1998).
similarly, pgj2 can be converted to d12-pgj2 or 15deoxy-d pgj2 (forman et al., 1995). all these pgj2’s
targets  xxxg1807xxx  for their action and serve a similar
function, except 15-deoxy-pgj2 induces its effects much
earlier (2 h) than does pgj2 or d12-pgj2 (4 h) (forman
et al., 1995). pgj2 is anti-inflammatory and blocks
cytokine-induced activation of  xxxg1559xxx  thereby blocking
the expression of inflammatory agents. pge2 and pgi2
function via activation of g-protein-linked receptors and
both of these eicosanoids appear not to be involved in
apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells.
we have shown in this study that eicosanoids are
involved in the apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle
cells. pgj2 and ltb4, but not pgi2 and pge2, induced
apoptosis and decreased the viability of vascular smooth
muscle cells. these data suggest that eicosanoid production could be targeted in the treatment of the
vascular diseases that involves vascular cell death.
