the actin cytoskeleton plays a significant role in changes of cell shape and motility, and interactions between the actin filaments and the cell membrane are crucial for a variety of cellular
processes. several adaptor proteins, including talin, maintain the cytoskeleton-membrane linkage
by binding to integral membrane proteins and to the cytoskeleton.  xxxg1304xxx , a recently characterized transmembrane protein with homology to c-type lectins, is a membrane-binding site for talin
in peripheral ruffles of spreading cells. to facilitate studies of  xxxg1304xxx ’s function, we have generated
a  xxxg1304xxx -fc fusion protein comprising the extracellular part of  xxxg1304xxx  joined to  xxxd2207xxx  heavy chain and used this chimera to identify  xxxg1304xxx  ligands. here, we demonstrate
that  xxxg1304xxx -fc fusion protein binds to hyaluronan immobilized to sepharose. microtiter platebinding assays, coprecipitation experiments, and staining of sections predigested with different
glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes and cell adhesion assays all revealed that  xxxg1304xxx  binds
specifically to hyaluronan but not to other tested glycosaminoglycans.  xxxg1304xxx ’s ability to bind
hyaluronan, a ubiquitous extracellular matrix component, reveals an interesting parallel between
 xxxg1304xxx  and cd44, because both can bind to cytoskeleton-membrane linker proteins through their
cytoplasmic domains and to hyaluronan through their extracellular domains. this parallelism
suggests a role for  xxxg1304xxx  in cell adhesion and motility.

introduction
cell shape and movement form the basis for several biological phenomena such as morphogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. the actin cytoskeleton is a major determinant of
changes in cell shape, and interactions between actin filaments and the cell membrane are essential for cell adhesion,
spreading, and migration, as well as for signal transduction
(hall, 1998; schoenwaelder and burridge, 1999). several
molecules have been recognized as linkers between the actin

cytoskeleton and the cell membrane. for example, members
of the band 4.1/erm superfamily (band 4.1, talin, ezrin,
radixin, moesin, and merlin, the product of the neurofibromatosis type 2 tumor suppressor gene) are characterized by
the presence of a conserved n-terminal membrane-binding
domain, which is able to bind to the cytoplasmic region of
several transmembrane receptors, including cd44, cd43,
icam-2, and  xxxg1128xxx  (sainio et al., 1997; heiska et al., 1998;
yonemura et al., 1998). the c-terminal regions of erm proteins are thought to bind to actin filaments, thereby linking
these transmembrane receptors to the cytoskeleton (reviewed by mangeat et al., 1999).
 xxxg1304xxx  is a recently cloned ⬃55-kda membrane-binding
partner for talin (borowsky and hynes, 1998) that is widely
expressed in different cell types and tissue extracts. it is
found in peripheral ruffles of spreading cells and is recruited
to membrane ruffles in cells induced to migrate in in vitro
wounding experiments.  xxxg1304xxx  colocalizes with talin in ruffles and binds to talin’s ⬃50-kda head domain (amino acids
280 – 435). other parts of talin (the ⬃220-kda tail fragment)
can bind ␤-integrin cytoplasmic tails, vinculin, and f-actin
and hence form an integrin-cytoskeleton linkage at sites of
891

bono et al.

cell-substratum contact (reviewed by critchley, 2000). talin’s head domain has been proposed to have a role in cell
motility and morphology (hemmings et al., 1996; bolton et
al., 1997) and an actin-binding site in the head domain may
provide a direct link between  xxxg1304xxx  and f-actin.  xxxg1304xxx 
therefore represents a membrane-binding site for talin in
ruffles, whereas integrins anchor talin in focal contacts
where no  xxxg1304xxx  expression can be found. although  xxxg1304xxx ’s
exact role in ruffles is currently unclear, one tempting model
is that  xxxg1304xxx  recruits talin to ruffles but is displaced by
integrins as more stable adhesions are established. this idea
is supported by the finding of calderwood et al. (1999) that
␤1-cytoplasmic domains can bind both to the head and rod
domain of talin and that the ␤1-binding site overlaps with
the  xxxg1304xxx -binding site in talin’s head domain.
 xxxg1304xxx ’s extracellular domain is homologous with the
carbohydrate-recognition domains (crd) of c-type lectins.
because  xxxg1304xxx  is a type i transmembrane protein, it has the
potential to mediate signals from extracellular matrix (ecm)
to the cell cytoskeleton, and, based on  xxxg1304xxx ’s homology to
 xxxg2048xxx ’s ligand-binding region (graves et al., 1994;
borowsky and hynes, 1998), one could speculate that  xxxg1304xxx 
may act in a manner analogous to selectins in mediating
transient interactions with the ecm. however, because no
binding partners for  xxxg1304xxx ’s extracellular part have been
described, we were interested to identify  xxxg1304xxx  ligands. for
this purpose, we have developed a chimeric protein containing the  xxxg1304xxx  extracellular region and the hinge and constant regions of human immunoglobulin (ig)g1. in this paper, we report that this soluble form of  xxxg1304xxx  binds to
hyaluronan (ha), an abundant component of the ecm, and
that the binding is specific for this glycosaminoglycan
(gag). because there is no sequence homology with any
previously known ha receptors, including cd44,  xxxg1061xxx 
(receptor for ha-mediated motility), or lyve-1 (lymphatic
vessel endothelial ha receptor-1),  xxxg1304xxx  represents a novel
member of the ha-binding protein family (stamenkovic et
al., 1989; hardwick et al., 1992; banerji et al., 1999). thus, by
binding to ha,  xxxg1304xxx  may facilitate cell migration by mediating early interactions between spreading cells and the
ecm.

materials and methods
chemicals, cells, and antibodies
dna-manipulating enzymes were from new england biolabs (beverly, ma). oligonucleotides and sequencing service were purchased
from massachusetts institute of technology cancer center biopolymer facility (cambridge, ma). chemicals were purchased from
sigma chemical (st. louis, mo) unless otherwise indicated. biotinylated ha (bha)-binding protein was from seikagaku (tokyo,
japan). ha dodecasaccharides were a gift from pipetten biotech
(uppsala, sweden) and were ⬎98% homogenous with regard to size
as judged from mass spectrometry and contained no contaminating
protein or nucleic acid.
chinese hamster ovary (cho) and nih3t3 cells were grown as
described previously (bono et al., 1998; bloom et al., 1999). mcf-7
breast carcinoma cells were grown in dmem supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum. the preparation and purification of polyclonal antisera against  xxxg1304xxx  have been described in detail
(borowsky and hynes, 1998). briefly, a synthetic peptide from the
20 carboxy-terminal amino acids was used to immunize rabbits, and
the resulting antisera were affinity purified with the peptide covalently coupled to thiopropyl-sepharose 6b. peroxidase-conju-

892

gated f(ab⬘)2 fragment of rabbit anti- xxxd2207xxx  was purchased
from dako (glostrup, denmark). biotin-conjugated goat anti- xxxd2207xxx  (fc) was from rockland (gilbertsville, pa), and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti- xxxd2207xxx  (fc-specific) was from sigma.

fc fusion plasmid constructions
the extracellular region of  xxxg1304xxx  was amplified from  xxxg1304xxx  cdna
by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides iggf1 (5⬘-tcc
cga att ctc tgc ctt agt ccc g-3⬘) and iggr1 (5⬘-tcc gct
cga ggc ttt ctt tga atg ttt c-3⬘) as primers. reaction
conditions for the amplification were 94°c for 1 min, 58°c for 1 min,
and 72°c for 1 min for 30 cycles. the amplified fragment was
digested with ecori and xhoi and introduced in-frame, upstream of
the hinge and fc region of human igg1 in a derivative of pcdm8
(pcdm8/fc; chen and nelson, 1996) also cleaved with ecori and
xhoi. the integrity of the construct was determined by sequencing.
thereafter, the  xxxg1304xxx -fc cdna was excised from pcdm8 using
noti and hindiii and ligated into expression vector pcep4 (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca) cleaved with noti and hindiii. finally, the
 xxxg1304xxx -fc construct in the expression vector was sequenced before
making a large-scale preparation of dna for transfections.
the cloning and detailed structures of cd44-fc and e-cadherin-fc
fusion plasmids were described earlier (aruffo et al., 1990; higgins
et al., 1998). cd44-fc fusion protein (the extracellular region of cd44
fused to the hinge and fc region of human igg1) was a generous gift
of dr. ivan stamenkovic (massachusetts general hospital, charlestown, ma).

production of fc fusion proteins
cho cells (5 ⫻ 106/transfection) were stably transfected with 20 ␮g
of plasmid dna using electroporation (0.3 kv, 960 ␮f, 0.4-cm
cuvette in rpmi plus 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mm l-glutamine
without serum; gene pulser apparatus, bio-rad, hercules, ca).
after transfections, the cells were selected in the presence of 400
␮g/ml hygromycin. after ⬃20 d, supernatants from wells containing resistant colonies were assayed for fusion proteins by western
blot analysis.
to produce  xxxg1304xxx -fc fusion proteins on a large scale, stably
transfected cho cells were grown in 175-cm2 flasks in 10% ultralow igg fetal bovine serum (life technologies, paisley, uk) and
400 ␮g/ml hygromycin. after the cells reached confluency, the
medium was harvested and purified with protein a-sepharose
cl-4b beads (amersham pharmacia biotech, uppsala, sweden).
after the sample was washed, the fusion proteins were eluted with
100 mm glycine, ph 3.0, and neutralized with one-tenth volume of
1 m tris-hcl, ph 8.0. the purified fusion proteins were dialyzed
into phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) and stored at ⫺20°c. finally,
the concentrations of the purified proteins were determined with
micro-bsa (bovine  xxxg124xxx ) protein assay kit (pierce, rockford, il) using bsa as a standard, and the purity of the fusion
proteins was analyzed by sds-page and coomassie staining.

sepharose
ha-eda-sepharose 4b (mccourt and gustafson, 1997) was kindly
provided by dr. paraskevi heldin (uppsala university, sweden).
unsubstituted sepharose 4b was used as a control in the binding
reactions. for the binding experiments, 0.5 ␮g of purified  xxxg1304xxx -fc
or e-cadherin-fc was incubated in the presence of 5 mm ca2⫹ for
2 h at 4°c. after the sample was centrifuged, the beads were washed
three times with pbs/ca2⫹ and then eluted with 2 mg/ml haspecific dodecasaccharides or with 170 ␮g/ml n-acetyl- xxxd2211xxx  ( xxxd2683xxx ; sigma). the elutions
were boiled in sds-page sample-loading buffer and loaded onto
sds-page gels. the eluted material was detected with horseradish

cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) precipitations
confluent plates of nih 3t3 cells (⬃4 ⫻ 106 cells) were washed
three times with pbs and lysed in 1 ml of pbs containing 0.5%
nonidet p-40. after addition of protease inhibitors, lysates were
incubated on ice for 15 min and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min
to remove insoluble material. aliquots of the lysate (50 ␮l) were
used to perform cpc precipitations essentially as described by lee
et al. (1992), using 50 ␮l of 1 mg/ml aqueous solutions of different
gags (ha [sigma h5388], heparin [heparan sulfate sodium salt
from porcine intestinal mucosa; sigma h9902], or  xxxd1687xxx  sodium salt [seikagaku] or  xxxd2683xxx  or h2o as
negative controls). after the sample was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, cpc was added to the gag/lysate mixture to a final
concentration of 1% (vol/vol) and incubated for 1 h. precipitates
containing gags and bound proteins were pelleted by centrifugation, washed three times with 1 ml of 1% cpc, 30 mm nacl, and
finally dissolved in 50 ␮l of sample-loading buffer and analyzed on
a 10% sds-page polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions
(100 mm dithiothreitol).

sds-page and western blot analysis
after proteins were electrophoretically resolved by size, they were
electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were
stained using a western blot chemiluminescence reagent from nen
life science products (boston, ma) according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. the detected signals were quantitated using alphaimager 1220 documentation and analysis system (alpha innotech, san leandro, ca).

binding of  xxxg1304xxx -fc to immobilized ha
binding of  xxxg1304xxx -fc fusion protein to immobilized ha (from
rooster comb; sigma h5388) was measured in 96-well microtiter
plates (maxisorp plate, nalge nunc international, rochester, ny).
the wells were coated overnight at 4°c with 2 mg/ml ha in coating
buffer (15 mm  xxxd3212xxx  and 34 mm sodium bicarbonate,
ph 9.3) and blocked for 2 h in 0.25% bsa and 0.05% tween-20 in
pbs. after the plates were washed three times with pbs, they were
incubated with purified fusion proteins for 2 h at room temperature.
after the unbound proteins were washed from the plates, the plates
were incubated with hrp-conjugated anti- xxxd2207xxx  antibody (or
streptavidin-hrp for bha-binding protein control reactions), the
reactions were developed using tetramethylbenzidine substrate
(dako tmb one-step substrate system), and the absorbances were
measured at 650 nm in a standard microplate reader. the values
expressed in figure 5 represent averages of duplicate determinations in at least three experiments with an sd ⱕ 10%.
to determine possible  xxxg1304xxx -fc binding to other gags,  xxxg1304xxx -fc
(10 ␮g/ml, a concentration from the linear part of the binding curve,
see figure 5a) was preincubated with free gags (1.5–200 ␮g/ml)
for 30 min on ice before incubation with ha immobilized to the
wells as described above (figure 5, c and d).

binding of soluble ha to immobilized  xxxg1304xxx 
purified ha was biotinylated according to the method of yu and
toole (1995). briefly, purified ha (40 – 60 kda, from seikagaku) was
dissolved in pbs at 5 mg/ml and dialyzed against 0.1 m 2-(nmorpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, ph 5.5 (sigma). biotin-lc- xxxd2396xxx  (pierce) in  xxxd1896xxx  was added to give a final concentration of 1 mm in the presence of 10 mm 1,ethyl-3-[3dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide buffer (pierce), dissolved in
2-(n-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer, and stirred overnight
at room temperature, followed by dialysis against pbs and a 15-h
centrifugation at 4°c to remove any precipitates. the biotinylation

reaction leads to a maximum of 1 in 10 –20 carboxyl groups in ha
becoming labeled, which has been reported to be sufficient for
sensitive detection and to preserve full binding activity of the labeled ha.
ninety-six–well polystyrene microtiter plates (costar, cambridge, ma) were coated with fc fusion proteins (1–50 ␮g/ml)
overnight at 4°c, washed three times to remove unbound material,
blocked, and incubated with bha (10 ␮g/ml) for a further 2 h.
bound bha was detected by incubation with hrp-conjugated
streptavidin (amersham pharmacia biotech) and tetramethylbenzidine as a substrate. absorbance was measured at 650 nm as described above.

 xxxg1304xxx -fc staining of tissue sections
tissue samples were freshly prepared from pancreata of rip1-tag2
transgenic mice that spontaneously develop solid tumors at the age
of 14 wk (hanahan, 1985; folkman et al., 1989). sections were cut
from liquid nitrogen-frozen tissue samples and stored at ⫺20°c.
the sections were air dried, fixed with acetone, and blocked for 30
min with 4% goat serum in pbs/0.05% tween-20. after a brief
pbs/tween-20 wash, sections were incubated at room temperature
for 45 min with 0.5 ␮g/ml purified  xxxg1304xxx  or e-cadherin-fc fusion
proteins diluted in 4% goat serum including 5 mm ca2⫹. after the
sections were stained with the primary reagent, they were washed
and incubated for 45 min with biotinylated goat anti-human fc
antibody diluted 1:200 in 2% mouse serum. the staining was visualized by the avidin-biotin complex technique using vectastain abc
kit (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca), and the sections were
finally slightly counterstained with hematoxylin.
for gag digestions the sections were incubated for 45 min at
37°c with 100 ␮g/ml hyaluronidase (from bovine testes, type i;
sigma) or heparitinase (gift from a. lander; university of california, irvine, ca) or with 0.5 u/ml chondroitinase (chondroitinase
abc lyase from proteus vulgaris; sigma), followed by washes and
blocking steps as described above.

adhesion assays
adhesion assays were conducted essentially as described previously (li et al., 1999). the wells of linbro 96-well microtiter plates
(icn-flow laboratories) were coated with 100 ␮l/well of 0.5
mg/ml bsa or 1 mg/ml human umbilical cord ha and blocked
overnight with 1% (wt/vol) bsa in tris-buffered saline. the wells
were subsequently washed two times with 20 mm hepes, ph 7.4,
137 mm nacl, and 3 mm kcl (hbs) before assays. expression
construct consisting of  xxxg1304xxx  cdna in plen/neo vector
(borowsky and hynes, 1998) was used to generate stably transfected mcf-7 cells after selection for 4 wk in the presence of 0.5
mg/ml  xxxd2191xxx  (life technologies).  xxxg1304xxx  transfectants or mock
controls were released from culture dishes using 0.02% (wt/vol)
trypsin, 2 mm cacl2, and hbs to minimize proteolysis. cells were
labeled with 5 ␮g/␮l calcein am (molecular probes, eugene, or)
by adding the fresh label to the trypsin medium. after 2 volumes of
0.04% (wt/vol) soy bean  xxxd207xxx  in hbs were added to the
sample and the sample was washed twice with hbs, the cells were
resuspended in hbs containing 0.1% (wt/vol) bsa and 1 mm
cacl2, added to coated microtiter plate wells, and incubated for 90
min at 37°c. after one to six washings with hbs and 1 mm cacl2
the fluorescence was measured with a 96-well plate reader. in each
assay, the percentage of adherent cells was determined by comparison with wells containing cells treated identically but not subjected
to the washings.

we chose to test  xxxg1304xxx  binding to ha for several reasons.
first,  xxxg1304xxx  is widely expressed on different cell types and
tissues (borowsky and hynes, 1998); therefore, it seemed
plausible that a ligand for  xxxg1304xxx  might be a ubiquitous
component of ecm. second, ha can promote cell adhesion
and motility (knudson and knudson, 1993; entwistle et al.,
1996), which are processes in which  xxxg1304xxx  is likely to play a
role. third,  xxxg1304xxx ’s extracellular domain is a c-type lectin,
and the three-dimensional structure of link domain (the
ha-binding domain found in many ha-binding proteins;
neame and barry, 1993; kohda et al., 1996) has revealed an
interesting structural homology between c-type lectins and
the link module. the structure of the link domain showed
that the predicted ha-binding site in the link domain is at
an analogous position to the carbohydrate-binding pocket in
the crd of  xxxg2048xxx , and  xxxg1304xxx ’s crd includes an identical insertion in the crd loop as does  xxxg2048xxx . therefore,
we decided to test the binding of  xxxg1304xxx -igg to ha immobilized on sepharose beads.
ha is a linear polysaccharide, which can be immobilized,
for example, to eda-sepharose (mccourt and gustafson,
1997). because ha-binding proteins can be purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized ha (tengblad,
1979), we incubated  xxxg1304xxx -igg as well as control igg with
ha-sepharose beads. the bound material was eluted with
ha dodecasaccharides, separated on sds-page gels, and
detected with anti- xxxd2207xxx  (fc specific) antibody. as
shown in figure 2a,  xxxg1304xxx -igg binds to ha-sepharose but
not to control sepharose beads. the bound  xxxg1304xxx -igg could
be released from the ha-sepharose beads with ha dodecasaccharides (figure 2a) and also with glycine or edta
(bono, rubin, higgins, and hynes, unpublished results).
ha octasaccharides were less effective in eluting  xxxg1304xxx -igg
(bono, rubin, higgins, and hynes, unpublished results).
the e-cadherin control fusion protein did not show any
binding to ha-sepharose; all the e-cadherin igg was found
in the flow-through fraction (figure 2b), confirming that the
 xxxg1304xxx  part of the igg fusion protein (and not the fc region)
is binding specifically to ha.

 xxxg1304xxx  binds to ha but not to other gags
to address further the specific interaction between  xxxg1304xxx 
and ha, we performed coprecipitation experiments with
ha, heparin,  xxxd1687xxx  or  xxxd2683xxx . in
these experiments, nih 3t3 cells were lysed in nonidet p-40
buffer before addition of gags, bound proteins were precipitated by addition of 1% cpc, and the precipitates were
resolved on sds-page gels and probed using an anti- xxxg1304xxx 
antibody. as shown in figure 3a,  xxxg1304xxx  was coprecipitated
only with ha. other gags tested did not significantly
precipitate  xxxg1304xxx , as indicated by much weaker signals in
molecular biology of the cell

figure 2. purified  xxxg1304xxx -fc fusion protein binds to immobilized ha.
(a)  xxxg1304xxx -fc fusion protein was incubated with ha-sepharose or
with sepharose control beads, and ha-specific dodecasaccharides
were used to elute the bound material from the beads. the flowthrough fractions (ft) and elutions were subjected to sds-page and
immunoblotting with anti- xxxd2207xxx  antibody. note that in sepharose control lanes all the signal is found in the ft fraction. a small
aliquot of the purified (unbound)  xxxg1304xxx  fc was run on a parallel lane
to show the location of the fusion protein in reduced conditions. (b) in
a similar binding experiment with the e-cadherin fc fusion protein,
elution with ha oligosaccharides does not result in any detectable
signal, and all the fusion protein is found in the ft lane. molecular
masses (in kda) are shown at the left.

the precipitation reactions. the results from two separate
experiments were quantitated to compare the binding of
 xxxg1304xxx  to different gags, and the quantitation clearly shows
that  xxxg1304xxx  binding is specific for ha (figure 3b).

 xxxg1304xxx  binds both immobilized and soluble ha
to study the interaction between  xxxg1304xxx  and ha, a binding
assay was developed in which soluble fusion proteins were
incubated with ha immobilized on 96-well plates. bound
fusion proteins were detected by adding hrp-conjugated
anti- xxxd2207xxx  antibodies, which recognized the human
igg portion of the fusion protein.  xxxg1304xxx -igg bound to ha
in a concentration-dependent manner similar to the binding
of cd44-igg or ha-binding protein (figure 4a). the control
e-cadherin-igg fusion protein did not show any significant
binding at similar concentrations. for all three ha-binding
proteins, the binding curves were biphasic, indicating complex binding kinetics. nevertheless, because the binding

but not other gags. (a) total cell lysates of 3t3 cells were incubated with different gags (50 ␮g each) and subjected to cpc
precipitation. precipitates and total cell lysate were resolved on an
sds-page gel and stained with anti- xxxg1304xxx  antibody after blotting
onto membrane. control reactions were precipitated with cpc
without addition of any gag or after addition of  xxxd2683xxx . the intensities of the precipitated  xxxg1304xxx  bands in two

curves showed similar patterns, it is possible to conclude
that the respective affinities are similar, differing not more
than two- to threefold. estimates of kd from the linear parts
of the binding curves gave values on the order of 10⫺7 m.
the specificity of the  xxxg1304xxx -igg binding was examined
by competition experiments in which free gags were
incubated with  xxxg1304xxx -igg before the mixture was added
to the wells coated with ha (figure 4c). the results
showed that neither heparin nor  xxxd1687xxx  could
block the binding at the tested concentrations (1.6 –200
␮g/ml). in contrast, preincubation of  xxxg1304xxx -igg with
soluble ha efficiently competed with the binding of  xxxg1304xxx -igg to immobilized ha in a manner almost identical
to its competition of cd44-igg binding to ha (figure 4d).
thus, the affinity of  xxxg1304xxx  for ha is of similar range as
the affinity of cd44 for ha.
reciprocally,  xxxg1304xxx ’s ability to bind soluble ha was
tested with soluble bha. ninety-six–well plates were coated
with  xxxg1304xxx -igg, blocked, and incubated with bha, and the
bound bha was detected with streptavidin-hrp secondary
reagent (figure 4b). the results show that  xxxg1304xxx -fc immobilized to polystyrene wells bound to bha in a concentration-dependent manner, and the binding pattern resembled
closely the binding of bha to cd44-fc.

data presented are representative of three individual binding

 xxxg1304xxx -fc binding to tissue sections is abolished
by hyaluronidase
to corroborate the results of the ha-sepharose and microtiter binding experiments, we stained frozen tissue sections
using  xxxg1304xxx -fc fusion protein as a histochemical reagent in
conjunction with biotinylated anti- xxxd2207xxx  and the hrpabc reagent. because tumors are frequently characterized
by local accumulation of ha in vivo (toole et al., 1979;
knudson et al., 1984), we stained sections from pancreata of
rip1-tag2 transgenic mice, which spontaneously develop
pancreatic tumors.
incubation of frozen sections from the pancreata of riptag2 mice with  xxxg1304xxx -fc showed positive staining of the
ecm of the tumors (figure 5b), whereas no staining was
observed with the e-cadherin-fc control (figure 5a). positive staining with e-cadherin-fc was observed in the epithelial cells of the surrounding mucosal tissues (bono, rubin,
higgins, and hynes, unpublished results), as expected, because e-cadherin is abundantly expressed on epithelial cells
(nose and takeichi, 1986).
to examine the specificity of the  xxxg1304xxx -fc staining, sections were pretreated with different gag-degrading enzymes before incubation with the fusion protein. pretreatment of the sections with hyaluronidase significantly
reduced the  xxxg1304xxx -fc reactivity (figure 5c), confirming that
896

the staining of the ecm in figure 5b is due to  xxxg1304xxx -fc
binding to ha present in the matrix. treatment of sections
with chondroitinase or heparitinase (figure 5, d and e,
respectively) did not significantly affect the  xxxg1304xxx -fc binding, indicating that ha is the predominant  xxxg1304xxx  ligand on
these tumor sections.

 xxxg1304xxx -transfected cells adhere to ha substrates
human mcf-7 breast cancer cells bind poorly to ha-coated
wells, and western blotting with anti- xxxg1304xxx  antibody (figure 6a) revealed that these cells do not express endogenous
 xxxg1304xxx . mcf-7 cells stably transfected with  xxxg1304xxx  cdna
were compared with mock-transfected controls in cell-substratum adhesion assays. figure 6b shows that  xxxg1304xxx -expressing cells adhered to ha-coated wells much better than
did control cells, and the enhanced binding of  xxxg1304xxx  transfectants could be detected even after repeated washes of
cells. thus,  xxxg1304xxx  is a functional ha receptor on cells and
can mediate cell adhesion.

acid and  xxxd2683xxx  (goa and benfield, 1994). it is
ubiquitously expressed in the extracellular space, represents
a major constituent of the ecm, and has a central role in
stability of ecm (knudson and knudson, 1993). numerous
cellular processes including cell migration (chen et al., 1989),
adhesion (klein et al., 1996), and proliferation (mast et al.,
1993; wiig et al., 1996) are influenced by ha. thus, ha has
an important role in such processes as morphogenesis
(toole, 1997), wound healing (nishida et al., 1991), inflammation (weigel et al., 1988), and immune cell trafficking
(mohamadzadeh et al., 1998), as well as in many aspects of
tumor biology (delpech et al., 1997).
many of the effects of ha are mediated via its interaction
with ha-binding proteins and receptors. the majority of the
ha-binding proteins contain a common protein module
termed link module, which is a structural domain of ⬃100
amino acids in length (neame and barry, 1993; kohda et al.,
1996). link modules have been described in several ecm
molecules (link protein,  xxxg33xxx ,  xxxg2407xxx ,  xxxg1507xxx , and
brevican) as well as on cell surface receptors. however, not
all ha-binding proteins contain a link domain, namely,
 xxxg1061xxx , cdc37, inter-␣- xxxd207xxx , plasma ha-binding protein, fibroblast ha-binding protein (reviewed by
day, 1999), and intracellular  xxxg2297xxx 
(hofmann et al., 1998). the best characterized ha cell surface receptors are cd44,  xxxg1061xxx , icam-1, and lyve-1
(entwistle et al., 1996; banerji et al., 1999), although there is
some controversy as to whether icam-1 is a genuine ha
receptor (mccourt and gustafson, 1997).
in this work we searched for a ligand for  xxxg1304xxx , a novel
talin-binding protein localized in membrane ruffles and
showed that  xxxg1304xxx  is a novel ha-binding cell surface receptor based on the following criteria: 1)  xxxg1304xxx -fc fusion
protein binds to ha immobilized on sepharose, and the
bound material can be eluted with highly purified ha dodecasaccharides; 2) ha, but not other tested gags, precipitates  xxxg1304xxx  in the presence of 1% cpc; 3)  xxxg1304xxx  binds to
vol. 12, april 2001

ha immobilized in microtiter wells, and soluble ha binds
to immobilized  xxxg1304xxx ; 4)  xxxg1304xxx -igg stains ha on frozen
tissue sections in a hyaluronidase-sensitive manner, whereas
chondroitinase or heparitinase treatment of the sections did
not affect the staining intensity; 5)  xxxg1304xxx -negative cells that
do not bind to ha in adhesion assays become adherent after
transfection with  xxxg1304xxx . thus,  xxxg1304xxx  is a member of the
family of ha-binding proteins and can serve as an habinding cell adhesion receptor.
 xxxg1304xxx  does not have obvious sequence identity with
previously cloned ha receptors and does not contain a link
module or a bx7b motif (an ␣-helical sequence with clusters
of basic amino acids), which is the ha-binding sequence in
 xxxg1061xxx  (yang et al., 1994), another ha receptor without a
link domain. however, the extracellular domain of  xxxg1304xxx  is
homologous with c-type lectins. the structural homology
between the link domain and c-type lectins probably accounts for  xxxg1304xxx ’s ability to bind ha (brissett and perkins,
1996; kohda et al., 1996).
although  xxxg1304xxx  and cd44, a known ha receptor, do not
share any sequence homology, there is an interesting parallel between  xxxg1304xxx  and cd44. they both bind to ha via their
extracellular part (link domain in cd44, lectin in  xxxg1304xxx ),
they both can bind to molecules of the erm superfamily
with their intracellular parts because cd44 has been reported to bind ezrin and merlin (sainio et al., 1997; heiska et
al., 1998; yonemura et al., 1998), and  xxxg1304xxx  can bind talin
and radixin (borowsky and hynes, 1998; cordero, unpublished data). for cd44, the erm-binding site has been
mapped to a positively charged 19-amino acid cluster in the
juxtamembrane region of the cytoplasmic domain (yonemura et al., 1998). however,  xxxg1304xxx  does not have an obvious
positively charged amino acid cluster next to the membranespanning region, and we have previously reported that the
shortest talin-binding motif is in the c terminus of  xxxg1304xxx ’s
cytoplasmic domain (borowsky and hynes, 1998). however,
similar extracellular and intracellular binding partners sug897

fluorogenic assay. data are presented as percentages of adherent
cells. means ⫾ sd are shown. data are representative of at least
three separate experiments. note that, even after repeated washes,
considerably more  xxxg1304xxx -mcf-7 cells than mock control cells bind
to ha.

gest possible shared functions between these molecules, and
therefore, it will be of interest to investigate whether  xxxg1304xxx 
also has a role in the processes of leukocyte migration to
inflamed sites, cell adhesion and migration, and tumor metastasis (gunthert et al., 1991; stamenkovic et al., 1991; degrendele et al., 1996, 1997), all processes in which cd44 is
known to play a role.
cd44 is known to have several isoforms due to alternative
splicing (haynes et al., 1991), although not all cd44 variants
can bind ha and/or mediate lymphocyte homing (berg et
al., 1989; stamenkovic et al., 1991). although  xxxg1304xxx  genomic
clones have not yet been analyzed, it will be of interest to
study whether there also exist different  xxxg1304xxx  isoforms.
based on a northern blot analysis of cho cell rna
(borowsky and hynes, 1998), there is so far no evidence for
multiple  xxxg1304xxx  forms, although it should be remembered
that there may be species-specific differences.
 xxxg1304xxx ’s binding to ha is not remarkably strong; the
affinity of  xxxg1304xxx  for ha is on the order of 10⫺7 m. based on
898

the similarities in the binding curves (figure 4)  xxxg1304xxx ’s
affinity for ha appears similar to that of cd44. in comparison with other cell adhesion mechanisms such as those
involving cadherins or integrins, the detected  xxxg1304xxx  affinity
for ha is fairly weak. however, there are situations in
which such weak binding may be an advantage. for example, in transient interactions, strong binding can be a disadvantage, and it is tempting to speculate that  xxxg1304xxx ’s function is to mediate early cell-matrix interactions followed by
more stable binding mediated, for example, by integrins.
 xxxg1304xxx ’s binding to ha may be affected by several factors
including  xxxg1304xxx ’s interactions with the cytoskeleton. the
cytoskeleton may indirectly control  xxxg1304xxx ’s binding to ha,
for example by controlling the distribution and clustering of
 xxxg1304xxx  on the cell surface. this could lead to possible multiple and higher affinity interactions between  xxxg1304xxx  and
ha, which may increase the binding avidity over that of a
monovalent interaction. such multivalent interactions, in
which several molecules of cd44 bind to the same ha
molecule, have been reported (underhill and toole, 1980;
underhill, 1992), and the importance of proper cytoskeletal
connection for cd44 binding to ha has also been suggested
by experiments in which cells transfected with cd44 with a
truncated cytoplasmic domain bind soluble ha less well
than do cells transfected with intact cd44 (lesley et al.,
1992). hence, it will be of interest to study whether cytoskeleton can regulate  xxxg1304xxx ’s distribution on the cell surface
and in this way regulate  xxxg1304xxx ’s binding to ha.
in conclusion, we have identified  xxxg1304xxx  as a novel receptor for ha.  xxxg1304xxx  binds specifically to ha but not to
heparin or  xxxd1687xxx  under the binding conditions
used in this study.  xxxg1304xxx ’s binding to this ecm component
suggests a role for  xxxg1304xxx  in processes in which ha is known
to be involved, including cell adhesion and motility. the
identification of ha as a ligand for  xxxg1304xxx  defines this talinbinding partner as a novel member of the diverse family of
ha-binding proteins and should facilitate attempts to find
the true biological role for  xxxg1304xxx .
