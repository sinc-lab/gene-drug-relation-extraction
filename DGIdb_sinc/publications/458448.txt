abstract-the effects of a variety of acyclic or heterocyclic gaba analogues on gaba receptor binding
and on high affinity transport of gaba in cultured astrocytes and mini-slices of brain cortex were
studied. the receptor and transport sites were found to be stereospecific and they exhibited opposite
stereoselectivity for (r) and (s)-trans-camino-cmethylcrotonic acid and (r) and (s)fl-proline. the
most potent inhibitors of gaba binding were (rs)-4,5-dihydromuscimol, muscimol, gaba, isoguvacine
and isonipecotic acid with icso values of, respectively, 0.009, 0.006, 0.033, 0.037 and 0.33 ~ l m .under
the present experimental conditions the following compounds inhibited preferentially the glial transport
system: (3rs,  xxxd1xxx )-4-hydroxynipecotic acid,  xxxd2248xxx , (rs)-n-methylnipecotic acid, (rs)-fi-proline and
8-alanine (icsovalues 10, 25, 70, 320 and ~ o o o ~ l mrespectively
,
vs. 200, 100, 300, 1200 and >5ooo
for neuronal transport). on the other hand, (r)-trans-4-amino-4-methylcrotonic
acid, (3rs,  xxxd1xxx , 5sr)-4hydroxy-5-methylnipecoticacid and (rs)-3-hydroxy-s-atninovalericacid preferentially inhibited neuronal transport as studied in mini-slices of brain cortex (ics0 values 160, 300 and 430 ~lm,respectively
vs. 500, > so00 and 1400 j i for

and the analogues at different concentrations (max. 5000 pm). the inhibition
of gaba uptake (corrected for the non-saturable component) was calculated

the value at each concentration of analogue was the average of 5-6 results

results
effects of acyclic compounds on gaba binding and
transport
the effects of a series of acyclic gaba analogues
and gaba itself on high affinity gaba transport
in astrocytes and ‘prisms’ and gaba receptor binding are shown in table 1. it is seen that gaba was
the most potent inhibitor both of transport and binding and that 4-methyl derivatives of gaba and
trans-4-aminocrotonic acid showed characteristic
stereospecificity for the different recognition sites. the
r-forms of the compounds were relatively potent inhibitors of both transport systems, whereas the corresponding s-forms and in particular the s-form of
trans-camino-4-methylcrotonic acid were essentially
without effect. the stereospecificity for gaba binding was reversed for the crotonic acid derivatives, the
s-form being the most potent inhibitor. no stereospecificity was noted with r- and s-4-methyl gaba,
with both optical antipodes being relatively potent
inhibitors.
the introduction of a hydroxyl group in the 3-posi-

tion of r- and s-4-methyl gaba leads to inactive
compounds with respect to transport and binding. in
contrast, however, 3-hydroxy-5-aminovaleric acid, in
which the amino group has been moved from the
4- to the 5-position, was found to be a relatively
potent inhibitor of neuronal transport whereas it was
only a weak inhibitor of the glial transport and
gaba binding. the unsaturated analogue of
5-a1~inovalericacid, trans-5-amino-2-pentenoic acid,
had no effect on the transport systems. the two latter
compounds were weak inhibitors of gaba-binding.
p-alanine was found to be a relatively weak inhibitor
of gaba transport in astrocytes and it was without
effect on gaba uptake in brain cortex (‘prisms’).
s-2,4-diaminobutyric acid, on the other hand, had
no effect on the glial uptake, but inhibited gaba
uptake in ‘prisms’.  xxxd439xxx  had no effect
on gaba transport in either astrocytes or ‘prisms’.

tion sites are summarized in table 2. it is seen that,
with the exception of /i-proline which turned out to
be a selective inhibitor of gaba uptake in astrocytes,
none of these compounds had any appreciable effect
on gaba transport. these compounds did, however,
include some of the most potent displacers of gaba
binding such as muscimol and (rs)-4,5-dihydromuscimol, which are the most potent gaba agonists presently known, with ic5, values of 0.006 and 0.009 p ~
respectively. i.e. approx 4-5 times as potent as gaba
itself (cj. table i).
from the ic,, value for inhibition of glial transport by (+)/i-proline (320 p ~ and
)
s-( +)b-proline
(1900 p ~ an) ic,, value of about 150 pm for r-( -)/iproline, which has not yet been synthesized, may be
anticipated. it is seen that any change in the j-proline
molecule, such as introduction of a hydroxy group
on the ring or a double bond or an oxygen atom
in the ring, reduces or abolishes the inhibitory effect
of the compounds concerned on the glial gaba
transport.
like muscimol, /i-proline was found to interfere
with gaba binding although it was much less potent
than the former compound. it is seen that the s-form
which is without effect on transport was more potent

than the racemate. also, some of the /i-proline derivatives displaced gaba from the receptor, the unsaturated compound 3-pyrroline-3-carboxylic acid being
moderately potent.
effect of six-membered rings on g a b a binding and
transport

these compounds may be separated into two
, classes (4 fig. i), namely derivatives of piperidine-3carboxylic acid (nipecotic acid) and of piperidine-4carboxylic acid (isonipecotic acid) and it can be seen
from table 3 that those belonging to the former class
selectively inhibit the transport, having no effect on
binding, whereas the latter class of compounds interferes selectively with gaba binding to the postsynaptic receptors.
the most potent inhibitors of the gaba transport
processes are found among the derivatives of nipecotic acid, although the amino-derivatives were without
effect on both transport systems despite the fact that
they are structural analogues of 2,4-diaminobutyric
acid as well as of nipecotic acid, both of which inhibit
neuronal gaba transport (tables 1 and 3). it is also
seen that both transport systems showed stereospecificity for the optical isomers of nipecotic acid, the

(rtform being most inhibitory. it should be noted
that 4-hydroxy-nipecotic acid was a more potent inhibitor of the glial than of the neuronal uptake system
under the present experimental conditions. the
5-methyl derivatives of both this compound and of
 xxxd2248xxx  are seen to be less potent inhibitors than
the parent compounds but (3rs,  xxxd1xxx , ssr)-chydroxy5-methylnipecotic acid seems to be a selective inhibitor of neuronal gaba transport, in contrast to
4-hydroxynipecotic acid.
it can also be seen from table 3 that isoguvacine
is a more potent gaba receptor agonist than its
saturated analogue isonipecotic acid (fig. i). the introduction of a hydroxy group in the 3-position of
isonipecotic acid gave a weaker gaba agonist,
whereas the analogous 4-hydroxy derivative of isonipecotic acid was without effect on gaba binding.
the aminoderivatives of isonipecotic acid were found
to have no effect on gaba binding or on transport.
none of the following compounds were found to
have any significant effect on either gaba transport or gaba binding: ecgonine, nor-ecgonine,
$-ecgonine, nor-$-ecgonine and (lr, ss)-znortropene-2-carboxylic acid.
discussion
the differential effect of the optical isomers of
rrans-4-amino-4-methyl-crotonicacid on the gaba

recognition sites demonstrate a high degree of stereoselectivity of these sites although the gaba molecule
itself is not optically active. a similar phenomenon
is exhibited by several enzymes acting on symmetrical
molecules (dixon
& webb, 1964). the results also
show that the receptor and the transport sites exhibit
opposite stereo selectivity for the c-4 hydrogens of
the compounds concerned. the observed icso value
for the (r)-isomer of trans-4-amino-4-methylcrotonic
acid on gaba uptake in mini-slices is somewhat
higher than a corresponding value obtained by johnston et al. (1979) in a study where a much lower
gaba concentration was used. this is analogous to
the higher ic,, for (r)-.l-methyl-gaba compared to
that reported by beart& johnston
(1973) who also
used a much lower gaba concentration. such a difference is to be expected if the inhibition by these
compounds is of the competitive type, which is the
case for 4-methyl-gaba (beart& johnston,1973).
the somewhat higher ics0 value for (r)-trans-4amino-4-methylcrotonic acid in astrocytes than in
‘prisms’ may indicate that this compound preferentially inhibits the neuronal uptake system, but a more
detailed kinetic study is needed before any definite
conclusion can be reached. a similar selectivity was
observed for (rs)-3-hydroxy-5-aminovalericacid
which inhibited the neuronal transport system but
had essentially no effect on glial transport. it is
