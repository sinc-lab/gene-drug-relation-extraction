abstract the environmental pollutant 3-meso2–dde
[2-(3-methylsulfonyl-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)1,1-dichloroethene] is an adrenocortical toxicant in mice,
speciwcally in the glucocorticoid-producing zona fasciculata, due to a cytochrome p450 11b1 ( xxxg571xxx )-catalysed
bioactivation and formation of covalently bound protein
adducts. o,p⬘-ddd [ xxxd2656xxx ] is toxic and inhibits steroidogenesis in the human adrenal cortex after bioactivation by
unidentiwed cyps, but does not exert any toxic evects on
the mouse adrenal. as a step towards determining in vitro/
in vivo relationships for the cyp-catalysed binding and
toxicity of 3-meso2–dde and o,p⬘-ddd, we have investigated the irreversible protein binding of these two toxicants
in the murine adrenocortical cell line y-1. the irreversible
binding of 3-meso2–dde previously demonstrated in vivo
was successfully reproduced and could be inhibited by the
cyp-inhibitors etomidate, ketoconazole and  xxxd2633xxx .
surprisingly, o,p⬘-ddd reached similar levels of binding as
3-meso2–dde. the binding of o,p⬘-ddd was sensitive to
etomidate and ketoconazole, but not to  xxxd2633xxx . moreover, gsh depletion increased the binding of 3-meso2–
dde, but not of o,p⬘-ddd, indicating an important role of
gsh conjugation in the detoxiwcation of the 3-meso2–
dde-derived reactive metabolite. in addition, the speciwcity
of  xxxg571xxx  in activating 3-meso2–dde was investigated

using structurally analogous compounds. none of the
analogues produced histopathological lesions in the mouse
adrenal in vivo following a single i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg
body weight, but two of the compounds were able to decrease
the irreversible binding of 3-meso2–dde to y-1 cells. these
results indicate that the bioactivation of 3-meso2–dde by
 xxxg571xxx  is highly structure-dependent. in conclusion,
both 3-meso2–dde and o,p⬘-ddd bind irreversibly to
y-1 cells despite diverences in binding and adrenotoxicity
in mice in vivo. this reveals a notable in vitro/in vivo discrepancy, the contributing factors of which remain unexplained. we consider the y-1 cell line as appropriate for
studies of the cellular mechanisms behind the adrenocortical toxicity of these substances.

introduction
the ddt-metabolite and environmental pollutant 2-(3-methylsulfonyl-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene (3-meso2–dde) gives rise to extensive cell death in
the mouse adrenal cortex, speciwcally in the glucocorticoidproducing zona fasciculata cells (lund et al. 1988). this
tissue-speciwc toxicity arises after enzymatic bioactivation
into an as yet structurally uncharacterised reactive intermediate, which binds irreversibly to adrenal proteins (lund
et al. 1988; lund and lund 1995). initial in vitro studies
using mouse adrenal homogenates showed that the irreversible binding by 3-meso2–dde to adrenal proteins was
probably cytochrome p450 (cyp)-catalysed, since addition
of the cyp-inhibitor  xxxd2633xxx  decreased the binding
(lund et al. 1988; jönsson et al. 1991). a subsequent

123

794

study showed that the bioactivation was caused by the
mitochondrial  xxxg571xxx  (lund and lund 1995). the physiological function of  xxxg571xxx  is to catalyse the formation
of corticosterone and cortisol from the precursors 11deoxycorticosterone (doc) and 11-deoxycortisol, respectively. mitochondrial changes occur within 6 h after an i.p.
injection of a low dose of 3-meso2–dde (3 mg/kg) in
mice (jönsson et al. 1991), indicating that the site of bioactivation is also the primary target of toxicity. accordingly,
using mouse adrenal homogenates, a 50 times higher binding of 3-meso2–dde to mitochondrial than to microsomal
fractions has been demonstrated (jönsson et al. 1991).
o,p⬘-ddd [2-(2-chloro-phenyl) -2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,
1-dichloroethane], a ddt-metabolite as well, is an established adrenocortical toxicant that for many years has been
used for treatment of human adrenocortical carcinoma
(acc). in similarity to 3-meso2–dde, o,p⬘-ddd is activated into a reactive intermediate that binds irreversibly to
adrenal proteins in several species (martz and straw 1980;
cai et al. 1995). humans and dogs are sensitive (hart et al.
1973; cai et al. 1995), while mice do not respond with toxicity in the adrenal cortex following a single i.p. dose as
high as 100 mg/kg o,p⬘-ddd (lund et al. 1988). in line
with this observation, o,p⬘-[14c]ddd does not give rise to
any notable binding in the adrenal cortex in mice in vivo
(lund et al. 1986). moreover, mouse adrenal tissue slices
incubated with o,p⬘-[14c]ddd showed a very weak binding
in the zona fasciculata and reticularis (lindhe et al. 2001).
the y-1 cell line originates from a murine corticosterone-producing adrenocortical tumour (yasumura et al.
1966). y-1 cells produce several steroid hormones but lack
the ability to express  xxxg579xxx  and consequently has no
capacity to produce the main glucocorticoid in mice, corticosterone, without supply of the precursor 11-doc (parker
et al. 1985). however, the y-1 cells express  xxxg571xxx ,
which can be induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator
 xxxd1742xxx  (rice et al. 1989; wong et al. 1989; rainey et al.
2004). the y-1 cell line has earlier been used to study the
evects of environmental pollutants, e.g., 3-meso2–dde
and meso2–pcbs, on  xxxg571xxx -catalysed corticosterone
formation (johansson et al. 1998). it has also been shown
that 3-meso2–dde binds irreversibly to y-1 cells after
 xxxd1742xxx  induction (lund and lund 1995).
there are considerable species diverences regarding
adrenal bioactivation and subsequent toxicity of 3-meso2–
dde (brandt et al. 1992), and so far the mouse is the most
sensitive species studied (jönsson et al. 1991). even though
3-meso2–dde has been demonstrated to bind to human
adrenal tissue slices (lindhe et al. 2002) and inhibit glucocorticoid synthesis in the human adrenocortical cell line
h295r (johansson et al. 2002), there is no conclusive evidence that 3-meso2–dde is bioactivated and/or causes
toxicity in the human adrenal in vivo. in a longer perspec-

123

arch toxicol (2007) 81:793–801

tive, we aim to estimate human sensitivity since 3-meso2–
dde has been suggested as a potential drug candidate for
acc (lindhe et al. 2002). as a wrst step, we want to establish the in vitro/in vivo relationship for mice/y-1 cell line
and thereafter establish an interspecies link using the y-1
and h295r cell lines. during this process, we want to compare 3-meso2–dde with the current drug used for acc,
o,p⬘-ddd, in both species. this comparison is of great
interest since o,p⬘-ddd, which is adrenocorticolytic in
human adrenals in vivo, can serve as a reference substance.
the main objective of the present study was to evaluate and
characterise the binding of 3-meso2–dde and o,p⬘-ddd
in the y-1 cell line, and compare the results with previous
observations in the adrenal following exposure of mice
in vivo. evects of glutathione (gsh) depletion and various
cyp inhibitors were examined. finally, we screened some
substances with structural similarities to 3-meso2–dde
with regard to their ability to cause histopathological
lesions in the mouse adrenal in vivo and to interact with the
binding of 3-meso2–dde in y-1 cells, presumably by
competing for the bioactivating enzyme  xxxg571xxx . the
results show that the in vivo irreversible binding of 3meso2–dde in mice could be reproduced in the y-1 cell
line, after what appears to be a very structure-speciwc bioactivation. gsh seemed to be involved in the detoxiwcation
of the reactive intermediate. unexpectedly, o,p⬘-ddd was
also found to bind irreversibly to y-1 cells after a cypmediated reaction.

materials and methods
cell culture
the mouse adrenocortical y-1 cell line (atcc ccl-79)
was obtained from the american type culture collection
(atcc) and maintained in ham’s f12k medium (atcc)
containing 1.2 g/l sodium bicarbonate and 2.5 mm l-glutamine, supplemented with 15% horse serum (sigma-aldrich) and 2.5% fetal bovine serum (sigma-aldrich). the
cells were kept in a humidiwed atmosphere at 37°c and 5%
co2.

purity > 98%), o,p⬘-[14c]ddd (speciwc activity 414 kbq/

(purity > 99%) were synthesised by synthelec ab,
ideon (lund, sweden). o,p⬘-ddd (purity > 99%),  xxxd1742xxx ,
dl-buthionine-(s,r)-sulfoximine (bso), etomidate,  xxxd2633xxx , 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (mtt) and dmso were obtained from sigma-aldrich
(stockholm, sweden). the bca protein assay kit was
obtained from nordic biolabs (täby, sweden) and ketoconazole from icn biomedicals inc. (oh, usa).
irreversible binding assay
the irreversible protein binding of 3-meso2–dde and
o,p⬘-ddd to y-1 cells was determined, using the method of
wallin et al. (1981), with modiwcations for application on
the cell line. presumably, the measured binding is covalent,
but we choose to refer to it as irreversible or non-extractable binding. since we, during studies for optimisation of
the method, managed to inhibit the binding of both substances extensively with cyp-inhibitors, we conclude that
the employed method gives rise to very low unspeciwc
background binding. all experiments were repeated at least
three times, except for incubations over time, which were
repeated twice, and all concentrations and time points were
investigated in triplicates. y-1 cells were seeded in six-well
plates for 36 h, reaching 50% conxuency. all experiments
described below were preceded by a 24-h pre-treatment
with 10 m  xxxd1742xxx  in complete growth medium. when
we aimed to inhibit gsh synthesis, bso was added in a
wnal concentration of 1 mm (dissolved in water) during the
24-h  xxxd1742xxx  pre-treatment. to investigate the binding
over time, cells were incubated with 3-meso2–[14c]dde
or o,p⬘-[14c]ddd (2.4 kbq/sample diluted with unlabeled
substances to a total concentration of 10 m) in serum-free
medium for 7.5 min-8 h (37°c, 5% co2). to investigate
the concentration-dependent binding, radioactive substances (2.4 kbq/sample) diluted with various amounts of
unlabelled substance to wnal concentrations of 2.5–20 m
were incubated with the cells for 6 h. for studies aiming to
modify the irreversible binding, the cells were pre-incubated 30 min with cyp-inibitors or 3-meso2–dde analogues before addition of radioactive substances (2.4 kbq/
sample; 10 m) and then further incubated for 6 h in
serum-free medium. all substances used were dissolved in
dmso (except for bso) and added from 1,000-fold stock

795

solutions. for all experiments,  xxxd1742xxx -induced control
cells (only vehicle added) were incubated in triplicates.
after incubation, the medium was removed and 600 l pbs
was immediately added to each well. the cells were
scraped and transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.
the scraping procedure was repeated to collect remaining
cells. the tubes were centrifuged at 4,000g for 10 min
(4°c), and the resulting pellets were resuspended in
150 l pbs buver. cell suspensions were then stored at
¡70°c until analysis. the suspensions were sonicated,
and 100 l of the homogenates were transferred to glass
microwber wlter paper discs (whatman gf/c, diameter
2.5 cm). the remains of the homogenates were saved for
protein measurement using the bca protein assay kit.
to remove unbound substance, the wlter discs were washed
in 95% ethanol, 2£ methanol, 2£ acetone and n-heptane
(10 min for each wash). the wlters were then dried and
immersed in 10 ml scintillation xuid (ultima gold™,
packard instrument co., usa). the radioactivity was
measured in a liquid scintillation analyser (tri-carb
1900ca, packard instrument co.). following subtraction
of background radioactivity (control wells), the irreversible
binding was calculated and expressed as pmol substance/mg
protein.
mtt viability assay
the mtt viability assay was performed essentially as by
tada et al. (1986). y-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates
24 h before the assay. each compound, concentration and
time-point tested in the irreversible binding assay was
assayed in triplicate wells with and without the addition of
10 m 3-meso2–dde or o,p⬘-ddd. the same incubation
protocol as for the irreversible binding assay was used.
cells were pre-treated for 24 h with 10 m  xxxd1742xxx  (and a
wnal concentration of 1 mm bso when studying gsh
depletion) in complete growth medium. the cells were then
incubated with the test compounds in serum-free medium
for 6 h (37°c, 5% co2). four hours into this incubation
period, 20 l of mtt (5 mg/ml in pbs) was added to each
well. formed formazan crystals were dissolved by the addition of 100 l 10% sds in 0.01 m hydrochloric acid and
incubated overnight (37°c, 5% co2). absorbance was
measured at 560 nm and background absorbance at 750 nm
was subtracted. absorbance values were normalised against
solvent controls.
determination of non-protein sulfhydryls (np-sh)
concentrations of np-sh groups were determined by the
method of sedlak and lindsay (1968), using triplicate
samples. the cells were grown in 25 cm2 xasks to approximately 50% conxuence. the medium was then replaced

123

796

with fresh medium containing a wnal concentration of
1 mm bso or vehicle. after 24-h incubation with bso or
h2o, the cells were trypsinised and transferred to a 1.5-ml
microcentrifuge tube. the preparation of the cells was performed according to ikediobi et al. (2004). proteins were
precipitated by addition of 50% tca. both just before and
2 min after addition of 50 l 0.01 m 5,5⬘-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (dntb) dissolved in methanol, the absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer (pharmacia
biotech novaspec ii, boule nordic ab, huddinge, sweden) at 412 nm. the concentrations of np-sh were calculated with lambert–beers law ( = 13.6 l/mmol £ cm). the
protein concentrations were measured using the bca protein assay kit.
histopathology
female c57bl mice were obtained from scanbur bk ab
(sollentuna, sweden). the animals were housed with a
12 h light/dark cycle, given a standard pellet diet and tap
water ad libitum. prior to the experiments, the mice were
allowed to acclimatise for 7 days. the studies were
approved by the local ethics committee for research on
animals (tierp, sweden, permission no. c76/2). mice
(20.0 § 0.7 g; n = 4 per group) were given a single i.p.
injection of vehicle (corn oil, 10 ml/kg body weight) or
a structural analogue to 3-meso2–dde (100 mg/kg
body weight). this dose is eight times higher than the lowest
observed dose of 3-meso2–dde that gives rise to histopathological lesions in the adrenal zona fasciculata, demonstrated using light microscopy, 24 h after an i.p. injection
(lund et al. 1988). the following analogues were screened
for histopathology: 2-meso2–dde, 3-meso2–o,p⬘-dde,
3-meso2–ddmu, 3-so2oh–dde, 3-so2nh2–dde,
3-no2–dde, 3-nh2–dde and bis-meso2–dde. to
serve as a positive control 3-meso2–dde was also
tested. the mice were killed in groups of two by cervical
dislocation at 24 or 72 h after injection, and the adrenals
were quickly excised and immediately wxed in 4% phosphate-buvered formaldehyde (ph 7.4). the adrenals
were embedded in historesin (kulzer histo-technik,
germany), sectioned (2 m) and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin. sections were investigated using a leica dmrxe
light microscope.

results
mtt viability assay
the mtt viability assay showed no reduction in cell metabolic capacity after exposure to any of the chemicals used
in the irreversible binding experiments (data not shown).
similarly, no evect on mtt occurred in cells exposed to
1 mm bso for 24 h. the binding results were consequently
not expected to be inxuenced by cytotoxicity.
irreversible binding of 3-meso2–dde and o,p⬘-ddd
to y-1 cells
despite a presumed enzymatic transformation of 3-meso2–
[14c]dde and o,p⬘-[14c]ddd into metabolites during
the cell incubations we will from now on refer to the parent
compounds. a pronounced non-extractable binding of
3-meso2–[14c]dde to proteins from y-1 cells was observed.
without the 24-h  xxxd1742xxx  pre-treatment, the irreversible
binding was only about 29% compared to the binding in the
 xxxd1742xxx -treated cells, conwrming that the binding was
preceded by a  xxxd1742xxx -induced enzymatic bioactivation.
the binding increased with time, starting within minutes and
then rapidly increasing during the wrst hour (fig. 1). during
the following hours of incubation, the binding curve was
xattened. the binding was also concentration-dependent as
shown in fig. 2a.
we observed a marked irreversible binding of o,p⬘[14c]ddd to y-1 proteins. without the 24-h  xxxd1742xxx 
pre-treatment, the irreversible binding was three times
lower compared to the binding in the  xxxd1742xxx -treated
cells. as shown in fig. 2b the binding was concentrationdependent. the binding started within 30 min and then
increased during the following hours of incubation
(fig. 1), showing a markedly diverent binding prowle than
3-meso2–dde.

statistics
statistical analysis was performed using a paired ratio t test
(graphpad prism, version 3.03). irreversible binding in
cells treated with cyp-inhibitors or 3-meso2–dde analogues were compared to the binding in cells treated with
vehicle only.

m 11-doc did not alter the binding of any of the labelled
substances, while 100 m decreased the binding of
o,p⬘-ddd to 38.5% of the control.
involvement of gsh
the np-sh concentration in untreated (control) cells was
calculated to 140 § 5 nmol/mg protein. treatment for 24 h
with 1 mm bso resulted in a decrease of np-sh to 41% of
the control (fig. 3a). this shows that bso evectively
depletes np-sh-levels with the employed incubation
protocol.
the binding of 3-meso2–dde was approximately doubled after pre-treatment with 1 mm bso (fig. 3b). the
increased binding was statistically signiwcant (p < 0.001).
in contrast, the binding of o,p⬘-ddd remained unavected
after 24 h of bso pre-treatment (fig. 3b).

(10 m), ketoconazole (10 m) and  xxxd2633xxx  (100 m)
signiwcantly reduced the binding. the binding of o,p⬘-ddd
was signiwcantly inhibited by etomidate (10 m) and
ketoconazole (10 m). neither 10 nor 100 m  xxxd2633xxx 
seemed to inhibit the binding of o,p⬘-ddd binding. ten

the inxuence of the 3-meso2–dde analogues on the
binding of 3-meso2–dde to y-1 proteins. out of seven
3-meso2–dde analogues examined, only 3-meso2–o,p⬘dde and 2-meso2–dde signiwcantly reduced the binding
of 3-meso2–dde.
histopathology
as expected, 100 mg/kg of 3-meso2–dde gave rise to
vacuolisation and extensive cell death in the mouse adrenal
zona fasciculata 24 h after the injection. at 72 h, the damaged cells had disappeared, leaving a region of collapsed
tissue in the remaining zona fasciculata. the 3-meso2–
dde analogues did not cause any visible toxicity to the
mouse adrenal cortex at any investigated time point.

discussion
we demonstrate a time- and concentration-dependent irreversible binding of both 3-meso2–dde and o,p⬘-ddd to
 xxxd1742xxx  stimulated y-1 cells. we successfully depleted
almost 60% of the gsh content in the cells and showed that
gsh conjugation is probably an important detoxiwcation
pathway for 3-meso2–dde, but not for o,p⬘-ddd, in y-1
cells. additionally, by studying some structural analogues
of 3-meso2–dde, both in vivo and in vitro, we conclude
that the bioactivation and toxicity of 3-meso2–dde by
 xxxg571xxx  seems to be highly structure-dependent.

 xxxd1742xxx  mimics the evects of acth and serves to
increase camp synthesis (seamon et al. 1981), and subsequently stimulates expression of several genes that are
important for steroidogenesis, e.g.,  xxxg571xxx  and
 xxxg570xxx  (rice et al. 1989; wong et al. 1989; black et al.

123

arch toxicol (2007) 81:793–801

1993; guo et al. 1993; mukai et al. 1998). we use  xxxd1742xxx 
instead of acth, as the y-1 cell line is unresponsive to
atch (rainey et al. 2004). the increased binding caused
by  xxxd1742xxx  pre-treatment conwrms that one or several  xxxd1742xxx -regulated enzymes were involved in the bioactivation
of 3-meso2–dde and o,p⬘-ddd into reactive intermediates. in rodents,  xxxg570xxx  expression is conwned to all
three adrenocortical zones (pelletier et al. 2001).  xxxg572xxx 
are expressed speciwcally in zona glomerulosa, while
 xxxg571xxx , according to literature, is expressed both in zona
fasciculata and reticularis (domalik et al. 1991; ogishima
et al. 1992). o,p⬘-ddd is known to interfere with both
 xxxg571xxx  and  xxxg570xxx  (hart and straw 1971; hart et al.
1971) and thereby inhibit steroidogenesis, although the
cyp isoform(s) catalysing reactive intermediate formation
and irreversible binding of o,p⬘-ddd remains unknown.
considering the previously observed localisation of a very
low but speciwc binding of o,p⬘-ddd in the zona fasciculata and reticularis ex vivo (lindhe et al. 2001), both
 xxxg570xxx  and  xxxg571xxx  could be involved in the activation of o,p⬘-ddd in the mouse adrenal cortex. 3-meso2–
dde shows a high and speciwc irreversible binding
conwned in zona fasciculata in vivo and ex vivo, an adrenocortical zone expressing both  xxxg571xxx  and  xxxg570xxx .
however, since it has been shown, using transfected
cos-cells, that  xxxg570xxx  is unable to metabolise 3meso2–dde (lund and lund 1995) we conclude that
 xxxg571xxx  is the only  xxxd1742xxx -inducible cyp enzyme
involved in the metabolic activation of 3-meso2–dde in
the adrenal cortex in mice. furthermore, since  xxxg570xxx  and
 xxxg571xxx  are localised to the mitochondrial inner membrane, mitochondria should be an expected primary target
for the reactive intermediates formed from 3-meso2–dde
and o,p⬘-ddd. for 3-meso2–dde, this assumption is supported by observed early mitchondrial changes in mice
in vivo and extensive binding to mouse adrenal mitochondrial fractions (jönsson et al. 1991). a preliminary binding
test, using the y-1 cells, showed a 2.4 and 3.7 times higher
binding (on a protein weight basis) to the pellet gained from
a 9,000£g centrifugation than to the supernatant gained
from a 12,000£g centrifugation, for 3-meso2–dde and
o,p⬘-ddd, respectively. the 9,000£g pellet was presumed
to contain mainly mitochondria, while the 12,000£g supernatant was presumed to contain microsomal and cytosolic
proteins. most likely, large fractions of the reactive intermediates formed from both substances bind close to the site of
formation in the mitochondria in y-1 cells, but metabolites
are formed and/or bound in other cellular compartments as
well.
considering the large diverence in binding and toxicity
of o,p⬘-ddd and 3-meso2–dde in the murine adrenal
cortex in vivo (lund et al. 1986, 1988), the magnitude of
binding to y-1 cells was surprisingly similar. the rate of

arch toxicol (2007) 81:793–801

activation and irreversible binding of o,p⬘-ddd and
3-meso2–dde in y-1 cells should be expected to diver
much more than we found. several factors may contribute
to this in vitro/in vivo discrepancy. (1) the high lipophilicity
and low speciwc activities of the labelled test compounds
limited the range of concentrations (2.5–20 m) that could
be examined in cell culture. bearing these restrictions
in mind, the shapes of the concentration-binding curves
(fig. 2) suggest that the rate of cyp-catalysed binding at low
concentrations, relevant for the in vivo exposure situation,
would be expected to be higher for 3-meso2–dde than for
o,p⬘-ddd. (2) we revealed, in a recent pharmacokinetic study
of o,p⬘-ddd and 3-meso2–dde in minipigs, that o,p⬘-ddd
reaches lower plasma concentrations and shows a higher
clearance from plasma and fat than 3-meso2–dde
(hermansson et al. 2007). consequently, at a similar dose,
the exposure of the adrenal would probably be higher for
3-meso2–dde than for o,p⬘-ddd. (3) the expression and
activity levels of the bioactivating cyp isoforms in the
mouse adrenal in vivo compared to the transformed y-1
cell line may diver. this diverence could then generate
an in vitro binding, not to be seen in vivo and not necessarily leading to toxicity. even if toxicity and covalent
protein binding of a substance are strongly associated
(cohen et al. 1997), it is crucial for the occurrence of toxic
evects, what proteins that are avected by the covalent
binding.
reactive electrophilic phase l metabolites are frequently
inactivated by glutathione-s-transferase-catalysed glutathione (gsh) conjugation. if this detoxiwcation system is
overwhelmed by reactive metabolites, the subsequent gsh
depletion may result in increased irreversible macromolecular binding and toxicity, and also in enhanced toxicity via
other mechanisms, e.g., by promoting oxidative stress
(gonzalez 2005). to examine the role of gsh for the inactivation of the adrenocorticolytic 3-meso2–dde and o,p⬘ddd metabolites, y-1 cells were exposed to bso, an
inhibitor of -glutamylcysteine synthetase. the np-sh
assay showed that 1 mm bso eyciently depleted np-sh
without causing cytotoxicity in the y-1 cells. as it has been
reported that np-sh groups are exclusively represented by
gsh in the rat adrenal (sedlak and hanus 1982), we
assume that this applies also for the mouse adrenal as well
as the y-1 cell line. while np-sh levels were reduced
about 2.5 times in bso-exposed y-1 cells, the binding of 3meso2–dde was doubled by bso treatment. these
results support earlier wndings (lund et al. 1988; lund and
lund 1995) that the putative reactive 3-meso2–dde
metabolite is inactivated by gsh conjugation in the adrenal
cortex. unlike 3-meso2–dde, o,p⬘-ddd is metabolised
on the side chain carbon into a reactive acyl chloride (gold
and brunk 1982) that binds irreversibly in the adrenal cortex in sensitive species such as humans and mink (martz

799

and straw 1980; jönsson et al. 1993; cai et al. 1995;
lindhe et al. 2002). as can be concluded from the
unchanged binding of o,p⬘-ddd in gsh-depleted y-1
cells, a reactive o,p⬘-ddd intermediate was not detoxiwed
by gsh conjugation.
the potent  xxxg571xxx  inhibitor etomidate (dörr et al.
1984; varga et al. 1993) decreased the binding of 3-meso2–
dde to 20% of the control, supporting that mainly
 xxxg571xxx  was responsible for the bioactivation in y-1 cells.
notably, etomidate extensively inhibited the binding of o,p⬘ddd as well. ketoconazole is an evective inhibitor of several steroidogenic cyps, especially  xxxg571xxx  and cyp17a
(couch et al. 1987; johansson et al. 1998). the binding of
both test compounds to y-1 cell protein was evectively
inhibited by ketoconazole. the inhibition was particularly
evective for o,p⬘-ddd where the remaining binding after
ketoconazole addition was as low as 7% of the binding in the
control.  xxxd2633xxx , considered as a speciwc  xxxg571xxx 
inhibitor at low concentrations but an unspeciwc cyp-inhibitor at high concentrations (lamberts et al. 1987), decreased
the binding of 3-meso2–dde to y-1 only slightly in this
study. addition of 100 m  xxxd2633xxx  inhibited the binding
to about 47% of the control, in line with previous wndings,
but less than shown earlier (jönsson et al. 1991; lindhe et al.
2001). it is notable that 100 m  xxxd2633xxx  had no signiwcant evect on o,p⬘-ddd binding in y-1 cells.
both the bioactivation of 3-meso2–dde by  xxxg571xxx 
and the adrenal toxicity appear to be very structure-speciwc.
in mice in vivo, we investigated seven newly synthesised
compounds with similar chemical structure to 3-meso2–dde
and none of them gave rise to any toxicity that could be
revealed using light microscopy. this could be due to several
reasons: (1) they are not toxic to the mouse adrenal cortex,
(2) they are toxic but are less potent than 3-meso2–dde,
meaning that possibly a higher dose or a longer exposure
time could cause toxicity, (3) they have poor bioavailability
and do not reach the adrenal gland. we also tested the
capacity of the structural analogues to inxuence the irreversible binding of 3-meso2–dde in y-1 cells, possibly
by competing for the binding site of  xxxg571xxx . added
in equimolar concentration as 3-meso2–dde, only two
analogues, 3-meso2–o,p⬘-dde and 2-meso2–dde, could
signiwcantly decrease the irreversible binding of 3-meso2–
dde to y-1 cells, supporting a structure-dependent competition for the active site of  xxxg571xxx . 3-meso2–o,p⬘-dde
and 2-meso2–dde might be interacting antagonistically
with  xxxg571xxx , blocking the bioactivation of 3-meso2–dde.
in our experiments, the analogues 3-meso2–dde and
2-meso2–dde show a clear discrepancy in adrenal toxicity and ability to interact with the  xxxg571xxx  binding site.
this is an additional example that small diverences in
chemical structure can signiwcantly alter the metabolism
and toxicity of substances (bahrami et al. 1999).

in conclusion, we have reproduced the in vivo irreversible binding of 3-meso2–dde to the mouse adrenal cortex
in the murine adrenocortical y-1 cell line in vitro and veriwed it with various cyp-inhibitors. surprisingly, despite
the lack of irreversible binding and toxicity of o,p⬘-ddd in
the adrenal cortex of mice in vivo, o,p⬘-ddd was irreversibly bound in y-1 proteins as well. this in vitro/in vivo discrepancy emphasises that extrapolation of quantitative
in vitro data to predict irreversible binding and toxicity
in vivo should be done with caution. nevertheless, the
results from this study demonstrate that the y-1 cell line
bioactivates the substances and should be a useful tool to
determine mechanisms of action in vitro.
