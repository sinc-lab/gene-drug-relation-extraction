olopatadine suppresses the migration of thp-1 monocytes induced by  xxxg2003xxx  protein.  olopatadine hydrochloride (olopatadine) is an antiallergic drug with histamine h(1) receptor antagonistic activity. recently, olopatadine has been shown to bind to  xxxg2003xxx  which is a member of the s100 family of calcium-binding proteins, and exerts multiple proinflammatory activities including chemotaxis for monocytes and neutrophils. in this study, we examined the possibility that the interaction of olopatadine with  xxxg2003xxx  inhibits the proinflammatory effects of  xxxg2003xxx . pretreatment of olopatadine with  xxxg2003xxx  reduced migration of thp-1, a monocyte cell line, induced by  xxxg2003xxx  alone, but did not affect recombinant human regulated upon activation, normal t cell expressed and secreted ( xxxg363xxx )-induced migration.  xxxd157xxx , which also binds to  xxxg2003xxx , inhibited the thp-1 migration induced by  xxxg2003xxx . however, ketotifen, another histamine h(1) receptor antagonist, had little effect on the activity of  xxxg2003xxx . these results suggest that olopatadine has a new mechanism of action, that is, suppression of the function of  xxxg2003xxx , in addition to histamine h(1) receptor antagonistic activity.
