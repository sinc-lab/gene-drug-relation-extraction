high affinity inhibition of ca2+-dependent
k+ channels by
cytochrome p-450 inhibitors*

the ca2+-dependentk+ channel of human  xxxd187xxx 
was inhibited with high affinity by several imidazole
antimycotics which are potent inhibitors of cytochrome
p-450.
values were
(in
mm):  xxxd1732xxx , 0.05;
 xxxd3380xxx , 0.3;  xxxd2640xxx , 1.5; econazole, 1.8. inhibition of the channel was also found with other drugs
with known cytochrome p-450 inhibitory effect. however, no inhibition was obtained with carbon monoxide
(co). this suggests that, given the high selectivity of
the above inhibitors for the heme moiety, a different
but closely related to cytochrome p-450 kind of hemoprotein may be involved in the regulation of the red
cell ca2+-dependentk+ channel.  xxxd1732xxx  also inhibited two other charybdotoxin-sensitive ca2+-dependent k+ channels, those of rat thymocytes (icso =
0.1-0.2 mm) and of ehrlich ascites tumor cells ( g o =
0.5 mm). imidazole antimycotics inhibit also receptoroperated ca2+channels (montero, m., alvarez, j. and
garcia-sancho, j. (1991) biochem. j. 277, 73-79).
this suggests that both ca2+ and ca2+-dependentk+
channels might have a similar regulatory mechanism
involving a cytochrome.

we have also reported before that the ca2+-dependentk+
channels of human  xxxd187xxx  (12-14), rat thymocytes (15), and
ehrlich ascites tumor cells (16) are regulated by the redox
state of a membrane component with an apparent standard
redox potential of about 50 mv (13). regulation of a different
k+ channel by an hemoprotein has also been proposed recently in the carotid body chemoreceptor cells (17).
in thispaper we find apotent inhibition of ca2+-dependent
k+ channels by imidazole antimycotics and othercytochrome
p-450 inhibitors. these findings further support the involvement of a cytochrome in the regulation of ca2+-dependentk+
channels and evidence striking similaritieswith the regulation
of receptor-operated ca2+ channels.
materialsandmethods

ca2+-dependent k’ channels were activated in all the
cases by
increasing the cytoplasmic free calcium concentration ([ca2+],)’by
incubation of the cells with ca” and a divalent cation ionophore.
either a23187 or  xxxd2379xxx  were used, and their concentrations
were
adjusted togive maximal activation of the channels.
in the human erythrocyte, the activity of the channels was estimated either from the net loss of k’ from cells incubated in low k+
medium (using the light scattering proceduredescribed below) or
from the uptake of 42k, measured under equilibrium exchange conditions (18).for light scattering measurements(19),washed  xxxd187xxx

fig. 4 shows the effects of  xxxd1732xxx  on caz+-dependent
k' transport in ehrlich ascites tumorcells, measured by the
light scattering technique (24, see also "materials and methods"). in the ehrlich cell addition of  xxxd2379xxx  induces a
transient increase in [ca"], which produces a simultaneous
activation of ca2+-dependentk+ and c1- channels, leading to
cell shrinkage by kc1loss (16,33,34). under these conditions,
the c1- permeability appears to be increased more than the
k' permeability (33,34) and, therefore, the rateof cell shrinkage is limited by the k+ permeability. the cell shrinkage
induced by  xxxd2379xxx  is fast (see curue labeled control), and
is followed in less than 1 min by a slower return to theinitial
volume by activation of a na'/cl- cotransport system (3335).  xxxd1732xxx  produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the shrinkage induced by  xxxd2379xxx  with an ic50
value of about 0.5 p ~ the

inhibitory effect of the peptidic
toxin charybdotoxin is also shown in the figure for comparison
purposes.

in addition to imidazole antimycotics, many other cytochrome p-450 inhibitors were able to block ca2+-dependent
k+ channels with reasonable affinity (tables i and 11).however, we did not find inhibition by co, suggesting that the
mediator involved in the control of the channel may be not a
cytochrome p-450 but a closely related hemoprotein. although cytochrome p-450 has not been detected previously in
human  xxxd187xxx  (46,47), it hasbeen reported that oxyhemoglobin can act similarly, exhibiting anilinehydroxylase activity and other similarities with cytochrome p-450 in the presence of nadph (48, 49). however, the involvement of hemoglobin in the  xxxd1732xxx -sensitive activation of human
 xxxd187xxx  ca2'-dependent k' channels is not likely because (i)
hemoglobin has a high affinity forco and co does not inhibit
the channels, and (ii) the hemoglobin concentration in our
experiments is about 3 orders of magnitude above the icso of
 xxxd1732xxx . other components analogous to themicrosomal
electron transport system have been found in  xxxd187xxx . cytochrome p-420, usually regarded as a protease degradation

thatthere

by other means, in several cell lines. in those cases co was

for each kind of channel and suggests that a study of closely
related structures could lead to find a very specific inhibitor
for either ca2+or ca2+-dependentk' channels. on the other
hand, in spite of these differences, the fact that both kinds of
channels can be inhibited by cytochrome ligands suggests a
surprising similarity in their structure orin their mechanism
of activation. this similarity is reminiscent of the close structural homology recently found between ca", k', and na'
channels (61).
