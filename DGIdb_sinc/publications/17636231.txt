the authors previously reported a case of decreased  xxxg248xxx  activity in a patient with
hellp syndrome. it was assumed that the reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity in hellp syndrome
is associated with impaired liver function. the present study assesses the prevalence of low  xxxg248xxx  in patients with hellp syndrome. serum  xxxg248xxx  activity was determined
with spectrophotometer in 15 patients with hellp syndrome. two control groups matched for gestational age were recruited: 15 healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancy and 15 women with severe
preeclampsia without hellp. the prevalence of reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity lower than normal limit was 60.0% (9/15) in patients with hellp syndrome, 33.3% (5/15) in patients with
severe preeclampsia, and 6.6% (1/15) in women with normal pregnancy, respectively ( p = .009). the
 xxxg248xxx  activity was found to correlate with serum  xxxg941xxx  levels (r = 0.417,
p = .006) and with serum aspartate aminotransferase levels (r = 0.462, p = .002). considering the
increased prevalence of reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity in patients with hellp syndrome, the
authors suggest that whenever general anesthesia is applied in these patients, the anesthesiologist should
be aware that the patient may show slow metabolic degradation of choline-ester drugs.

seudocholinesterase, a plasma enzyme first identified
in 1932,1 has no known apparent physiologic function.2 its deficiency results in abnormally slow
metabolic degradation of exogenous choline-ester drugs
such as succinylcholine.3 this condition is usually clinically recognized when paralysis of the respiratory and
other skeletal muscles fails to spontaneously recover following the administration of choline-ester drugs during
general anesthesia.  xxxg248xxx  deficiency is

either inherited or acquired by a variety of pathologic
conditions, diseases, or medications.3,4
recently, we described a case with reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity associated with hellp syndrome.5
the acronym hellp was coined in 1982 by weinstein,
and it describes a unique association of hemolysis, elevated
liver enzymes, and a low platelet count with preeclampsia.6 in our earlier study, we suggested that the observed
reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity resulted from liver
dysfunction,5 similarly to previously reported low  xxxg248xxx  activity in other liver diseases.7-9  xxxg248xxx  activity returned to normal along with the
improvement in the other liver laboratory abnormalities
associated with hellp syndrome.5
this observation of the changes in  xxxg248xxx  activity5 stimulated us to assess the prevalence of this phenomenon in a series of patients with
hellp syndrome. the extent of this deficiency is of
particular importance whenever such patients are selected
for general anesthesia.

patients and methods
study design
the study protocol was approved by both the edith wolfson
medical center institutional review board and the
rabin medical center institutional review board. the
inclusion criterion for the study group was the presence
of hellp syndrome. hellp syndrome was defined as
preeclampsia (sustained blood pressure of more than
140/90 mm hg and proteinuria of more than 300 mg on
24-hour urine collection), elevated serum transaminases
(aspartate aminotransferase [ast] level more than 31
u/l and  xxxg941xxx  [alt] level more than
31 u/l), and platelet count of less than 100 000 µ/l.
all patients with hellp syndrome were prospectively
included during the study period of 36 months.two control groups were matched for gestational age (±1 week).
the first group consisted of women with uncomplicated
pregnancy without signs and symptoms of preeclampsia
or gestational hypertension who delivered within 1 week
of patients in the study group.the second control group
consisted of patients with severe preeclampsia without
signs of hellp. severe preeclampsia was defined as sustained blood pressure of more than 160/110 mm hg and
proteinuria of more than 2 g on 24-hour urine collection. blood for determination of liver enzymes, platelet
count, and  xxxg248xxx  activity was taken on
admission. at the time of the blood withdrawal, patients
were not given any medication.
the following assumptions were made in calculating
the sample size: the incidence of hellp is 0.2% to 0.9% of
all live births,10 6% of patients in most surgical populations
have an abnormally low  xxxg248xxx  activity,3 and
the estimated prevalence of  xxxg248xxx  deficiency

in patients with hellp syndrome is 50%. thus, with a
2-sided alpha of .05 and 80% power, 15 participants were
required in each of the 3 groups described above.
participants. the 45 study participants were consecutively
recruited from edith wolfson medical center and rabin
medical center. both centers are university-affiliated,
tertiary-care facilities located in central israel about 30 km
apart from each other. the study group consisted of 15
women in the hellp group (13 delivered in edith
wolfson medical center and 2 delivered in rabin medical
center). the first control group consisted of 15 healthy
women with uncomplicated pregnancy (13 delivered in the
edith wolfson medical center and 2 delivered in the rabin
medical center). the second control group consisted of
15 women with preeclampsia without hellp (all 15 delivered in rabin medical center). none of the women had a
pre-existing liver disease, and all were generally healthy
prior to pregnancy.the demographic characteristics of the
study participants are summarized in table 1.
determination of  xxxg248xxx  activity. serum  xxxg248xxx  activity was determined with spectrophotometer. cholinesterase catalyzes hydrolysis of butyrthiocholine
to butyrate and thiocholine. thiocholine reduces yellow
hexacyanoferrate (iii) to colorless hexacyanoferrate (ii).
the decrease in absorption at 410 nm is directly proportional to cholinesterase activity in the sample.the lower
limit of normal  xxxg248xxx  activity was established with accordance to manufacturer guidelines after
routine validation in our laboratory and set as 4600 u/l.
validation of this reference value was done by measuring
 xxxg248xxx  in 50 healthy women of reproductive age. this reference value is similar to that recommended by tietz’s clinical guide to laboratory tests.11

statistical analysis. analysis of data was carried out using
spss statistical analysis software (spss inc, chicago, ill).
the distribution of variables was tested for normalcy using
the kolmogorov-smirnov test.all variables were normally
distributed and compared using the student t test. normally
distributed continuous variables were compared by delivery
type using the 1-way analysis of variance. nominal variables
were compared using chi2 tests. associations between variables were described using pearson correlation analysis.all
tests were 2 sided and considered significant at p < .05.

results
as expected, the groups were not different in age, gestational week, or parity. patients with hellp syndrome
had significantly elevated liver enzymes and lower platelet
count as compared to patients with severe preeclampsia
or to women with normal pregnancy (see table 1).
the prevalence of reduced  xxxg248xxx 
activity below normal limit was 60.0% (9/15) in patients
with hellp syndrome, 33.3% (5/15) in patients with
severe preeclampsia, and 6.6% (1/15) in women with
normal pregnancy, respectively (p = .009).the prevalence
of reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity below the normal limit was significantly higher in patients with hellp
syndrome compared to women with normal pregnancy
(p = .002). the  xxxg248xxx  activity was found
to correlate with serum alt levels (r = 0.417, p = .006;
figure 1) and with serum ast levels (r = 0.462, p = .002;
figure 2) but not with platelet count (r = 0.25, p = .1) or
gestational week (r = 0.081, p = .6).
none of the patients with low  xxxg248xxx 
activity needed general anesthesia during the labor and
delivery, and therefore, no complications associated with
the anesthesia were noted during the study.

discussion
we found that the prevalence of reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity below the normal limit was significantly higher in patients with hellp syndrome (60%) as
compared to women with normal pregnancy matched for
gestational age (6.6%; p = .002).this apparently acquired
deficiency is important because slightly prolonged apnea
following succinylcholine administration may occur when
 xxxg248xxx  activity is about 75% of the lower
limit and becomes significantly prolonged when  xxxg248xxx  activity is about 30% of the lower limit.12

figure 2. scatter plot showing the correlation between  xxxg248xxx  (pche) and aspartate aminotransferase (ast).

taking into account its increased prevalence, the potentially reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity becomes particularly important when choosing general anesthesia for
obstetric indications such as cesarean delivery or revision
of the uterine cavity in women with antepartum hellp
syndrome. regional anesthesia for cesarean delivery may
be indicated in the presence of  xxxg248xxx  deficiency in women with hellp syndrome. the use of
regional anesthesia in women with hellp syndrome
may be especially safe with preceding administration of corticosteroid therapy.13 this, however, should be weighed
against the risk of the formation of an epidural hematoma
in the presence of concomitant thrombocytopenia or
thrombosthenia observed in severe preeclampsia and hellp
syndrome. still, in cases in which general anesthesia is
required in a patient with hellp syndrome, the anesthesiologist should be aware that the patient may show slow
metabolic degradation of choline-ester drugs.

 xxxg248xxx  in hellp syndrome

reproductive sciences vol. 14, no. 2, february 2007 195

we consider that the cause of reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity in hellp syndrome is liver damage.
since  xxxg248xxx  is biosynthesized in the liver,14
significant deterioration in liver function may impair its
production.15 the synthesis of  xxxg248xxx  is
dependent not only on the hepatocytes but also on the
function of the golgi apparatus.the latter might be more
important in the etiology of reduced  xxxg248xxx 
activity in patients with hellp syndrome. similarly to
hellp syndrome, other significant liver diseases are also
associated with reduced plasma  xxxg248xxx  activity.7-9 improvement in liver function is concomitant with an
increase in  xxxg248xxx  activity.5,15,16 the assumption that liver damage is the explanation for reduced
 xxxg248xxx  activity in patients with hellp
syndrome is further supported by findings of a positive
correlation between  xxxg248xxx  activity and
transaminases (p < .01). the power of this association is
nevertheless limited because there is difficulty in establishing causality based solely on positive correlation. we have
found that the prevalence of reduced  xxxg248xxx 
activity is higher not only in patients with hellp syndrome but also in patients with severe preeclampsia, though
to a lesser extent (33.3% compared to 60% in hellp).this
finding supports the view that severe preeclampsia and
hellp syndrome are part of the same spectrum of disease
and have a common etiology.17 hepatocellular injury is
often present in severe preeclampsia,17 yet this is not always
evident from liver function analysis.
previous studies showed a mild decrease in  xxxg248xxx  activity during pregnancy.18-20 the reason
for this decrease is not entirely elucidated.2 it is thought
that it might be associated with a hormonal action on
hepatic synthesis that is peculiar to pregnancy.2 the low
prevalence of reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity below
the lower normal limit in our control group of healthy
women with uncomplicated pregnancy (6.6%) was not
different from that expected in the general population.3
in any case, the formation of this control group, matched for
gestational age, eliminated possible bias with regard to a
previously reported mild decrease in  xxxg248xxx 
activity during normal pregnancy.
in summary, we have shown a considerably increased
prevalence of reduced  xxxg248xxx  activity in
patients with hellp syndrome and to a lesser extent
in severe preeclampsia.therefore, we suggest that whenever general anesthesia is applied in these patients, laboratory evaluation of  xxxg248xxx  activity should

be considered, and special attention is needed by the
anesthesiologist in this respect. the option of regional
anesthesia should be alternatively considered.
