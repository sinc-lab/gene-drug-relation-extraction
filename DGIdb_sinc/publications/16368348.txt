background. the radial artery is increasingly being
used in coronary revascularization as an alternative conduit to a saphenous vein graft. its perfect endothelial
capacity provides a high patency rate comparable with
the internal mammary artery (ima). however, its spastic
characteristics cause difficulties during its intraoperative
preparation and may lead to early postoperative graft
failure. thus, treatment and/or prevention of radial artery spasm with an effective vasodilator agent is essential
for its longevity. endogenous vasoconstrictors, including
noradrenaline,  xxxg674xxx , and thromboxane a2, are
likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of graft spasm. in
the present study, we evaluated the vasorelaxant effect of
 xxxd3393xxx , a nonselective alpha-adrenoceptor blocker,
against the contractions induced by various spasmogenic
agents in an isolated human radial artery.
methods.  xxxd3393xxx  (10ⴚ9–10ⴚ4 m) or sodium nitroprusside (snp, 10ⴚ9–10ⴚ4 m) were cumulatively applied
on radial artery rings precontracted submaximally with

noradrenaline,  xxxg674xxx , thromboxane analogue,
u46619, or  xxxd2988xxx . in addition, some rings
were pretreated with  xxxd3393xxx  (4 ⴛ 10ⴚ6 m) for 30
minutes and the contractile response curve to noradrenaline was assessed in its presence.
results.  xxxd3393xxx  effectively reversed noradrenalineinduced contractions in the radial artery, whereas it
failed to produce remarkable relaxations on rings contracted with other spasmogenic agents, while snp overcame the contractions induced by all spasmogens to a
similar extent. in addition, brief pretreatment of radial
artery rings with  xxxd3393xxx  significantly inhibited the
contractions to noradrenaline.
conclusions.  xxxd3393xxx  is not as broadly effective as
snp against all spasmogens investigated; however, it
may be effective in counteracting alpha-adrenoceptormediated vasospasm in human radial arteries.

man radial artery [5], and stronger contractions were
obtained in response to alpha-receptor agonists compared with the internal mammary artery (ima) [6, 7].
hence, circulating catecholamines and exogenous sympathomimetics may profoundly predispose radial artery
spasm during the perioperative and early postoperative
periods. use of an optimal vasodilator is important in
order to counteract radial artery spasm and improve its
longevity. however, occasional lack of efficiency of currently used vasodilators and their side effects limiting
their usage stimulate the search for alternative vasodilator agents against this vasospasm [8].
 xxxd3393xxx  is a competitive, nonselective alphaadrenergic receptor blocker used in persistent pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypertension of the newborn,
due to its selective vasodilator activity on the pulmonary
vascular bed [9, 10]. vasodilator effect of  xxxd3393xxx  is also
demonstrated in traumatic arterial spasm; its intraarterial
administration prevents stasis and thrombosis in the
damaged area by increasing local blood flow [11]. similarly, it was found effective against local arterial vasospasm due to catheterization in the newborn [12]. a
recent study reported an excellent vasodilator effect in
forearm and hand arteries as well as an improvement in

he radial artery was introduced as a conduit in
coronary artery bypass operations by carpentier
and colleagues in the early 1970s [1]. however, its usage
was abandoned shortly after because of its tendency for
spasm leading to low patency rates [2]. increasing interest in total arterial revascularization, due to the high
obstruction rates with saphenous vein grafts and the
development of new techniques for prevention or treatment of vasospasm, revived the use of the radial artery as
a graft material [3].
endogenous vasoconstrictors are among various stimuli likely to evoke graft spasm. plasma levels of various
spasmogens, including noradrenaline,  xxxg674xxx ,
thromboxane a2, and  xxxg99xxx  have been reported
to be elevated during cardiopulmonary bypass [4]. propensity to spasm is an important issue during harvesting
of the artery, and for the management of myocardial
perfusion by the use of a vasoconstrictor, particularly a
sympathomimetic agent [3]. previous studies have shown
a dominant alpha-adrenergic receptor activity in a huaccepted for publication july 6, 2005.

glucose 10.1, and disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid 0.026.
adherent connective tissues were removed and specimen was cut into rings of 3 to 4 mm in length. rings were
suspended between two stainless steel l-shaped hooks
in a 10 ml jacketed organ bath containing krebs-ringer
bicarbonate solution at 37°c and aerated with 95% o2
and 5% co2. one hook was fixed at the bottom of the
organ bath while the other was connected to a force
displacement transducer (grass model ft03; grass telefactor, west warwick, ri), which was fixed to a micrometric manipulator allowing adjustments in the resting
tension of the rings. the optimal point of length-tension
relation had been determined in our preliminary experiments by repeated exposure to noradrenaline (5 ⫻ 10⫺5
m) at different levels of resting tension. four grams
provided maximal noradrenaline responsiveness in radial arteries and this was used as the resting tension. two
to three rings were obtained from each artery specimen.

experimental protocol
blood flow after intraarterial administration of  xxxd3393xxx 
during angiography of the hand [13]. in vitro studies
demonstrating the vasorelaxant effect of  xxxd3393xxx  also
supports its effectiveness against increased vascular tone
[14, 15]. however, we have found no published report on
the use of  xxxd3393xxx  to overcome arterial graft spasm.
in the present study, we aimed to investigate the
antispasmodic effect of the nonselective alphaadrenoreceptor antagonist  xxxd3393xxx  against contractions induced by various spasmogenic agents in isolated
human radial artery rings, in comparison with a nitrovasodilator, sodium nitroprusside (snp). the contractile
responsiveness of radial artery rings to noradrenaline
after a brief exposure to  xxxd3393xxx  was also assessed.

material and methods
sampling and preparation of radial artery
radial artery samples were obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass operations. due to the
limitations of graft length, only the patients in which
radial artery grafts were to be used to bypass the first
marginal branch of circumflex or intermediate coronary
arteries (ramus intermedius) were enrolled. use of discarded human radial artery segments was approved by
the institutional review board of siyami ersek education
and research hospital (march 8, 2003). informed consent
was obtained from all candidate patients prior to operation. clinical characteristics of the patients are given in
table 1.
caution was exercised during harvesting of the vessel
in order not to stretch and touch the endothelial surface.
the sampled segment of radial artery, which is not
exposed to any preparatory solution, was placed into cold
(4°c) krebs-ringer bicarbonate solution, then immedi-

after the equilibration period of 2 hours, viabilities of the
vessel segments were checked by  xxxd2988xxx  (40
mm) and preparations that produced a tension of less
than 3 g were discarded. two consecutive potassium
chloride responses were obtained for each ring in order
to standardize the reactivity of the preparations. all
experiments were carried on endothelium intact rings of
the radial artery, and the presence of endothelium was
confirmed by functional relaxation of noradrenaline precontracted arteries in response to 10⫺5 m acetylcholine
(92.51 ⫾ 3.84%, n ⫽ 22).
experiments were performed to evaluate the antispasmodic effect of  xxxd3393xxx  against various spasmogenic
agents; namely, noradrenaline,  xxxg674xxx , thromboxane analogue u46619, and  xxxd2988xxx , in comparison with sodium nitroprusside (snp). for each agent,
the concentration required to produce a similar contractile force (g) in radial artery graft was determined and
this concentration was used for submaximal (60% to 80%)
contraction. vessel rings were contracted submaximally
with noradrenaline (3 ⫻ 10⫺6–10⫺5 m),  xxxg674xxx 
(10⫺8 m), u-46619 (3 ⫻ 10⫺8 m), and  xxxd2988xxx 
(20 –30 mm). then, increasing concentrations of  xxxd3393xxx  (10⫺9–10⫺4 m) and snp (10⫺9–10⫺4 m) were applied
on radial artery rings precontracted with one of the
contractile agents. at the end of each experiment, relaxation capacities of radial artery rings were tested with
snp, which was applied at maximal concentration (10⫺4
m). in parallel control experiments, the contractions
induced by the spasmogenic agents were found stable
enough for the period required to construct the cumulative-relaxation curves for  xxxd3393xxx  and snp.
the preventive effect of  xxxd3393xxx  against noradrenaline-induced contractions was also evaluated. in these
experiments, the cumulative concentration-response
curves to noradrenaline (10⫺8–10⫺4 m) were obtained for

reactivity to spasmogens

the radial artery is increasingly being used in coronary
revascularization since its revival over the last 10 years.
angiographic studies and randomized trials clearly demonstrated that it has an excellent long-term patency rate
superior to the saphenous vein and similar to the ima
[16, 17]. this advancing profile ultimately proposes the
radial artery as a second conduit of choice after the ima
as well as an alternative to the saphenous vein. unfortunately, spasm of the radial artery during harvesting and
early postoperative period is a well-known phenomenon.
its greater tendency to spasm than the ima is probably
related to its muscular nature [18] and high reactivity to
vasospastic agents [6, 7, 19]. in contrast, endothelial and
vascular relaxation properties of the radial artery were
found comparable to the ima [19, 20].
the relief of vasospasm by using an appropriate vasodilator is important for the maintenance of early as well
as long-term patency of the radial artery graft. in addition, a prosperous opposition of graft spasm during
preparation is recommended in order to prevent the
genesis of additional spasms in the perioperative and
postoperative periods [21]. various vasodilators acting by
different mechanisms have been introduced for the management of radial artery spasm. however, all have some
limitations, such as slow onset [21] and short duration
[22, 23] of action, development of tolerance [24], possibility of endothelial damage [23, 25], variation of efficacy
depending on the timing of application [26], sensitization
to vasoconstrictors [27], low efficiency [28, 29], and hypotension [29, 30]. thus, current vasodilators might be
unsatisfactory in some circumstances and it is reasonable
to consider alternative agents for the reversal or prevention of this vasospasm.
elevated circulating levels of endogenous vasoconstrictors, including catecholamines, possibly play a role
in the spasm of the radial artery. in addition, the risk of
spasm is further increased when a vasoconstrictor substance, particularly a sympathomimetic agent, is used for
the restoration of normal blood pressure and myocardial
perfusion in patients who became hypotensive after
extensive grafting [8]. previous in vitro studies demonstrated that the radial artery has dominant alphaadrenergic receptor activity [5] and displays stronger
reactivity preferentially to noradrenaline as well as other

noradrenaline,  xxxg674xxx , u46619, and potassium
chloride produced concentration-dependent contractions
in radial artery rings (fig 1). the maximal contractile
forces induced by these spasmogens were comparable
(emax: noradrenaline, 10.08 ⫾ 0.92 g;  xxxg674xxx , 10.67
⫾ 2.12 g; u46619, 13.62 ⫾ 2.10 g;  xxxd2988xxx , 11.29
⫾ 2.19 g, n ⫽ 6 –9, p ⬎ 0.05), whereas vessels were more
sensitive to  xxxg674xxx  and u46619 than noradrenaline
and  xxxd2988xxx  (ec50:  xxxg674xxx , 8.31 ⫾ 0.21;
u46619, 7.79 ⫾ 0.12; p ⬍ 0.001 vs noradrenaline, 5.78 ⫾
0.15; and  xxxd2988xxx , 1.82 ⫾ 0.09).

relaxations in response to  xxxd3393xxx  and snp
 xxxd3393xxx  produced concentration-dependent relaxations on isolated radial arteries contracted with noradrenaline (fig 2). however, very weak relaxant responses were observed in rings precontracted with
 xxxg674xxx  (11.69 ⫾ 5.65%, n ⫽ 9), u46619 (8.56 ⫾ 4.1%,
n ⫽ 6), and  xxxd2988xxx  (6.39 ⫾ 2.73%, n ⫽ 6). the
precontraction forces elicited by spasmogenic agents
were similar (noradrenaline, 6.15 ⫾ 0.94 g;  xxxg674xxx ,
6.25 ⫾ 0.72 g; u46619, 6.30 ⫾ 0.29 g,  xxxd2988xxx ,
6.03 ⫾ 0.70 g; n ⫽ 6 –9, p ⬎ 0.05). on the other hand, snp
resulted in complete relaxations of radial artery rings
precontracted with either of the contractile agents (fig 2).
in noradrenaline contracted rings, the maximal relaxation and the sensitivity to  xxxd3393xxx  (emax: 91.18 ⫾
5.11%; ec50: 5.40 ⫾ 0.14, n ⫽ 9) were close to, but
significantly lower than that of snp (emax: 121.92 ⫾
3.84%; ec50: 6.87 ⫾ 0.09, n ⫽ 9, p ⬍ 0.001 vs  xxxd3393xxx ).

noradrenaline contractions after  xxxd3393xxx 
pretreatment
noradrenaline resulted in concentration-dependent contractions of radial artery rings. pretreatment of the artery
rings with  xxxd3393xxx  (4 ⫻ 10⫺6 m) for a brief period
significantly decreased the maximal contraction and the
sensitivity to noradrenaline (pretreated rings: emax: 8.88
⫾ 2.29 g; ec50: 4.91 ⫾ 0.15, n ⫽ 4 vs control rings: emax:
11.15 ⫾ 2.14 g, p ⬍ 0.05; ec50: 5.39 ⫾ 0.14, n ⫽ 4, p ⬍ 0.05).
whereas in parallel control experiments, two consecutive
cumulative contractions to noradrenaline were similar
(fig 3).

vasoconstrictors compared with the ima [6, 7, 19].
among them,  xxxg674xxx , thromboxane a2, and noradrenaline are classified as type i vasoconstrictors with
high potency and strong contractile effects on human
arteries, even in the presence of an intact endothelium
[31]. in the present study, we observed profound contractions in radial artery rings in response to these spasmogens, with a higher sensitivity to  xxxg674xxx  and
thromboxane analogue than noradrenaline.
although mainly its greater wall thickness accounts for
the high responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, the preparation of the radial artery as a free graft may also contribute
to the tendency for vasospasm. likewise, it has been
reported that denervation increases the expression of
alpha-adrenoceptors in grafted vessels [32]. thus, catecholamines and sympathomimetics may play a precise
role in the development of radial artery spasm. recently,
phenoxybenzamine, an irreversible alpha-adrenoceptor
antagonist, was reported as an effective and long acting
antispasmodic agent for the prevention of radial artery
vasospasm mediated by alpha-adrenergic stimuli [33].
this agent was suggested to have advantages over currently used vasodilators, such as having no harmful
effects on endothelium in contrast to papaverine even at
a high concentration and after a long exposure period
[23]. besides, a brief pretreatment with phenoxybenzamine was found highly effective in preventing contractions in response to alpha-adrenergic agonists in the
radial artery, unlike papaverine which failed to attenuate
the constriction responses [34] or produced relatively
short-lived protective effects than phenoxybenzamine
[22, 35]. however, it is not known whether the prolonged
inhibitory effect of phenoxybenzamine on vascular reactivity may cause a problem in the clinical setting either by
producing a refractory state to supportive vasopressor
treatment after operation or by enhancing contractile
reactivity to other possible spasmogens.
there are several reports evaluating the prevention as
well as the reversal of the contractile tone in the arterial
grafts by commonly used vasodilators [26, 36, 37]. previous in vitro studies demonstrated that vasodilators may
have different effectiveness on the reactivity of an arterial
graft depending on the timing of their exposure, either
before or after the contractile stimulus. this has been
documented for  xxxd2741xxx  [37] and milrinone
[26]. both of these agents were found to be more effective
in reversing an already established contraction than
preventing the generation of a contraction. although the
preventive effect of phenoxybenzamine in radial artery
spasm has been demonstrated, the efficacy of alphaadrenergic antagonists in reversing an established contraction has not, to our knowledge, been reported so far.
in the present study we demonstrated that competitive
alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3393xxx  is effective in
reversing radial artery spasm induced by noradrenaline
under in vitro conditions. increasing concentrations of
 xxxd3393xxx  almost fully overcame the contractions induced by noradrenaline in radial artery rings, however
only weakly inhibited the contractions produced by other
potential spasmogens namely,  xxxg674xxx , thrombox-

ane a2 analogue, u46619, and  xxxd2988xxx . current findings reinforce previous results of phenoxybenzamine pretreatment. in that study, phenoxybenzamine
prevented the contractions induced by alpha-adrenergic
agonists but it failed to inhibit contractions in response to
other vasoconstrictor agents [35]. our results suggest that
 xxxd3393xxx  can effectively reverse vasospasm mediated by
alpha-adrenergic activity in the radial artery graft. on the
other hand, snp was found effective in reversing both
receptor and depolarizing agent-mediated contractions.
in fact, nitrovasodilators are known as effective agents in
reversing radial artery spasm regardless of the nature of
the constrictor stimulus [6, 24]. in our study, the maximal
responsiveness and the sensitivity of the radial artery to
snp were found somewhat higher than to  xxxd3393xxx .
additionally, pretreatment of radial artery rings with
 xxxd3393xxx  for a brief period significantly decreased the
contractions to noradrenaline. in contrary with phenoxybenzamine, which fully depressed the responses to alpha-adrenoceptor agonists [23, 33, 34, 35], we found that
 xxxd3393xxx  remarkably but incompletely inhibited the
contractions induced by noradrenaline. this difference in
efficacy pattern between  xxxd3393xxx  and phenoxybenzamine may be due to differences in receptor interaction
and concentrations applied. in the present study, the
duration of the inhibition of contractile response to
noradrenaline was not assessed in  xxxd3393xxx  pretreated
radial artery rings. much shorter duration of action than
that of phenoxybenzamine may be expected for  xxxd3393xxx  due to its different interaction profile with alphaadrenoceptors, however this issue merits further investigation. it is suggested that prolonged inhibition of
alpha-adrenoceptor mediated contraction by phenoxybenzamine may provide an advantage by extending the
duration of protection against alpha-adrenergic stimuli
to the early postoperative period [22, 35]. however, this
may increase the risk for spasm by increasing the reactivity to other possible spasmogenic substances, in particular to  xxxg99xxx , because of the cross talk between receptors [38]. due to the sparsity of human tissue,
pretreatment of radial arteries with snp could not be
assessed in this study. however, a recent study clearly
demonstrated the significant attenuation of the contractile responses to  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoreceptor agonist phenylephrine in radial arteries pretreated with snp [20].
present findings suggest that  xxxd3393xxx  can be an
effective vasodilator for the relief of radial artery spasm
evoked by alpha-adrenoceptor activation. however, an
additional relaxant agent seems to be needed in order to
counteract the vasoconstriction initiated by other receptors in the graft. our results and previous observations
demonstrated that nitrovasodilators are highly effective
agents in overcoming radial artery spasm induced by an
extensive range of vasoconstrictors [20, 24, 28, 29]. the
combined topical use of nitrovasodilators with calcium
channel blockers has been established as the most appropriate strategy in overcoming radial artery vasospasm
[21, 39]. unlike nitrovasodilators, ca⫹⫹ channel blockers
are not broadly effective and have limited effects in terms
of preventing or reducing receptor-dependent contrac-

tions, including alpha-adrenoceptors, in the radial artery
[28, 29]. thus, in light of our findings,  xxxd3393xxx  may be
introduced as an alternative local vasodilator to calcium
channel blockers for use in combination with topical
nitrovasodilators against radial artery vasospasm. in due
time, this possibility needs to be exercised in clinical
practice.
on the basis of the results of this in vitro study,
 xxxd3393xxx  can be effective in the treatment as well as in
the prevention of radial artery spasm evoked by alphaadrenergic stimuli. unlike snp,  xxxd3393xxx  is not effective
against all spasmogens evaluated. however, the use of
selective receptor antagonists during the preparation of
the radial artery is an encouraging and attractive strategy
for the antispastic management of this graft. notably,
current results may provide evidence for the use of
 xxxd3393xxx  as an effective topical antispasmodic agent
during the preparation of the radial artery for grafting.
given the importance of increased sympathomimetic
activity for the development of spasm, incorporation of
alpha- adrenoceptor antagonist  xxxd3393xxx  into the vasodilator strategy may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the management of radial artery graft vasospasm.

notice from the american board of thoracic surgery
regarding trainees and candidates for certification who
are called to military service related to the war on
terrorism
the board appreciates the concern of those who have
received emergency calls to military service. they may be
assured that the board will exercise the same sympathetic
consideration as was given to candidates in recognition of
their special contributions to their country during the
vietnam conflict and the persian gulf conflict with regard
to applications, examinations, and interruption of training.
