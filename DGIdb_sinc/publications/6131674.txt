inhibition of soybean lipoxygenase by  xxxd3255xxx  and 5- xxxd153xxx : a
possible mode of action in ulcerative colitis
(received 3 may 1982; accepted 20 july 1982)

for over 30 years,  xxxd3255xxx  [1] has been the drug of
choice in the treatment of ulcerative colitis. the exact mode
of action remains unclear, but it has been hypothesized
that the action of  xxxd3255xxx  and its metabolite, 5- xxxd153xxx  ( xxxd2579xxx ), is through inhibition of colonic
mucosal prostaglandin synthesis [2,3], inhibition of
mucosal prostaglandin metabolism [4-6], innbition of
absorption of folates [7] or inhibition of dna synthesis
[8]. the apparent contradictions about the mode of action
of  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  suggest that a totally different
mode of action might be involved.
ulcerative colitis is characterized by an acute mucosal
inflammation dominated by polymorphonuclear leukocyte
accumulation by random migration [9].  xxxd3255xxx  and
 xxxd2579xxx  inhibit such random migrations, phagocytosis and
oxidative metabolism [10].
leukotrienes,
hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic
acids
(hpete), and hydroxyeicostetraenoic acids (hete) are
products of  xxxd208xxx  metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway. they have been shown to be highly potent
and stereospecific factors stimulating polymorphonuclear
leukocyte (pmnl) migration [11-14] and enhancing vascular permeability [15]. since  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx 
inhibit the migration of pmnl, it seems possible that
 xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  might be working in part through
inhibition of the lipoxygenase pathway. to test the above
hypothesis, we evaluated  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  for possible lipoxygenase inhibitor activity.
materials and methods
 xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  were tested against the lipoxygenase of  xxxd208xxx  using soybean lipoxygenase (ec
1.13.11.12) and linoleic acid as substrate.
 xxxd3255xxx  was a gift from salsbury laboratories,
charles city, ia, and  xxxd2579xxx  was obtained from the aldrich
chemical co., milwaukee, wi. soybean lipoxygenase, linoleic acid and tris were purchased from the sigma chemical
co., st. louis, mo.

determination o f lipoxygenase activity. the conversion
of linoleic acid to hydroperoxylinoleic acid was followed
spectrophotometrically by the appearance of a conjugated
diene at 234 nm. the enzymatic reaction was monitored
using a gilford model 250 spectrophotometer at 24°. each
assay had a total volume of 1 ml and contained sodium
linoleate, 100/~m; 0.1 m tris hydrochloride, ph 9.0; 2%
ethanol; 4.2%  xxxd3034xxx ; and sufficient enzyme to
give an easily measurable initial rate of reaction [16, 17].
substrate solutions were prepared fresh prior to assays with
20% ethanol in  xxxd3449xxx , and inhibitors were dissolved
in a 5.25%  xxxd3034xxx - xxxd3449xxx  solution in such
a manner that an aliquot of each yielded a final concentration of 4.2%  xxxd3034xxx  and 2% ethanol in each
assay. the effects of inhibitors on the enzymatic reaction
were compared against controls under identical conditions.
the substrate concentration used for all assays was 100 #m.
under the conditions of this assay, an ics0value of 6.1 #m
was obtained for the known lipoxygenase inhibitor,  xxxd2748xxx  ( xxxd2748xxx ). the reported ics0 values
for  xxxd2748xxx  are 2.4 to 10 gm [16, 18].
results and discussion
the inhibitory activity of  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  was
measured against soybean lipoxygenase, an enzyme source
shown to be predictive of human lipoxygenase [18]. in the
presence of  xxxd3255xxx , there was a dose-related inhibition of lipoxygenase enzyme. based upon three separate
determinations, the ics0 for  xxxd3255xxx  was found to be
66.2/~m, while  xxxd2579xxx , the metabolite of  xxxd3255xxx ,
inhibited the enzyme with an ics0 of 170/~m. a representative ic50 determination is shown in fig. 1.
 xxxd3255xxx  inhibits prostaglandin biosynthesis with an
ics0 of about 1500/2m [5], whereas  xxxd2579xxx  is weaker than
 xxxd3255xxx  [5]. while the ics0 concentrations are very
high, local or topical application of these agents such as
with enemas [19-21] might have therapeutic effect.
 xxxd3255xxx  has been shown to inhibit the breakdown

enzyme reaction was followed spectrophotometrically at room temperature, by the appearance of
conjugated diene at 234 nm. each point is the mean of at least eight determinations. the standard

50-100 #m through inhibition of prostaglandin-15hydroxydehydrogenase [5] at concentrations comparable
to that of lipoxygenase inhibition. however,  xxxd2579xxx  is
inactive as a prostaglandin-15-hydroxydehydrogenase
inhibitor [5] and must have been acting through another,
yet undefined, mechanism.
the inhibition of lipoxygenase by  xxxd3255xxx  and 5asa represents a single mechanism which could explain
the action of both agents. the estimated binding affinities
of the drug with the enzyme (k,) for  xxxd3255xxx  and 5asa are 16.6 and 42.5~tm, respectively, based on the
relation ics0/s = ki/k,, [22] where the reported k,~ for
soybean lipoxygenase is 25 um [23]. the ki values of  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  are less than the average concentration
of the drugs found in stools of  xxxd3255xxx -treated patients
(78 and 150mg/100ml, respectively) [24]. thus, the k,
values of  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx  may be at more physiologically significant concentration levels which could
explain their mode of action in ulcerative colitis better than
the previously suggested modes of action [2-7] of these two
drugs.
in summary,  xxxd3255xxx  and  xxxd2579xxx . two drugs of
choice for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, inhibited the
 xxxd208xxx -metabolizing enzyme, lipoxygenase, with
estimated k, values of 16,6 and 42.5 um respectively. since
these two drugs inhibited lipoxygenase at concentrations
lower than that needed to inhibit either pg synthetase or
prostaglandin- 15-hydroxydehydrogenase,

colitis by a single mechanism. this conclusion has just been
verified using [14c] xxxd208xxx  and purified human
neutrophils [25]. lipoxygenase inhibition in the target
organ, colon or large bowel, offers a new and rationale
approach to the design of potent drugs in the treatment of
ulcerative colitis.

effects of 1,7- and 1,10-phenanthroline dione on tissue culture cells*
(received 20 april 1982; accepted 2 august 1982)

methoxatin is a recently discovered coenzyme which functions in various bacterial nad(p)-independent alcohol,
glucose, aldehyde and, perhaps, methylamine dehydrogenases [1--4]. because of the scarcity of this coenzyme,
1,7-phenanthroline dione (1,7-pad) and 1,10-phenanthroline dione (1,10-pad) have been studied as chemical
models of methoxatin [5]. both analogs were found to
participate in diverse reactions such as 1-electron transfer,

transamination, redox reactions, and condensation with
nucleophiles. 1,10-pad also has obvious structural analogy
with ortho-phenanthroline which impairs cell proliferation
[6, 7], and both have a quinone moiety found in a number
of potentially useful anti-neoplastic agents [8-10]. indeed,
phenanthrenequinone and a number of related analogs
have been shown to be cytotoxic towards cells in culture
and to have activity in some experimental animal tumor
models [9]. with these considerations, we undertook a
study of the effects of 1,7- and 1,10-pad on cells grown
in tissue culture. a preliminary report of our findings is
described here.

1,10-pad was obtained from alfa-ventron and 1,7-pad

the ecs0 values refer to the concentration of drug which
inhibited the growth rate of cells by 50% as compared to

cloning assays of $49 cells were performed by a modfication of a reported procedure [11]. primary mouse epithelial fibroblasts were grown as monolayers in dme h21
media supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf
serum. one day prior to cloning, confluent cultures were
trypsinized, resuspended in media, and replated in
2.4 × 1.7 cm tissue culture wells at ca. 50-70% confluency
as determined microscopically. the cloning medium was
freshly prepared by adding 100 ml dme h16 medium (at
44°) containing 10% horse serum, 25mm 4-(2hydroxyethyl)-l-piperazine-ethanesulfonic acid (hepes)
buffer (ph 7.4), 100units/ml of penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml
of streptomycin to an autoclaved solution of 0.44 g agarose
in 10 ml water. the medium was kept at 44°. at least 1 hr
before use, media from primary mouse epithelial cell cultures were aspirated, and cells were overlayed with 2.0 ml
of the cloning media. plates were briefly cooled and kept
at 37° until use. $49 cells, treated as specified, were diluted
