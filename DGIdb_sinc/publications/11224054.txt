dual activation by  xxxd2498xxx  of central serotonin 5-ht(1a) and dopamine d(2) receptor sites: drug discrimination and receptor binding studies.  to investigate central serotonergic (5-ht) and dopaminergic (da) actions of  xxxd2498xxx , the discriminative properties of  xxxd2498xxx  (0.05mg/kg, i.p.) in rats were investigated, in addition to the radioligand binding of the compound to 5-ht and da receptor subtypes.  xxxd2498xxx  was found to possess high affinities for 5-ht(1a) receptor sites (ki=0.5nm) and d(2) receptor sites (ki=2.0nm). the autoradiographic binding pattern of 4nm [(3)h] xxxd2498xxx  in rat brain showed high densities of sites displaceable by the 5-ht(1a) agonist 8-oh-dpat in hippocampus, lateral septal nucleus and amygdala, as well as those displaceable by the d(2) antagonist sulpiride in striatum, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. in drug discrimination tests, the mixed, d(1)/d(2) agonist apomorphine, the partial d(2) receptor agonists (-)-3-ppp and terguride and the 5-ht(1a) agonist 8-oh-dpat substituted for  xxxd2498xxx . the d(1) agonist skf38393, the d(1) antagonist sch23390, the d(2) antagonist sulpiride, the 5ht(1b) agonist m-cpp and the 5-ht(2) agonist doi were not generalized to the  xxxd2498xxx  cue. in antagonism tests, the d(2) antagonist haloperidol and the 5-ht antagonist  xxxd2621xxx  both induced partial but significant antagonism to the  xxxd2498xxx  cue, but the d(1) antagonist sch23390 did not. these results indicate that discriminative stimulus properties of  xxxd2498xxx  are mediated by the dual activation of 5-ht(1a) and d(2) receptor sites in brain.
