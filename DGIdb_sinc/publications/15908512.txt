although the existence of adrenergic neurons within the
central nervous system (cns) has been well established,
many of their functions remain unexplored. it is known that
most norepinephrine (ne)-containing neurons arise from
brain stem nuclei and project multiple branched axons
throughout the cns (moore and bloom, 1979). due to this
rich and widespread projection of adrenergic axons, it is

abstract
norepinephrine is an endogenous neurotransmitter distributed
throughout the mammalian brain. in higher cortical structures
such as the hippocampus, norepinephrine, via ␤ adrenergic
receptor (ar) activation, has been shown to reinforce the cognitive processes of attention and memory. in this study, we
investigated the effect of ␤1ar activation on hippocampal
cornu ammonis 3 (ca3) network activity. ar expression was
first determined using immunocytochemistry with antibodies
against ␤1ars, which were found to be exceptionally dense in
hippocampal ca3 pyramidal neurons. ca3 network activity
was then examined in vitro using field potential recordings in rat
brain slices. the selective ␤ar agonist  xxxd2401xxx  caused an
enhancement of hippocampal ca3 network activity, as measured by an increase in frequency of spontaneous burst discharges recorded in the ca3 region. in the presence of ␣ar
blockade, concentration-response curves for  xxxd2401xxx ,

materials and methods
reagents. the pharmacological agents used were obtained from
the following sources: atenolol, butoxamine hydrochloride, (⫺)-epinephrine bitartrate salt, (⫺)- xxxd2401xxx  (⫹)-bitartrate salt dehydrate, (⫾)-metoprolol (⫹)-tartrate salt, (⫺)-norepinephrine (⫹)-bitar-

trate salt hydrate,  xxxd2914xxx  methanesulfonate salt, and
 xxxd2947xxx  (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo); ici-118,551 (tocris cookston inc., ellisville, mo); sodium pentobarbital (ampro pharmaceutical, arcadia, ca); and isoflurane (abbott diagnostics, chicago, il).
the immunohistological agents used were obtained from sigmaaldrich, including sodium nitrite, paraformaldehyde, para-picric
acid, sodium phosphate buffer, sucrose, glycerol, and triton x-100.
all reagents used to make the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (acsf)
were from j. t. baker (phillipsburg, nj).
animals. sprague-dawley rats, postnatal day 12 to 29 (p12–29)
were housed with their mothers in cages (16.5 ⫻ 8.5 inches) kept in
rooms maintained at a temperature of ⬃22°c with a relative humidity of ⬃55%. water and dried laboratory food (teklad global 18%
protein rodent diet; harlan teklad, madison, wi) were provided ad
libitum. lighting was set to a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on  xxxd2274xxx :00
am). rats were allowed to acclimate for 4 days after arrival from
harlan (indianapolis, in) before their use. all protocols described
were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee
of the university of north dakota in accordance with the national
institutes of health guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals.
immunocytochemistry. five sprague-dawley rats (p20 –21;
50 –70 g) were anesthetized with pentobarbital and perfused transcardially with 100 ml of ice-cold (4°c) 0.9% saline containing 0.1%
sodium nitrite followed by 400 ml of ice-cold, freshly prepared fixative consisting of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.16% para-picric acid in
0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, ph 7.4. the brain was removed
immediately after perfusion and postfixed for 2 h in ice-cold fixative
followed by cryoprotection for at least 48 h in ice-cold (4°c) 25%
sucrose and 10% glycerol in 50 mm phosphate buffer. sagittal sections of brain (20 ␮m in thickness) were cut on a freezing sliding
microtome (leica 3000r) and collected into 0.1 m sodium phosphate
buffer, ph 7.4, containing 0.9% saline (phosphate-buffered saline)
and processed for immunohistochemistry as described below.
whole brain sections were incubated for 48 to 72 h at 4°c with
anti-␤1ar (santa cruz biotechnology, inc., santa cruz, ca) or anticalmodulin kinase-ii ( xxxg329xxx ; chemicon international, temecula,
ca) primary antibodies alone or simultaneously.  xxxg329xxx  is a
marker of pyramidal neurons. all primary antibodies were diluted
1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% triton x-100
(pbs-t). after the primary incubation, the sections were washed in
two 20-min washes in pbs-t and then incubated for 1.5 h at room
temperature with cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or donkey
anti-mouse igg secondary antibodies (jackson immunoresearch
laboratories, west grove, pa) diluted 1:100 in pbs-t. sections were
then washed for 20 min in pbs-t, 20 min in 50 mm tris-hcl, and
mounted onto gel-coated slides using 50 mm tris-hcl, ph 7.4. slides
were coverslipped with vectashield (vector laboratories, burlingame, ca) antifade mounting medium. for double-immunofluorescence labeling, anti-␤1ar and anti- xxxg329xxx  primary antibody labeling was visualized using cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit igg and
fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit igg secondary antibodies (both 1:100; jackson immunoresearch laboratories). immunohistochemical controls consisted of primary omission
for both single and double immunohistochemistry labeling. analysis
of immunoreactivity and determination of labeling colocalization
were undertaken using standard fluorescence microscopy (bx-60;
olympus, melville, ny) and image analysis (spot rt slider;
imagepro, sterling heights, mi).
slice preparation. hippocampal brain slices were prepared from
sprague-dawley rats (p12–29; 25–90 g) as follows. briefly, animals
were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, sacrificed by decapitation,
and their brains were rapidly removed. hippocampi were dissected
from each hemisphere and placed into a beaker of ice-cold saline
solution containing 110 mm choline chloride, 2.5 mm kcl, 7 mm
 xxxd2534xxx , 0.5 mm cacl2, 1.25 mm nah2po4, 25 mm nahco3, 25 mm
glucose, 11.6 mm sodium ascorbate, and 3.1 mm sodium pyruvate.
the hippocampi were sectioned transversely into 500-␮m-thick slices

alzheimer’s disease (hyman et al., 1984; braak and braak,
1997) and schizophrenia (luchins, 1990), has been shown to
be exceptionally vulnerable to ischemia and anoxia (tekkok
and ransom, 2004), and is of particular interest in epilepsy
due to its low seizure threshold and frequent involvement in
hyperexcitable episodes (johnston and amaral, 2004). the
hippocampus is also the site where a form of activity-dependent synaptic enhancement, called long-term potentiation
(ltp), was first shown. this potentiation of excitatory activity may be the cellular basis of learning and memory (bliss
and collingridge, 1993).
specificity in the adrenergic system is believed to be
achieved primarily through a distinct and diverse expression
pattern of postsynaptic adrenergic receptors (ars). activation of these ars is often seen to produce state-dependent or
enabling effects, with different receptor subtypes often mediating opposing effects within a cell. pharmacological and
molecular cloning studies have revealed the existence of
three ␤ar subtypes (␤1, ␤2, and ␤3), based upon both sequence homologies and affinity values for subtype-selective
ar antagonists. although all ␤ars are positively coupled to
adenylyl cyclase via activation of the g protein gs, each
subtype has its own unique pharmacological characteristics,
particularly for catecholamine ar agonists (pupo and minneman, 2001). for example, the relative potencies of  xxxd2401xxx  (iso), ne, and epinephrine (epi) differ at each receptor subtype: iso ⬎ ne ⱖ epi for ␤1; iso ⬎ epi ⬎ ne for
␤2; and iso ⬎ ne ⬎ epi for ␤ xxxd484xxx  (lands et al., 1967;
emorine et al., 1989; bylund et al., 1994). in addition, iso is
essentially equipotent at ␤1 and ␤2ar subtypes, whereas it
is considerably less potent for the ␤ xxxd484xxx  (liggett, 1992; galitzky et al., 1995; shimizu et al., 1996). although much is
known about the role of ␤ar subtypes in the periphery, far
less is known about their function in the cns.
all three ␤ar subtypes are found in the brain, albeit the
␤ xxxd484xxx  subtype seems to have a very limited expression pattern (pupo and minneman, 2001). in the hippocampus, ␤ar
activation has been shown to facilitate ltp (hopkins and
johnston, 1984; gelinas and nguyen, 2005) as well as to
enhance certain memory processes (murchison et al., 2004).
delineating which subtype of ␤ar mediates specific physiological functions in the hippocampus would help clarify a role
for the ar system in cognitive function.
the goal of this study was to characterize the effect of ␤ar
subtype activation on hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (ca3)
network synchronization in the rat hippocampus. immunohistochemical staining and rank order of potencies for catecholamine-mediated responses suggested that activation of a
␤1ar population was increasing synchronous burst activity
in the ca3 region. functional determination of subtype-selective ␤ar antagonist affinity values were used to support
this assumption. kb values calculated using schild regression analysis confirmed our hypothesis that ␤1ar activation
is responsible for the enhanced hippocampal ca3 network
activity observed in this model of adrenergic transmission.

using a conventional tissue sectioning apparatus (stoelting, wood
dale, il). the hippocampal slices were incubated at 34 ⫾ 1°c in
acsf containing in 119 mm nacl, 5 mm kcl, 1.3 mm  xxxd2534xxx , 2.5
mm cacl2, 1 mm nah2po4, 26.2 mm nahco3, and 11 mm glucose,
for 30 min before being allowed to recover for at least an additional
30 min at room temperature (22 ⫾ 1°c). all solutions were continually aerated with 95% o2, 5% co2.
electrophysiological recordings. a single slice was transferred to the recording chamber, where it was submerged and superfused continuously at a rate of 2 to 4 ml/min with acsf. glass
microelectrodes were made using a two-stage puller (pp-830;
narashige, tokyo, japan). extracellular field potentials were recorded using microelectrodes filled with 3 m nacl and placed in the
stratum pyramidale of ca3 region of the hippocampus. currents
were detected using an axoclamp 2b (axon instruments inc., union
city, ca), amplified  xxxd1891xxx  or 100⫻ using a brownlee precision model
440 instrumentation amplifier (brownlee precision, san jose, ca),
digitized at 1 khz with a digidata 1322a analog-to-digital converter
(axon instruments inc.), and recorded using axoscope 9.0 software
(axon instruments inc.).
it has been established that hippocampal ca3 pyramidal neurons
will fire burst discharges due in part to extensive recurrent circuitry
(traub et al., 1991). this activity can be elicited by attenuating
synaptic inhibition using a gabaa receptor antagonist such as  xxxd2947xxx . since this particular characteristic is present exclusively in
ca3 pyramidal cells, the frequency of burst discharges can serve as
a selective measure of hippocampal ca3 neural network activity.
all experiments were performed at room temperature (22 ⫾ 1°c).
slices were continually superfused with acsf containing  xxxd2947xxx 
at 100 ␮m (to elicit burst discharges) and any applicable receptor
antagonists. if no burst discharges were seen after 20 min of perfusion, the slices were determined to be unresponsive and discarded.
once burst discharges were evident, 30 min of baseline data was
recorded before any exposure to agonist. preliminary experiments
were conducted to ensure that pharmacological antagonists showed
no effect on their own and that each agonist dose produced its
maximum effect in the time allotted (data not shown).
data analysis. burst discharge frequency was analyzed using
mini analysis 6.0 (synaptosoft, decatur, ga). frequency versus

agonist concentration data were then entered into graphpad prism
4.0 (graphpad software inc., san diego, ca), and concentrationresponse curves were constructed using a nonlinear least-squares
curve-fitting method. concentration-response curves for an agonist
were plotted as percentage of maximal response. each curve was fit
with a standard (slope ⫽ unity) or variable slope, and the best fit was
determined using an f-test with a value of p ⬍ 0.05. the calculated
ec50 value was used as a measurement of agonist potency. significance between groups was tested using an unpaired two-tailed student’s t test (p ⬍ 0.05).
schild analysis was used to functionally determine apparent equilibrium dissociation constants (pkb) for atenolol, butoxamine, ici118,551, and  xxxd2629xxx  (arunlakshana and schild, 1959). for each
experiment, cumulative concentration-response curves were performed in adjacent hippocampal slices of the same rat (one concentration-response curve per slice). dose ratios of ec50 values in the
presence and absence of a selective ar antagonist were calculated
and schild plots constructed by graphing the log of the dose ratio ⫺
1 versus the log of the concentration of that ar antagonist (arunlakshana and schild, 1959). linear regression analysis of these plotted points was used to determine the slope and x-intercept of the
schild regressions. schild regression slopes are expressed as the
mean ⫾ 95% confidence interval and were only considered different
from unity if the 95% confidence interval did not include the value of
1 (kenakin, 1997). the pkb values of subtype-selective ␤ar antagonists causing competitive inhibition of agonist initiated burst discharge frequencies were calculated from schild regression x-intercepts. differences in pkb values and schild regression slopes were
determined by analysis of covariance with a p ⬍ 0.05 level of probability accepted as significant. calculated values (i.e., ec50 and kb)
are expressed as the mean ⫾ s.e.m. for n experiments.

served along the plasma membrane of both the perikarya and
proximal dendrites of putative pyramidal cells in the hippocampal ca3 region (fig. 1, a and b). compared with the
perikarya, dendrites displayed a lower concentration of ␤1ar
immunofluorescent labeling. as a control, a similar intense
␤1ar immunofluorescent labeling was observed in fixed sections of the rat heart (fig. 1a, inset), and alternatively,
minimal ␤1ar labeling was documented in tissue preparations from the rat lung (data not shown). within the hippocampus, ␤1ar immunoreactivity was observed on pyramidal cells in all three cytoarchitectural regions, with cells in
the ca3 displaying the heaviest labeling (fig. 1a).  xxxg329xxx 
immunofluorescence was also observed within pyramidal
cells of the stratum pyramidale in the same cytoarchitectural
regions of the hippocampus. this labeling was localized

within both perikarya and proximal processes (fig. 1c).
these  xxxg329xxx  results reflect those reported previously and
confirm the utility of  xxxg329xxx  as a marker of pyramidal cells
in the hippocampus (goto et al., 1993). in tissue double
labeled for  xxxg329xxx  and ␤1ar,  xxxg329xxx -labeled pyramidal
cells in the ca3 also displayed intense and abundant somatic
and dendritic ␤1ar immunofluorescent puncta (fig. 1d).
these results suggest that there is a distinct pattern of ␤1ar
expression located predominantly on the hippocampal ca3
pyramidal neurons. these data, however, do not give an
indication as to the role this ␤ar subtype may be performing
with respect to hippocampal network activity.

similar experiments using 10, 30, 100, and 300 nm of
metoprolol again produced 3-, 6-, 26-, and 56-fold parallel

curve (fig. 4c). the schild regression slope for metoprolol
(fig. 4d) included the value of unity (1.0 ⫾ 0.2) and the
calculated apparent kb (3.9 ⫾ 1.7 nm) correlates to published
values of metoprolol for the ␤1ar subtype (table 1). the

pretreated with 500, 1000, 3000, and 10,000 nm ici-118,551
produced 3-, 5-, 9-, and 27-fold parallel rightward shifts of the
fitted iso concentration-response curve (fig. 5a). dose ratios calculated for each ici-118,551 concentration were used
for schild regression analysis (fig. 5b). the slope of the

recorded extracellularly from the hippocampal ca3 pyramidal cell layer. for these recordings, the electrode was placed
precisely in the area of the ca3 region that showed the
greatest intensity of ␤1ar and  xxxg329xxx  immunofluorescence (fig. 2). as illustrated in fig. 2a,  xxxd2947xxx -induced
burst discharges seen as sharp biphasic spikes. the depolarizing/hyperpolarizing waveform corresponds to a series of
population spikes followed by an afterhyperpolarization in
ca3 pyramidal neurons (traub et al., 1991). application of
the selective ␤ar agonist iso caused a concentration-dependent increase in the number of these events (fig. 2). using a
frequency histogram of the iso-induced increase in burst
discharges (fig. 2b), a concentration-response curve can be
constructed from a plot of maximal burst frequency versus
iso concentration (fig. 2b, inset). for this experiment, the
ec50 value calculated from nonlinear regression analysis
was 13.7 nm. overall, the mean ec50 value for iso-induced
increased burst firing was 13.6 ⫾ 1.3 nm (n ⫽ 14) (fig. 2c),
suggesting that iso initiates an enhancement of hippocampal ca3 network activity most likely through ␤ar activation.
effects of endogenous catecholamines on hippocampal ca3 network activity. since ne and epi are
the endogenous agonists for ␤ar-mediated responses in the
rat hippocampus, we compared the effects of these nonselective ar agonists to iso on hippocampal ca3 burst activity
frequency in the presence of ␣ar blockade. after pretreatment of slices with 10 ␮m  xxxd2914xxx , application of iso,
ne, or epi again caused a concentration-dependent increase
in the frequency of hippocampal burst discharges (fig. 3).
the potency of iso in the presence of  xxxd2914xxx  (14.4 ⫾
1.8 nm; n ⫽ 5) was not significantly different from iso ec50
values calculated in the absence of ␣ar blockage (13.6 ⫾ 1.3
nm; n ⫽ 14). this illustrates that the iso-mediated effects on
the hippocampus are caused by selective ␤ar activation and
not due to a nonspecific ar response. conversely, the ec50 of
ne (307 ⫾ 64 nm; n ⫽ 5) and epi (231 ⫾ 21 nm; n ⫽ 5) for
increasing ca3 network activity were similar compared with
each other but were significantly less potent when evaluated
against iso. this rank order of potency (iso ⬎ ne ⫽ epi) is
consistent with results by others who historically characterized catecholamine-initiated responses caused by ␤1ar activation (lands et al., 1967). as expected for full ar agonists,
there were no significant differences between the maximal
effects produced by ne, epi, or iso (data not shown).
effect of selective ␤1ar competitive antagonists on
the iso-mediated increase in discharge frequencies.
functional determination of subtype-selective ␤ar antagonist affinity values were used to characterize the ␤ar subtype mediating increased burst frequency in the hippocampal
ca3 region. initially, ca3 field potential recordings generated by increasing amounts of iso in the absence and presence of fixed selective ␤1ar antagonist concentrations were
used for schild regression analysis (fig. 4). hippocampal
slices that had been pretreated with 200, 500, 1000, and 2000
nm atenolol produced 4-, 8-, 16-, and 30-fold parallel rightward shifts of the fitted iso concentration-response curve
(fig. 4a). dose ratios calculated for individual runs were
plotted against each atenolol concentration to generate a
straight line using linear regression analysis (fig. 4b). the
schild regression slope included the value of unity (1.1 ⫾

the low-affinity values calculated for these selective ␤2ar
antagonists to inhibit iso initiated burst activity indicates
that ␤1ar activation is the specific ar mediating this ca3
response.

discussion
there is currently little information regarding the morphological or functional localization of ars in the hippocampus.
in this study, we aim to offer evidence for a specific ␤ar
subtype-mediated enhancement of hippocampal ca3 network activity. previous studies have suggested ␤1ar activa-

tion may mediate powerful excitatory actions on pyramidal
cells in the hippocampus. therefore, we first investigated an
anatomical basis for this excitatory action by examining the
abundance and distribution of immunohistochemically localized ␤1ar on the somatic and dendritic plasma membrane of
 xxxg329xxx -identified pyramidal cells (goto et al., 1993). ␤1ar
labeling was present on the perikarya and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells in all three cytoarchitectural regions
in the rat hippocampus. the heaviest labeling was observed
along the plasma membrane and within the cytoplasm of
cells within the ca3 region. less abundant ␤1ar labeling
was observed in the ca1 pyramidal cell layer compared with

ca3, which is indicative of a distinct pattern for ␤ar subtype
expression. this observation is supported by molecular and
functional studies that show a lack of ␤1ar expression and
functionality from ca1 pyramidal cells (hillman et al.,
2005a,b). this distinct and diverse ␤ar subtype expression
pattern would provide a means for ar signaling specificity in
the hippocampus.
before introduction of subtype-specific ar antagonists,
␤ar subtypes were traditionally identified using a profile of
ar agonists (lands et al., 1967). in the present study, application of the selective ␤ar agonist iso or the nonselective
ar agonists, ne or epi, in the presence of ␣ar blockade

caused a concentration-dependent increase in the frequency
of hippocampal ca3 burst discharges. for this response, iso
was found to have the highest potency of these tested ar
agonists, whereas ne was equipotent to epi. the high potency of iso to initiate an increased ca3 burst discharge
implies that ␤ xxxd484xxx  activation is not mediating this function
(hoffmann et al., 2004). furthermore, a rank order of potency demonstrating iso ⬎ ne ⫽ epi implies that the ␤1ar
population identified from immunohistochemical analysis
may be responsible for this hippocampal ca3 hyperexcitability (lands et al., 1967; bylund et al., 1994).
additional support of our hypothesis for a ␤1ar mediation
of hippocampal ca3 hyperexcitability comes from functional
determination of subtype-selective ␤ar antagonist affinity
values using the method of arunlakshana and schild (1959).
increasing concentrations of all ␤ar antagonists used in this
study caused parallel rightward shifts in the iso concentration-response curves without significantly reducing maximal
effects, demonstrating the competitive property of these receptor antagonists. low apparent equilibrium dissociation
constants calculated for the selective ␤1ar antagonists
atenolol and metoprolol support our belief that ␤1ar activation enhances ca3 network activity. moreover, high apparent kb values determined for the selective ␤2ar antagonists
ici-118,551 and butoxamine maintain our assertion that
activated ␤1ar subtypes are mediating this hippocampal
ca3 response. the pharmacological profile in our studies is
comparable with the ki values of these subtype-selective ␤ar
antagonists for ␤1ars as determined by others using radioligand binding studies (quast and vollmer, 1984; juberg et
al., 1985). in addition, the rank order of affinity values for
these subtype-selective ␤ar antagonists ( xxxd2629xxx  ⬎
atenolol ⬎⬎ ici-118,551 ⬎ butoxamine) is consistent with the
characteristics for a ␤1ar subtype described in other investigations (table 1). together, these results indicate that iso
activation of ␤1ar subtypes is mediating the increased network activity in the ca3 hippocampus.
until recently, little was known about the role of hippocampal ca3 activity in the cognitive functions of attention
and memory, except that ltp had been demonstrated at the
recurrent collateral-ca3 synapses. however, recent evidence
indicates that the ca3 pyramidal neurons, which mediate
network activity, play a crucial role in associative memory
recall (nakazawa et al., 2002) and rapid memory acquisition
(nakazawa et al., 2003). furthermore, new in vivo studies
with mutant mice lacking ne has confirmed a role for ne in
memory retrieval (murchison et al., 2004). moreover, selective use of ar agents also suggested that this ne function
required signaling through a hippocampal ␤1ar subtype.
since ␤ar activation has been previously shown to decrease
calcium-activated potassium conductance by a camp-dependent mechanism (madison and nicoll, 1986a,b), we speculate
that ␤1ar activation enhances hippocampal ca3 network
activity by increasing glutamatergic neurotransmission between recurrent collaterals of pyramidal cells, most likely by
decreasing calcium-activated potassium conductance in a
camp-dependent manner. additional experiments are currently being performed to confirm this hypothesis.
in conclusion, we provide functional evidence that ␤1ar
activation increases hippocampal ca3 burst activity. we hypothesize that this ␤1ar-mediated enhancement of ca3 net-
