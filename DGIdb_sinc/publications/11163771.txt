1. introduction
 xxxg1660xxx  (pah,  xxxg1660xxx ) is a metabolic enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine using
molecular oxygen, enzyme-bound iron, and a  xxxd3166xxx  (bh4 ) cofactor [1^5]. pah is a member of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family, together with tyrosine
hydroxylase (th,  xxxg2276xxx ) and tryptophan hydroxylase
(tph,  xxxg2315xxx ). th and tph are involved in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters, l-dopa ( xxxd2471xxx ) and serotonin, respectively. the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases share a similar enzyme mechanism and
have a common three-domain structure consisting of an nterminal regulatory domain, a catalytic domain and a c-terminal tetramerisation domain; the highest sequence and structural similarity is found in the catalytic domain [6].
the regulatory domains of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylases are not highly conserved, re£ecting the di¡erent
modes of regulation required by these enzymes. pah controls

the level of phenylalanine, an essential amino acid, which is
toxic at pathophysiological levels and is subject to large £uctuations due to dietary intake. accordingly, mutations in the
pah gene lead to the disease phenylketonuria [7]. pah is
therefore by necessity tightly controlled by a variety of mechanisms, including activation by phenylalanine, inhibition by
bh4 and additional activation by phosphorylation [2]. activation by the substrate phenylalanine is considered the major
regulatory event. phenylalanine is proposed to bind cooperatively to either an allosteric site, physically distinct from the
catalytic site [8], or directly to the active site [9]. phenylalanine
activation leads to large conformational changes as inferred
from an increase in tryptophan £uorescence [10], exposure of
a hydrophobic surface [8], and a change in susceptibility to
proteolysis [11].
the natural cofactor bh4 acts as a negative regulator. bh4
has been reported to block phenylalanine activation [12]
through binding to a site distinct from the bh4 catalytic
site, and forming an inactive bh4 ^pah complex [13]. the
phenylalanine-activated pah is not inhibited by bh4 [12].
synthetic cofactors such as 6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin
(6-meph4 ) do not have this inhibitory e¡ect [12]. finally,
phosphorylation by camp-dependent protein kinase at ser16 [14] is believed to act as a mediator of phenylalanine activation by decreasing the phenylalanine concentration required
to activate the enzyme [15].
the only available three-dimensional structure of an aromatic amino acid hydroxylase that includes the regulatory
domain is that of a dimeric rat pah lacking the c-terminal,
24-residue tetramerisation domain (pah1ÿ428 ) [16]. the catalytic properties of pah1ÿ428 are indistinguishable from the
full-length enzyme [17], and it is similarly regulated by phenylalanine [17], phosphorylation [18] and bh4 (this work). one
of the most interesting features of the structure of the regulatory domain is the location of the n-terminal sequence (amino acids 19^29), which reaches into the active site of the
catalytic domain (fig. 1). this sequence may consequently
autoinhibit the enzyme, acting as an intrasteric autoregulatory
sequence ( xxxg1124xxx ) [16,19]. however, the mechanism of the
autoinhibition is unclear, as the proposed binding sites for
pterin [20,21] and phenylalanine [22] would not be obstructed
by the  xxxg1124xxx . residues 1^18, containing the phosphorylatable
ser-16, are mobile in both the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of pah1ÿ428 [16]. nevertheless, the comparison of the structure of pah1ÿ428 [16] with the structures of
the constitutively active fragments lacking the regulatory domain [23,24] shows that there are no signi¢cant structural
di¡erences in the active site regions, suggesting that the regu-

hcl (ph 7.25), 10 mm phenylalanine, 0.1 mm edta (bu¡er 1)
containing 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl £uoride, 0.4 wg/ml pepstatin and 0.4 wg/ml leupeptin, and sonicated. the cell extract was centrifuged at 27 200ug for 20 min. the supernatant was puri¢ed by
ammonium sulphate precipitation (50% w/v). following dialysis
against bu¡er 1, the protein was applied to a de-52 cellulose column
and eluted with a linear gradient of 0^0.3 m kcl. the eluted peak
was dialysed against 50 mm na2 hpo4 /nah2 po4 (ph 7.0) containing
10% glycerol (bu¡er 2) and applied to a column (5 ml bed volume) of
biogel htp hydroxyapatite (bio-rad) equilibrated with bu¡er 2. following a 50 ml wash with bu¡er 2, the protein was eluted with a linear
gradient of 50^350 mm na2 hpo4 /nah2 po4 (ph 7.0) containing 10%
glycerol. fractions containing pah30ÿ428 were pooled and dialysed
twice against 2 l of 30 mm tris^hcl (ph 7.25), 0.15 m kcl and
0.1 mm edta. pah1ÿ428 was expressed in insect cells and puri¢ed
using phenyl-sepharose chromatography [18].
2.2. limited proteolytic digestion
pah was activated, where indicated, by incubation with 10 mm
phenylalanine for 10 min at 25³c. limited proteolytic digestion was
carried out by incubating pah with chymotrypsin at an enzyme:protein ratio of 1:50 at 25³c. digestion was stopped by the addition of
an equal volume of a solution containing 4% (w/v) sodium dodecyl
sulphate (sds), 30% glycerol (v/v) and 10%  xxxd26xxx  (v/v) in
10 mm tris^hcl (ph 6.8) and heating at 90³c for 5 min. samples
were then analysed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1%
(w/v) sds (sds^page).
2.3. enzyme activity assay
to measure enzyme activity, pah was added last to a cuvette
containing 100 mm k2 hpo4 /kh2 po4 (ph 6.8), 65 wg/ml catalase,
2.75 mm phenylalanine, 6 mm dithiothreitol and either 60 wm
6-meph4 or 90 wm bh4 (schirck's laboratories, jona, switzerland),
at 20³c. activity was estimated by measuring the absorbance change
at 275 nm over the initial 60 s of the reaction with the activity expressed as nmol of tyrosine produced/min, using an extinction coef¢cient for tyrosine of 1700. because pah1ÿ428 and pah30ÿ428 are
di¡erent protein preparations, the absolute activity values should
not be directly compared.

[16]) is shown with the  xxxg1124xxx  (gly-19 to gln-30) in dark grey, and

latory domain must be responsible for the regulation of pah
activity.
to elucidate the role of the  xxxg1124xxx  in pah regulation we
expressed a pah protein lacking 29 n-terminal amino acids
(pah30ÿ428 ) and characterised its regulatory properties. we
show that pah30ÿ428 is constitutively active (i.e. it does not
require phenylalanine activation), shows an altered structural
response to phenylalanine, and is not negatively regulated by
bh4 . our results add functional support to the model previously suggested based on structural data, whereby the n-terminal sequence is responsible for autoinhibition and for transmitting the e¡ect of phenylalanine activation to the active site.
2. materials and methods
2.1. protein expression and puri¢cation
pah30ÿ428 cdna was cloned into the pkkt7 plasmid (atcc,
usa [25]). protein expression was induced at 30³c for 5 h by the
addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-l-d-galactopyranoside. all puri¢cation procedures were carried out at 4³c unless otherwise stated.
cells were pelleted, frozen and thawed, resuspended in 0.05 m tris^

3. results
3.1. cloning and expression of the pah30ÿ428 protein
the dna coding for the pah30ÿ428 protein was expressed
in escherichia coli, and puri¢ed by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion exchange chromatography and hydroxyapatite
chromatography. the puri¢ed pah30ÿ428 protein has the expected mw of 46 kda as analysed by sds^page (fig. 2).
n-terminal protein sequencing of puri¢ed pah30ÿ428 generated the expected amino acid sequence (data not shown).
3.2. activation by phenylalanine
the extent of activation by phenylalanine was assayed by
adding unactivated pah or pah activated by 10 mm phenylalanine to a cuvette containing all the other components suf¢cient for pah enzyme activity (table 1). in the presence of
the synthetic cofactor 6-meph4 , phenylalanine activation of
pah1ÿ428 resulted in a four-fold increase in kcat ; the removal
of the n-terminus (pah30ÿ428 ) decreased the phenylalanine
activation to two-fold. in the presence of the natural cofactor
bh4 , phenylalanine activation of pah1ÿ428 expectedly produced a more prominent 12.5-fold increase in kcat . by contrast, phenylalanine activation of pah30ÿ428 had little e¡ect
(1.1-fold activation). thus, in the presence of bh4 the removal of the n-terminus produced a constitutively active enzyme
with little or no requirement for phenylalanine activation.

pah (8.6 wg), either activated in the presence of 10 mm phenylalanine for 10 min at 25³c, or not activated, was added last to a cuvette containing the enzyme reaction mixture with 60 wm 6-meph4 or 90 wm bh4 as the cofactor. enzyme speci¢c activity is expressed as nmol tyrosine produced/min/nmol pah subunit).

was assessed by assaying at bh4 concentrations below those
required for catalysis but su¤cient for pah inhibition, and
using 6-meph4 as the cofactor in the pah assay (6-meph4 is
not a pah inhibitor) [13] (table 2). enzyme activity of
pah1ÿ428 , which under these experimental conditions re£ects

phenylalanine activation, was signi¢cantly decreased (by 64%)
in the presence of bh4 . by contrast, no bh4 inhibition was
observed for pah30ÿ428 , lacking the n-terminal  xxxg1124xxx .
3.4. limited chymotryptic digestion and hydrophobic
interaction chromatography
upon limited chymotryptic digestion, a 31-kda fragment is
generated from phenylalanine-activated pah1ÿ428 , that has
previously been shown [26] to correspond to the catalytic
domain of pah (amino acids 120^424) (fig. 2a). unactivated
pah1ÿ428 is more resistant to chymotryptic digestion ; less
catalytic fragment accumulates. in phenylalanine-activated
pah30ÿ428 , the generation of the catalytic fragment is slowed
down when compared to pah1ÿ428 (fig. 2b). it is reassuring
that only subtle di¡erences are observed in the proteolytic
patterns, suggesting no major structural perturbations in the
truncated protein.
previously, both the full-length phenylalanine-activated
pah [8] and the phenylalanine-activated pah1ÿ428 [17] have
been shown to bind to phenyl-sepharose and could subsequently be eluted from the resin by a phenylalanine-free bu¡er. this behaviour has been postulated to be due to phenylalanine activation of pah causing conformational changes
that expose a hydrophobic surface, which can bind to phenyl-sepharose [8]. signi¢cantly, phenylalanine-activated
pah30ÿ428 did not bind strongly to phenyl-sepharose and
was eluted in the ¢rst wash of the column (in a bu¡er containing 10 mm phenylalanine and 4.8% (v/v) dimethyl formamide).
4. discussion
the crystal structure of pah1ÿ428 revealed that the n-terminal sequence of the regulatory domain of the enzyme
reached into the active site, suggesting it played an autoinhibitory role [16]. however, the mechanism of autoinhibition

fig. 3. schematic diagram of a simpli¢ed regulatory pathway of
pah, involving regulation by phenylalanine, bh4 and phosphorylation. the large object represents a monomer of pah, with the large
protrusion as the catalytic domain and the small protrusion as the
regulatory domain. the dashed ellipse with fe is the active site, and
the thick curved line is the  xxxg1124xxx . little is currently known about
the locations of phenylalanine and bh4 binding sites; they are
shown in arbitrary locations in the model. ei depicts the autoinhibited state ( xxxg1124xxx  obstructs the active site, bh4 is bound to its regulatory site); ea depicts the activated state (phenylalanine bound to
its activation site, bh4 ready to bind to its catalytic site); ei * depicts an intermediate inactive state with no e¡ectors bound to their
regulatory sites. pterin binding to the active site induces localised
conformational changes in the catalytic domain and the pterin molecule [20].

was not clear, and no direct functional data were available to
support this hypothesis.
here we show functional evidence supporting the regulatory
mechanism based on the structural data, suggesting the 29
amino-terminal residues of pah are directly responsible for
the autoinhibited state of pah, and that this sequence transmits the e¡ect of phenylalanine activation through to the active site. we deleted the n-terminal 29 amino acids from the
dimeric protein pah1ÿ428 and expressed, puri¢ed and characterised the regulatory properties of the resulting protein
pah30ÿ428 . the dimeric pah1ÿ428 was used as the template
to avoid any complications resulting from the use of the fulllength protein which exists as a mixture of dimers and tetramers. the regulatory and catalytic properties of pah1ÿ428
are indistinguishable from the full-length protein [17,18].
in contrast to pah1ÿ428 or full-length pah, the pah30ÿ428
protein was found to be constitutively active; activation by
phenylalanine was not required for enzyme activity. consistent with previous studies on human pah [27], the e¡ect of
phenylalanine was more dramatic when the natural cofactor,
bh4 , rather than the synthetic cofactor, 6-meph4 , was used
in the pah assay. in addition, the inhibition of pah activation by bh4 was abolished by the removal of the n-terminal
29 amino acids. pah30ÿ428 therefore mimics phenylalanineactivated pah, which is not inhibited by bh4 [12]. the
changed limited proteolysis pattern generated by chymotrypsin digestion of pah30ÿ428 , and the low a¤nity of pah30ÿ428
for phenyl-sepharose suggest that the conformational changes
generated by phenylalanine activation of pah1ÿ428 do not
occur as e¤ciently in the constitutively active pah30ÿ428 .
a model for the regulation of pah enzyme activity by
phenylalanine, bh4 and phosphorylation consistent with the

available structural and functional data is shown in fig. 3. ei
depicts the autoinhibited state where the  xxxg1124xxx  obstructs the
active site and bh4 is bound to its regulatory site (fig. 3, left
column). phenylalanine binding to its activation site causes
conformational changes, during which the  xxxg1124xxx  must move
away from its position at the active site and bh4 can bind to
its catalytic site, resulting in the activated state ea (fig. 3,
right column). the middle column in fig. 3 depicts an intermediate inactive state with no e¡ectors bound to their regulatory sites (ei *); this is the only state for which structural
information is currently available. phosphorylation (fig. 3,
bottom row) most likely aids the transition from ei to ea
by facilitating the phenylalanine-induced conformational
changes through stabilising the phenylalanine-activated form
[16].
the members of the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family share signi¢cant amino acid sequence and structural similarities in their catalytic domains, but their regulatory domains are less conserved. however, the basic folds of the
regulatory domains [16] as well as some aspects of the regulatory mechanisms may be conserved among the family members. in th, catecholamines form an inactive th complex by
binding to the enzyme-bound iron. phosphorylation of th at
ser-40 by camp-dependent protein kinase decreases the a¤nity of dopamine for the iron 300-fold [28]. in line with the
results reported here for pah, th lacking the n-terminal 39
amino acids was found not to be inhibited by catecholamines
[29]. limited proteolysis studies showed that amino acids 33
to 50 on the th sequence were less sensitive to proteolysis
when dopamine was bound to th, and more sensitive to
proteolysis when th was phosphorylated at ser-40 [30].
therefore, similarly to the  xxxg1124xxx  of pah, the n-terminal sequence of th plays an integral role in the regulation of th
activity, acting in concert with catecholamine to form the
inactive th, and phosphorylation produces conformational
changes that a¡ect the n-terminus and cause the dissociation
of the catecholamine^th complex, resulting in the active enzyme. by contrast, it has very recently been shown that the
deletion of 15 n-terminal residues of tph does not a¡ect the
catalytic properties of that enzyme [31]; the regulatory mechanisms in tph, however, remain to be elucidated.
