recent work indicates that ppar␣ is required for perﬂuorooctanoic acid (pfoa)-induced postnatal lethality resulting from prenatal exposure. the present study tested the hypothesis that relatively modest
activation of ppar␣ during prenatal development will cause postnatal lethality, similar to that observed
with pfoa, a relatively low afﬁnity ppar␣ agonist. female wild-type and ppar˛-null mice were mated
overnight with males of the same genotype. the presence of a copulatory plug on the  xxxd2476xxx 
mating was indicative of pregnancy and considered gestation day (gd) 0. plugged female mice were
fed either a control diet or one containing cloﬁbrate (0.5%) or wy-14,643 (0.005%) until gd18 or until
parturition. mice were examined on gd18 or on postnatal day (pnd) 20 following the prenatal exposure period. dietary administration of cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 did not affect maternal weight or weight
gain, the average number of implantations, the percentage of litter loss, the average number of live/dead
fetuses, average crown-rump length, or the average fetal weight on gd18 in either genotype. an increase
in relative maternal liver weight and elevated expression of ppar␣ target genes in maternal and fetal
livers on gd18 were observed, indicative of ppar␣-dependent changes in both the maternal and fetal
compartments. however, no defects in postnatal development were observed by either cloﬁbrate or wy14,643 in either genotype by pnd20. these results demonstrate that relatively low level activation of
ppar␣ by cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 during prenatal development does not cause postnatal lethality.

1. introduction
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (ppars) are ligandactivated, soluble nuclear receptors that include three isoforms:
ppar␣, ppar␤ (also referred to as ppar␦ or ppar␤/␦) and ppar␥.
ppar␣ is expressed in most tissues but is noticeably higher in
liver, kidney and heart (auboeuf et al., 1997; braissant et al., 1996;
braissant and wahli, 1998) where it is known to regulate expression
of proteins required for fatty acid transport, catabolism, and energy
homeostasis (peters et al., 2005). the ﬁbrate class of hypolipidemic
drugs, phthalate monoesters and perﬂuorinated compounds are all
known to activate ppar␣ (bility et al., 2004; forman et al., 1997;
maloney and waxman, 1999; wolf et al., 2008a). in addition to
its known essential role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis,
activation of ppar␣ also causes an increase in hepatocyte proliferation leading to hepatocellular carcinoma in rodents (hays et

al., 2005; peters et al., 1998, 1997; reddy et al., 1980); humans
appear to be refractory to these effects (gonzalez and shah, 2008;
klaunig et al., 2003; peters, 2008; peters et al., 2005). more recently,
evidence has also surfaced suggesting that ppar␣ is essential for
modulating postnatal lethality observed in rodents exposed to perﬂuorooctanoic acid (pfoa) during prenatal development (abbott et
al., 2007).
pfoa is one of a number of perﬂuorinated compounds that are
capable of causing activation of ppar␣ (wolf et al., 2008a). perﬂuorinated compounds are not extensively metabolized in vivo
because of the strong covalent bond between carbon and ﬂuorine
atoms (ullrich and diehl, 1971) and are hence environmentally persistent (liou et al., 2010). recent studies show that exposure to
pfoa during prenatal development results in dose-dependent fulllitter resorptions, as well as delayed development and postnatal
lethality in cd-1 mice (lau et al., 2006) and 129/sv mice (abbott et
al., 2007). these effects are mediated by ppar␣, as they are found in
wild-type mice but not in ppar˛-null mice (abbott et al., 2007). evidence also exists suggesting that these effects are due to gestational
exposure to pfoa that may cause alterations in mammary gland
function but are not due to lactational exposure of pfoa (lau et al.,
2006; white et al., 2007; wolf et al., 2007). the present study was

control for detecting contamination and genomic ampliﬁcation. all reactions had
>85% efﬁciency. relative expression levels of mrna were analyzed for statistical
signiﬁcance using anova and post hoc tests.

2. materials and methods

data were analyzed for statistical signiﬁcance using analysis of variance and the
tukey’s post hoc test (prism 5.0a, graphpad software inc., san diego, ca). the criterion used to determine statistical signiﬁcance was p ≤ 0.05. for fetal and neonatal
endpoints, statistical analysis revealed essentially identical results when the individual or litter was used as the statistical unit (data not shown). figure legends
indicate whether the individual or litter was used as the statistical unit.

2.1. animal studies
animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use
committee at the pennsylvania state university, which conforms to the guide for
the care and use of laboratory animals published by the national institutes of
health. male and female wild-type and ppar˛-null mice (lee et al., 1995) on a 129/sv
genetic background (akiyama et al., 2001) were used for this study.
2.1.1. study design
female wild-type or ppar˛-null mice were mated overnight with male mice of
the same genotype, and examined for the presence of a copulatory plug after mating.
the presence of a copulatory plug was considered indicative of successful mating
and designated gestation day (gd) 0. pregnant female mice were weighed and randomly assigned to one of three groups and fed either a control diet, a diet containing
0.5% cloﬁbrate (dyets, inc., bethlehem, pa) or a diet containing 0.005% wy-14,643
(dyets, inc., bethlehem, pa). mice were fed these diets until gd18 or until parturition. after parturition, all groups of mice were fed the control diet. mice were
examined on either gd18 or on postnatal day (pnd) 20. the dietary concentrations
of ppar␣ agonists were chosen in an attempt to model the relative ability of pfoa
to activate ppar␣ in the liver and cause approximately a doubling of relative liver
weight as shown by previous studies in rodent models (lee et al., 1995; marsman et
al., 1992; wolf et al., 2008b), an effect which is known to be associated with increased
developmental delays and neonatal lethality (abbott et al., 2007). the rationale that
this approach would achieve low level activation of ppar␣ is based in part on several relationships. dietary cloﬁbrate at a dose of 0.5% causes an increase in rat liver
weight of ∼1.5-fold after 3 weeks of treatment, while 0.005% wy-14,643 causes an
increase in rat liver weight of ∼2-fold after 3 weeks of treatment (marsman et al.,
1992). this is consistent with the fact that cloﬁbrate is less effective for increasing ppar␣-dependent reporter activity as compared to wy-14,643 (shearer and
hoekstra, 2003). it is also known that pfoa is less effective at activating ppar␣
as compared to wy-14,643 (maloney and waxman, 1999) and that doses of pfoa,
capable of causing a modest (∼1.5–2-fold) increase in maternal liver weight, cause
marked developmental delay and neonatal lethality (abbott et al., 2007). cloﬁbrate
was chosen as one model ppar␣ agonist because it is a relatively less effective agonist (e.g. one that would cause low level activation) as compared to wy-14,643 based
on cell based reporter assays, and is more comparable with the pfoa in terms of activating ppar␣ based on similar cell based reporter assays (maloney and waxman,
1999; shearer and hoekstra, 2003). the very low dietary level of the ppar␣ agonist
wy-14,643 was selected in part because it is more effective at activating ppar␣, and
should thus more closely model ppar␣ activation observed in response to pfoa.
these relationships were collectively used to establish a dosing paradigm that was
predicted to cause low level activation of ppar␣.
for gd18 analyses, pregnant mice were euthanized by overexposure to carbon
dioxide, and livers were carefully dissected and snap frozen until later use. gravid
uterine weights were recorded. for each litter, the number of live fetuses, dead
fetuses and resorption sites were counted. the sex of each fetus was determined,
crown to rump length was measured, and fetal and fetal liver weights were recorded.
fetal livers were snap frozen after weighing for rna analysis.
for pnd20 analysis, pregnant mice were allowed to deliver their litters and day
of parturition was recorded. pups were weighed on the day of delivery and on pnd7,
pnd14 and pnd20. the pups were observed daily to determine postnatal lethality,
and the onset of eye opening was examined as a measure of postnatal development.
dams and pups were euthanized by overexposure to carbon dioxide on pnd20 and
livers were obtained by dissection and snap frozen after weighing for rna analysis.
2.2. quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) analysis
total rna was isolated from liver samples using ribozol (amresco, solon, oh).
for maternal liver, four independent samples from four mice from each group were
used. for fetal liver, samples from one fetus randomly chosen from each of four
individual litters were used. for neonatal liver, samples from one pup representing each of four litters were used. the cdna was generated using 2.5 ␮g total rna
with multiscribe reverse transcriptase kit (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). the
mrnas encoding the known ppar␣ target genes, cytochrome p450 4a10 (cyp4a10)
and  xxxg43xxx  (aco), were measured using qpcr analysis. the sequence
for the forward and reverse primers used to quantify mrnas for cyp4a10, aco and
internal control, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( xxxg861xxx ) are described
previously (foreman et al., 2009). pcr reactions were carried out using sybr® green
supermix for iq (quanta biosciences, gaithersburg, md) in the icycler and detected
using the myiq real-time pcr detection system (bio-rad laboratories, hercules,
ca). the conditions used for pcr were 95 ◦ c for 15 s, 94 ◦ c for 10 s, 60 ◦ c for 30 s,
and 72 ◦ c for 30 s, repeated for 45 cycles. the pcr included a no template reaction

3.1. effect of prenatal ppar˛ agonism on maternal and fetal
endpoints on gd18
prenatal exposure to pfoa in pregnant female mice causes an
increase in resorptions and postnatal lethality in surviving offspring
(abbott et al., 2007; lau et al., 2006). the increase in postnatal
lethality in mice was associated with doses of pfoa where relative
liver weight is twice that of control as observed in non-pregnant
mice (wolf et al., 2008b). thus, the effect of prenatal exposure to
the ppar␣ agonists cloﬁbrate and wy-14,643 at doses that are also
associated with causing approximately a doubling of liver weight
in non-pregnant mice and rats (lee et al., 1995; marsman et al.,
1992), was determined in wild-type and ppar˛-null mice. average
maternal weight and average maternal weight gain during pregnancy were not inﬂuenced by exposure to 0.5% cloﬁbrate or 0.005%
wy-14,643 as compared to controls in both genotypes (table 1). no
differences in the average number of implants per dam, the average number of live or dead fetuses per litter, the average number
of resorptions per litter, the percentage of litter loss, the average
fetal weight or the average crown to rump length were observed in
litters examined from mice of both genotypes treated with either
cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 as compared to control (table 2). additionally, no difference in the distribution of male and female fetuses
was observed by either treatment in either genotype compared to
control (table 2).
ppar␣ agonists are known to increase replicative dna synthesis and hyperplasia in the liver through a ppar␣-dependent
mechanism (peters et al., 1998). compared to controls, relative
maternal liver weight on gd18 was increased by cloﬁbrate and
wy-14,643 in wild-type mice but not in similarly treated ppar˛null mice (fig. 1a). in contrast, relative fetal liver weight on gd18
was increased only modestly in wild-type mice by cloﬁbrate but
not by wy-14,643 as compared to control, while relative fetal liver
weight was unchanged by cloﬁbrate and wy-14,643 in ppar˛-null
mice (fig. 1b). to determine the relative efﬁcacy of cloﬁbrate and
wy-14,643 to activate ppar␣ in maternal and fetal liver, expression of the well characterized ppar␣ target genes aco and cyp4a10
was quantiﬁed. expression of aco and cyp4a10 mrna was increased
by cloﬁbrate and wy-14,643 in both maternal liver and fetal liver
as compared to control, and these effects were not found in similarly treated ppar˛-null mice (fig. 1c–f). interestingly, the relative
increase in expression of aco and cyp4a10 mrna was higher in
wy-14,643-treated fetuses as compared to the increase observed
in maternal liver (fig. 1c–f). these data clearly demonstrate that
the doses of cloﬁbrate and wy-14,643 effectively activated ppar␣
causing modest maternal liver hepatomegaly and increased expression of target genes known to modulate lipid catabolism.
3.2. effect of prenatal ppar˛ agonism on postnatal development
since prenatal exposure to pfoa led to reduced survival of pups
and delayed development (as assessed by the onset of eye opening)
in wild-type mice but not in ppar˛-null mice (abbott et al., 2007),

postnatal development was assessed in the present study following prenatal exposure to either cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643. the day
of parturition was not affected by prenatal exposure to either cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 in either genotype (table 3). postnatal lethality
of pups up until pnd20 was not different between cloﬁbrate or
wy-14,643-treated wild-type or ppar˛-null mice as compared to
controls (fig. 2a). similarly, the onset of eye opening and postnatal weight gain was not inﬂuenced by prenatal exposure to either
cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 in either genotype as compared to controls (fig. 2b and c). additionally, no differences in the distribution
of male and female pups were observed by either treatment (data
not shown) and no changes in postnatal weight gain between male
and female pups in the different treatment groups were observed
(table 3). relative maternal liver weight (data not shown) and relative pup liver weight (fig. 3) were not changed on pnd20 following
prenatal exposure to either cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 in either genotype as compared to control. similarly, relative expression of the
ppar␣ target genes aco and cyp4a10 in maternal liver was not dif-

ferent on pnd20 following prenatal exposure to either cloﬁbrate
or wy-14,643 in either genotype as compared to control (data
not shown). compared to control, relative expression of aco and
cyp4a10 mrna in pup liver was not different on pnd20 following
prenatal exposure to either cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 in wild-type or
ppar˛-null mice (fig. 3b and c).
4. discussion
previous studies demonstrated that prenatal exposure to pfoa
results in dose-dependent full-litter resorptions, delayed development and postnatal lethality in mice (abbott et al., 2007; lau et
al., 2006). as these effects are found in wild-type mice but not in
ppar˛-null mice, this demonstrates that these effects are mediated
by ppar␣ (abbott et al., 2007). cross-fostering studies established
that gestational exposure to pfoa, rather than lactational exposure to pfoa, is required to elicit defects in postnatal development
including delays in the onset of eye opening and early lethality

different letters are signiﬁcantly different, p ≤ 0.05, as determined by anova and tukey’s test.

(wolf et al., 2007). since pfoa is known to cause activation of
ppar␣, the present study tested the hypothesis that relatively low
level activation of ppar␣ during prenatal development will cause
postnatal lethality, similar to that observed with pfoa, a relatively
low afﬁnity ppar␣ agonist. dietary administration of cloﬁbrate
and wy-14,643 during prenatal development caused a ppar␣dependent increase in maternal liver, consistent with the known
mitogenic activity associated with ppar␣ activation in liver (peters
et al., 1998). similarly, a ppar␣-dependent increase in expression
of the ppar␣ target genes, aco and cyp4a10, was also observed in
both maternal and fetal liver on gd18 providing direct evidence
that ppar␣ activity was increased in both maternal and fetal compartments. surprisingly, prenatal exposure to the ppar␣ agonists
cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 did not cause any developmental anomalies assessed on gd18, nor did it cause any developmental delays in
eye opening or postnatal lethality of pups. these results are similar
to those previously reported with perﬂuorobutyrate (pfba) where
no adverse developmental toxicity was observed following prenatal exposure (das et al., 2008). this is of interest because pfba is a

short-chain perﬂuorinated chemical that has shorter half-life than
pfoa and a weaker potency for ppar␣ activation as compared to
pfoa (chang et al., 2008; wolf et al., 2008a).
these studies do not dispute the fact that prenatal pfoa exposure in mice causes neonatal lethality through a ppar␣-dependent
mechanism (abbott et al., 2007). moreover, the reason why prenatal exposure to pfoa causes ppar␣-dependent postnatal lethality,
while prenatal exposure to either cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643 does not,
cannot be determined from this study. this disparity could be due
in part to differences in gene expression resulting from prenatal
exposure to the different compounds. it is also possible that this
disparity is due in part to differences in bioaccumulation. pfoa is
known to persist in environment and is not metabolized extensively in vivo because of the strong covalent bond between carbon
and ﬂuorine (ullrich and diehl, 1971). in mice, the half-life of pfoa
has been estimated to be 15.6 days (lou et al., 2009) whereas
cloﬁbrate and wy-14,643 have comparatively shorter half-lives.
for example, the half-life of cloﬁbrate in humans is 15 h because
it is readily absorbed from gastrointestinal tract, metabolized by

cyp3a4, and excreted (miller and spence, 1998). thus, prenatal
exposure to pfoa could cause accumulation of pfoa in fetal liver
that subsequently inﬂuences postnatal development due to more
sustained ppar␣ activity, while cloﬁbrate and wy-14,643 are less
likely to result in this effect. this idea is supported by the observed
ppar␣-dependent increase in relative liver weight in pnd22 pups
from pfoa-exposed dams at doses ≤1.0 mg/kg (abbott et al., 2007).
in contrast, results from the present studies show that relative liver
weight in pnd20 pups from cloﬁbrate or wy-14,643-exposed dams
is not different than controls and no changes in expression of the
ppar␣ target genes aco and cyp4a10 levels are found. combined,
these ﬁndings suggest that prenatal exposure to pfoa could cause
accumulation in fetal liver that inﬂuences postnatal development
through ppar␣-dependent mechanisms, while cloﬁbrate and wy14,643 do not.
several studies have examined the effects of either prenatal
or neonatal exposures to lactating rodents treated with various
ppar␣ ligands, including wy-14,643, nafenopin, cloﬁbrate, ciproﬁbrate, and diethylhexyl phthalate (dehp) (cibelli et al., 1988; cimini
et al., 1994; fahl et al., 1983; singh and lazo, 1992; stefanini
et al., 1989, 1999, 1995; wilson et al., 1991). collectively, these
studies show that exposure to ppar␣ agonists induces both peroxisome proliferation and increased expression of ppar␣ target
genes (e.g. aco, cyp4a10) in fetal and neonatal rodents. interestingly, 14-day-old rat pups exhibit enhanced sensitivity to ppar␣

fig. 3. effect of prenatal ppar␣ agonism on pup liver endpoints on pnd20. pregnant

liver weight (liver weight (g)/body weight (g) × 100) on pnd20. relative expression

activity as compared to older rat pups (dostal et al., 1987). this is
the ﬁrst evidence suggesting that neonatal rodents are more sensitive than adults to ppar␣ activation. results from the present
studies are consistent with this idea because the relative increase
in expression of aco mrna resulting from prenatal exposure to
both cloﬁbrate and wy-14,643 was higher in fetal liver on gd18
as compared to maternal liver. while this effect was not found
with the increase in expression of cyp4a10 mrna following prenatal exposure to cloﬁbrate, relatively higher cyp4a10 mrna was
found in fetal liver on gd18 as compared to maternal liver as a
result of prenatal exposure to wy-14,643. the signiﬁcance of this
apparent difference in sensitivity to ppar␣ agonism remains to be
determined.
