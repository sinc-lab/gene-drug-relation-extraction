abstract
the a 2 -adrenoreceptor antagonist mirtazapine, which is also a 5-ht 2 , 5-ht 3 and h 1 receptors antagonist and the selective serotonin
(5-ht) reuptake inhibitor paroxetine are effective antidepressant drugs which enhance 5-ht neurotransmission via different mechanisms.
the present studies were undertaken to determine whether the mirtazapine–paroxetine combination could induce an earlier and / or a
greater effect on the 5-ht system than either drug alone. using in vivo electrophysiological paradigms, the firing activity of dorsal raphe
5-ht neurons was decreased by 70% in rats treated with paroxetine (10 mg / kg / day, s.c.) for 2 days and was back to normal after 21
days. in contrast, a 2-day treatment with mirtazapine (5 mg / kg / day, s.c.) did not alter the firing of 5-ht neurons whereas it was increased
by 60% after 21 days of treatment. a low dose of mirtazapine (5 mg / kg / day, s.c.32 days) failed to offset the decremental effect of
paroxetine on the 5-ht neuron firing activity, but a higher dose (10 mg / kg / day, s.c.32 days) did attenuate the decremental effect of
paroxetine. in the dorsal hippocampus, neither mirtazapine (5 mg / kg / day, s.c.) nor a paroxetine (10 mg / kg / day, s.c.) treatment altered
the responsiveness of 5-ht 1a receptors to microiontophoretically-applied 5-ht. both in controls and in rats treated for 2 days with
paroxetine alone, the administration of the 5-ht 1a antagonist way 100635 (25–100 mg / kg, i.v.) did not change the firing activity of
dorsal hippocampus ca 3 pyramidal neurons. however, way 100635 increased significantly the firing activity of these neurons in rats
treated with mirtazapine alone but to a greater extent with both mirtazapine and paroxetine for 2 days. after 21 days of treatment, way
100635 increased to a greater degree the firing rate of ca 3 pyramidal neurons in rats which received the combination over rats given
either drug alone. it is concluded that the mirtazapine–paroxetine combination shortened the delay in enhancing the tonic activation of
postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors and produced a greater activation of the postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors than either drug given alone. the
present results suggested that mirtazapine may have a faster onset of action than a ssri, and that the co-administration of mirtazapine and
paroxetine may accelerate the antidepressant response and as well as being more effective than either drug alone.  2000 elsevier

1. introduction
although the physiopathology of major depression is not
fully defined, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting the implication of the serotonin (5-ht) system in the
therapeutic effect of antidepressant treatments (heninger
and charney, 1987; price et al., 1990; van praag et al.,
1990; cummings, 1993; blier and de montigny, 1994;
maes and meltzer, 1995). it has been shown that long-term
tricyclic antidepressant (tca) and repeated electroconvul*corresponding author. tel.: 11-514-398-7304; fax: 11-514-3984486.

sive shock (ecs) administration lead to an enhanced 5-ht
neurotransmission through a sensitization of the postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors (de montigny and aghajanian, 1978;
de montigny, 1984; welner et al., 1989; nowak and
dulinski, 1991; stockmeier et al., 1992). long-term treatment with either  xxxg1357xxx   xxxg1358xxx  inhibitors (maois)
or selective 5-ht reuptake inhibitors (ssris) results in a
desensitization of the somatodendritic 5-ht 1a autoreceptor
of 5-ht neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, thereby
allowing their firing rate to recover in the presence of the
drugs (blier et al., 1986; chaput et al., 1986). in addition,
long-term ssri treatment also desensitizes terminal
5-ht 1b (in the rat) and 5-ht 1d (in the guinea-pig)

autoreceptors, whereas long-term maoi treatment desensitizes terminal a 2 -adrenergic heteroreceptors located on
5-ht terminals (blier and bouchard, 1994; mongeau et
al., 1994), the role of both receptors being to inhibit 5-ht
¨
release (gothert,
1980). long-term treatment with the
antidepressant mirtazapine, an a 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist,
increases 5-ht neurotransmission, as a result of a sustained increase in the firing activity of 5-ht neurons in
presence of decreased function of a 2 -adrenergic
heteroreceptors located on 5-ht terminals (haddjeri et al.,
1997). finally, long-term treatment with 5-ht 1a receptor
agonists, such as gepirone, desensitizes the 5-ht 1a autoreceptor on 5-ht neurons, but not the postsynaptic
5-ht 1a receptors located on ca 3 pyramidal neurons
(blier and de montigny, 1987; schechter et al., 1990;
godbout et al., 1991; fanelli and mcmonagle-strucko,
1992; dong et al., 1998; haddjeri et al., 1999).
recently, novel direct evidence of an enhanced 5-ht
neurotransmission by antidepressant treatments have been
provided (haddjeri et al., 1998). this study showed that
long-term treatment with either the tca imipramine, the
ssri paroxetine, the selective and reversible mao-a
befloxatone, the a 2 -adrenergic antagonist mirtazapine, the
5-ht 1a receptor agonist gepirone or repeated ecs therapy
enhanced the tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a
receptors in the dorsal hippocampus, as put into evidence
by the enhanced disinhibition produced by the acute
administration of the selective 5-ht 1a receptor antagonist
way 100635 (haddjeri et al., 1998).
the present study was undertaken to determine whether
the association of mirtazapine with the ssri paroxetine
could act in synergy to enhance 5-ht neurotransmission.
this was deemed of interest because these drugs have been
shown to modulate the 5-ht system via different mechanisms. thus, using in vivo electrophysiological paradigms
in the rat dorsal raphe and dorsal hippocampus, the effects
of short-term and long-term treatments with mirtazapine
and paroxetine, given alone and in combination, on the
firing activity 5-ht neurons and on the degree of activation of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors have been assessed.

2. materials and methods

2.1. animals and treatments
male sprague–dawley rats (charles-river, quebec,
canada) weighing 300620 g on the day of the experiment
were used. the animals were maintained on a 12:12 h
light–dark cycle with free access to food and water. rats
were treated for 2 or 21 days with either mirtazapine (5 or
10 mg / kg / day), paroxetine (10 mg / kg / day), or the
combination (mirtazapine–paroxetine), using osmotic
minipumps (alza, palo alto, ca, usa) implanted subcutaneously on the dorsal region of the rat under halothane
anesthesia. mirtazapine and paroxetine were dissolved in a

water– xxxd102xxx  (80:20, v / v and 50:50, v / v, for the
2 day- and 21 day treatments, respectively). for each
series of experiments, controls were implanted with a
minipump filled with the same vehicle as the corresponding treated groups. rats receiving the mirtazapine–
paroxetine combination were implanted with two
minipumps. all the experiments were carried out with the
minipumps on board. none of these treatments altered the
normal behavior of the animals in their cages or upon
handling, and the weight gain was similar in the treated
groups than in controls. the regimens above have been
chosen on the basis of previous experiments indicating a
marked blockade of 5-ht reuptake with 10 mg / kg / day of
˜
paroxetine (pineyro
et al., 1994), and a blockade of a 2 adrenoceptors by 5 mg / kg / day of mirtazapine after a
long-term administration (haddjeri et al., 1997).

2.2. electrophysiological procedures
rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (400 mg / kg,
i.p.) and were mounted in a stereotaxic apparatus. additional doses (100 mg / kg, i.p.) were given to maintain the
anesthesia along the experiment.

2.2.1. extracellular unitary recordings from dorsal
raphe 5 -ht neurons
a hole was drilled 1 mm anterior to lambda on the
midline. 5-ht neurons were recorded with single-barreled
glass micropipettes filled with a 2 m nacl solution. their
impedance range was between 2 and 4 mv. the dorsal
raphe nucleus was encountered at a depth of 5–6 mm
below the surface of the brain. the 5-ht neurons were
identified according to the criteria of aghajanian (1978),
by their slow (0.5–2.5 hz) and regular firing rate and
long-duration (0.8–1.2 ms) positive action potentials. once
5-ht neurons were identified, their spontaneous firing
activity was recorded for 50–100 s to determine their mean
baseline firing rate.
2.2.2. extracellular recording and microiontophoresis
from dorsal hippocampus ca 3 pyramidal neurons
a hole was drilled 4.2 mm lateral and 4.2 mm anterior
to lambda. extracellular recordings of dorsal hippocampus
ca 3 pyramidal neurons and microiontophoretic applications of 5-ht were performed with five-barreled glass
micropipettes pulled in the conventional manner in order to
achieve a tip diameter of 10–15 mm. the central recording
barrel was filled with a 2 m nacl solution saturated with
fast green dye. one of the side-barrels was filled with
 xxxd3068xxx  (1.5 mm in 400 mm nacl, ph 8) since a
leak or a small ejection current (12 to 24 na) of
 xxxd3068xxx  was needed to activate the ca 3 hippocampus
pyramidal neurons within their physiological range in
anesthetized animals. these neurons were identified according to the criteria of kandel and spencer (1961): large
amplitude and long duration complex spike discharges.
two side-barrels were filled with 5-ht (10 mm in 200

a. besson et al. / european neuropsychopharmacology 10 (2000) 177 – 188

mm nacl, ph 4). two ejection currents of 5-ht were
used (5 and 10 na), each ejection period lasting for 50 s.
the fourth barrel was filled with 2 m nacl and served as
an automatic current balance.
in order to assess the blockade of the 5-ht transporter
produced by paroxetine, the rt 50 values after microiontophoretic applications of 5-ht (5 and 10 na) were
determined. the rt 50 value corresponds to the time (in
seconds) required to achieve a 50% recovery of the firing
activity of the neuron once the microiontophoretic application of 5-ht has been stopped (de montigny et al., 1980).
this parameter is a reliable index of the in vivo activity of
monoamine reuptake process in the rat hippocampus and
previous studies have shown an increase of the rt 50
values for 5-ht after acute intravenous paroxetine injections or after the lesion of the 5-ht pathways by the
˜
neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (pineyro
et al., 1994).
we mainly focused our interest on overall 5-ht transmission by assessing the tonic activation of the postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors of the dorsal hippocampus ca 3
pyramidal neurons. to this end, we compared the firing
rate of dorsal hippocampus ca 3 pyramidal neurons before
and after the systemic injection of the selective 5-ht 1a
receptor antagonist, way 100635, via a lateral tail vein
cannula in control and treated groups. it is well established
that the suppression of the firing activity of ca 3 pyramidal
neurons by microiontophoretic applied 5-ht is mediated
through the activation of 5-ht 1a receptors (de montigny
et al., 1984). if a tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a
receptors exists, the firing activity of hippocampus ca 3
pyramidal neurons will be lowered even though the
responsiveness of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors to 5-ht
is unchanged. then, the blockade of these 5-ht 1a receptors by way 100635 will disinhibit the ca 3 hippocampus pyramidal neurons resulting in an increase of their
firing activity (haddjeri et al., 1998). in this series of
experiments the current of  xxxd3068xxx  was chosen in order
to obtain a firing rate around 3 hz in order to more readily
allow the detection of enhancements in firing following
administration of way 100635. the baseline firing was
recorded for at least 2 min before the intravenous injection
of way 100635. an intravenous injection of saline
preceded the first injection of way 100635 to eliminate
any effect due to the injection by itself. the saline
injection corresponds to the 0 mg / kg dose. way 100635
was administered in incremental doses of 25 mg / kg at time
intervals of 1–2 min. to avoid residual drug effects, only
one cell was studied in each rat. since way 100635,
administered intravenously, did not modify the firing rate
of 5-ht neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of anesthetized rats (forster et al., 1995; lejeune and millan,
1998; haddjeri et al. unpublished observations), it can be
assumed that any changes in the firing activity of hippocampus pyramidal neurons would reflect an increased
level in the tonic activation of the postsynaptic 5-ht 1a
receptors. therefore, in treated animals, where there would
be increased extracellular levels of 5-ht in the raphe

179

region, way 100635 would restore 5-ht neuronal firing
activity. however, because way 100635 was given systemically, it would be simultaneously blocking the effects
of 5-ht on postsynaptic neurons, thereby cancelling out
the effect of way 100635 on the somatodendritic autoreceptors. indeed, if the action of way 100635 at the
somatodendritic 5-ht 1a autoreceptors was influencing the
activity of the hippocampal neurons, it would serve to
further inhibit their firing due to an increased release of
5-ht into the target area. thus, it can be assumed that any
increment in the firing activity of hippocampus pyramidal
neurons would reflect an increased level in the tonic
activation of the postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors and the
degree to which way 100635 disinhibits this firing would
be a direct measure of the tonic level of activation of these
receptors by extracellular 5-ht.

2.3. drugs
mirtazapine ( xxxd2651xxx ) was provided by organon
(oss, the netherlands), paroxetine by smithkline beecham (harlow, uk) and way 100635 by wyeth–ayerst
(princeton, nj, usa). 5-ht creatinine sulfate and  xxxd3068xxx  were purchased from sigma (st. louis, mo,
usa).

2.4. statistical analyses
results were expressed as mean6s.e.m. anova followed by the student newman–keuls test with a 0.05
statistic level of significance for the pairwise comparisons
were used for all the statistical analyses except for the
analysis of the results obtained with the short-term treatments in the dorsal raphe. in this latter series of experiments two doses of mirtazapine (5 and 10 mg / kg / day)
were used. however, we were a priori interested in
comparing the effects of the mirtazapine–paroxetine
combination with either drug given alone and not in
comparing the effect of one dose of mirtazapine to the
other. for this reason, it was more appropriate to use
student’s t-tests followed by the bonferroni correction for
this set of data.
one- and two-way repeated measure anova were used
to determine the effects of the different treatments on the
firing rate of dorsal hippocampus ca 3 pyramidal neurons
when repeated doses of way 100635 were given.

spontaneous firing activity of 5 -ht neurons of the dorsal

following a 2-day treatment with paroxetine (10 mg /

activity of dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons (fig. 1). in rats

treated with mirtazapine (5 or 10 mg / kg / day, s.c.) for 2
days, the firing activity of 5-ht neurons appeared to be
increased in a dose-dependent manner (12% and 19% with
5 and 10 mg / kg / day of mirtazapine, respectively; fig. 1),
although this did not reach statistical significance. when
the low dose of mirtazapine (5 mg / kg / day, s.c.) was
co-administered with paroxetine for 2 days, the firing rate
of 5-ht neurons was similar to that observed with of
paroxetine alone (fig. 1). however, the co-administration
of the high dose of mirtazapine (10 mg / kg / day, s.c.)
significantly attenuated the reduction of the serotonergic
firing activity produced by paroxetine (fig. 1).
in rats treated with paroxetine (10 mg / kg / day, s.c.) for
21 days, the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons
was not significantly different from the control group (fig.
2). in rats treated with mirtazapine (5 mg / kg / day, s.c.) for

21 days, there was a significant increase (60%) of the
firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons. in the mirtazapine–paroxetine group, the firing activity of 5-ht
neurons was similar to that of controls (fig. 2).

3.2. recovery time of dorsal hippocampus pyramidal
neurons after microiontophoretic applications of 5 -ht
both the 2- and 21-day treatments with paroxetine (10
mg / kg / day, s.c.) significantly prolonged the rt 50 following the microiontophoretic application of 5-ht with both
ejections currents used (5 and 10 na), whereas mirtazapine
(5 mg / kg / day, s.c.) was without effect on this parameter.
the paroxetine-induced prolongation of the rt 50 was not
modified by the co-administration of mirtazapine (fig. 3).

3.3. tonic activation of the postsynaptic 5 -ht1 a
receptors on the dorsal ca 3 hippocampus pyramidal
neurons by mirtazapine and paroxetine
as illustrated in fig. 4, the injection of saline did not
alter the firing activity of the dorsal hippocampus ca 3
pyramidal neurons in any of the groups. in control rats, the
intravenous injection of the 5-ht 1a antagonist way
100635 (haddjeri et al., 1998) did not modify the firing
activity of ca 3 pyramidal neurons within a dose range of
25–100 mg / kg (rueter et al., 1998; figs. 4a and 6a).
similarly, in rats treated with paroxetine for 2 days, the
intravenous injection of way 100635 failed to modify the
firing activity of ca 3 pyramidal neurons (figs. 4c and
6a). in rats treated with mirtazapine for 2 days, an increase
in the mean firing rate of ca 3 pyramidal neurons was
observed in response to intravenous injection of way

100635 (38%, 68%, 62% from baseline with 50, 75, 100
mg / kg of way 100635, respectively; fig. 6a). in fact,
these increases did reach statistical significance (p50.008,
using the kruskal–wallis one-way anova on ranks).
moreover, following the 2-day co-administration of mirtazapine and paroxetine for 2 days, way 100635 induced a
clear dose-dependent increase of the firing activity of
hippocampus ca 3 pyramidal neurons (fig. 6a).
as for the 21-day treatments with either mirtazapine or
paroxetine alone, way 100635 induced a dose-dependent
increase of the mean firing activity of ca 3 pyramidal
neurons (fig. 5). the degrees of increased in firing activity
of these neurons induced by way 100635 in the mirtazapine- and in the paroxetine-treated groups were similar
(fig. 6b). when mirtazapine and paroxetine were coadministered, the increase of the firing activity of ca 3
pyramidal neurons in response to way 100635 was much

greater than that observed with paroxetine or mirtazapine
alone (figs. 5 and 6b).

4. discussion
two main points of interest emerge from the present
electrophysiological studies concerning the concomitant
administration of the a 2 -adrenoreceptor antagonist mirtazapine and the ssri paroxetine. first, the delay for
obtaining an increased tonic activation of postsynaptic
5-ht 1a receptors is shortened by the combination of
mirtazapine and paroxetine. second, the combination
induced a greater enhancement of the tonic activation of
postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors than either drug given
alone.
the marked decrease of the firing activity of dorsal
raphe 5-ht neurons and followed by recovery, after the
short-term and the long-term administration of paroxetine
respectively (figs. 1 and 2), is in agreement with previous
studies (see blier and de montigny, 1994 for review;

romero et al., 1996). the decreased firing activity of 5-ht
neurons induced by short-term treatments with various
ssris has been suggested to result from a greater activation of somatodentritic 5-ht 1a autoreceptors due to the
increased levels of extracellular 5-ht in the dorsal raphe
produced by ssris (bel and artigas, 1992; hjorth et al.,
1995; romero et al., 1996). the recovery of firing activity
upon pursuing the ssri treatment results from a desensitization of these somatodentritic 5-ht 1a autoreceptors (see
blier and de montigny, 1994 for review).
previous studies have established that the firing activity
of 5-ht neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus is dependent
on the tonic activation of a 1 -adrenoreceptors located on
the soma and dendrites of these neurons (svensson et al.,
1975; baraban and aghajanian, 1980a,b). the transient
increase of the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons
induced by the acute administration of mirtazapine (250
mg / kg, i.v.) has been shown to be due to the enhancement
of noradrenaline (na) release, leading to a greater activation of their a 1 -adrenoreceptors (haddjeri et al., 1996). in
the present study, the 2-day treatment with mirtazapine did

183

184

not increase significantly the firing activity of 5-ht
neurons. this contrasts with the 80% increase of the firing
activity of dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons produced by an
acute injection of mirtazapine (250 mg / kg, i.v.; haddjeri et
al., 1996). this apparent discrepancy might be due to
lower cerebral concentrations of mirtazapine attained after
a 2-day subcutaneous administration than after an intravenous bolus. however, after 21 days of administration,
mirtazapine (5 mg / kg / day, s.c.) significantly increased
(60%) the spontaneous firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-ht
neurons, possibly due to a desensitization of a 2 -adrenergic
heteroreceptors located on 5-ht terminals (haddjeri et al.,
1997), as previously reported.
when the two drugs were co-administered for 2 days,
the low dose of mirtazapine (5 mg / kg / day, s.c.) failed to
reverse the paroxetine-induced reduction of the firing
activity of dorsal raphe 5-ht neurons. however, the high
dose of mirtazapine (10 mg / kg / day, s.c.) did attenuate the
suppressant effect of paroxetine (fig. 1). when the two
antidepressant drugs were co-administered during 21 days,
the mirtazapine-induced increase of the firing rate of 5-ht
neurons was no longer present. altogether these results
suggest that a physiological opposition between the 5ht 1a autoreceptor and the postsynaptic a 1 -adrenoceptor
may exist, that is the opposing actions of paroxetine and
mirtazapine on 5-ht neuronal firing activity would tend to
cancel each other.
a pharmacokinetic interaction between mirtazapine and
paroxetine is unlikely to account for the above results since
mirtazapine does not alter the activity of the cytochrome
p450 isoenzymes (delbressine and vos, 1997), and the
inhibitory effect of paroxetine on the activity of cyp2d6
(bauman, 1996; lane, 1996) would rather lead to increased plasma levels of mirtazapine. a competitive
interaction at the receptor level can also be ruled out since
both mirtazapine and paroxetine have negligible affinity
for 5-ht 1a receptors (tulloch and johnson, 1992; de
boer, 1996; goodwin, 1996), and paroxetine has no
affinity for adrenoreceptors (goodwin, 1996; frazer,
1997).
an interaction at the level of the locus coeruleus can,
however, be involved in the effects of the combination of
mirtazapine and paroxetine (fig. 2). na neurons of the
locus coeruleus receive a dense 5-ht input (steinbusch,
1984) and send projections to the dorsal raphe nucleus
(loizou, 1969; anderson et al., 1977). previous studies
from our laboratory have provided evidence for a decreased firing activity of locus coeruleus na neurons
following a long-term treatment with paroxetine (10 mg /
kg / day, s.c.; szabo et al., 1999). preliminary results
suggest that when mirtazapine (5 mg / kg / day, s.c.) and
paroxetine (10 mg / kg / day, s.c.) are co-administered, the
increased firing activity of locus coeruleus na neurons
induced by mirtazapine alone is prevented by concomitant
paroxetine administration. thus, the decremental effect of
paroxetine on the firing activity of locus coeruleus na

neurons might dampen the incremental one of mirtazapine
which acts as antagonist at somatodentritic a 2 -adrenergic
autoreceptors on these neurons. this would prevent the
enhancement of na release in the dorsal raphe nucleus and
the consequent activation of the a 1 -adrenoceptors located
on 5-ht which would prevent the mirtazapine–paroxetine
combination from enhancing 5-ht neuronal firing activity
(fig. 2).
the results obtained in the dorsal hippocampus indicated
that the inhibition of 5-ht transporter by paroxetine was
not modified either by short- or long-term mirtazapine
administration. the assertion that the inhibitory effect of
5-ht on the firing activity of ca 3 pyramidal neurons is
mediated by the 5-ht 1a receptor subtype is supported by
the observation that the selective 5-ht 1a receptor antagonist way 100635 produced a marked reduction of the
effect of microiontophoretically-applied (figs. 4 and 5).
should there be a greater tonic activation of these postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors, one would expect their blockade by way 100635 to result in a greater enhancement of
the baseline firing activity of ca 3 pyramidal neurons.
way 100635 (25–100 mg / kg, i.v.) did not produce such
disinhibition in control rats (figs. 4–6). as previously
reported (haddjeri et al., 1998), this result suggests a lack
of a tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors in
the anesthetized untreated rats. interestingly, it was recently reported that way 100635 disinhibit ca 1 pyramidal
neurons firing activity, but not in 5-ht depleted, freely
moving rats (suzuki et al., 1999). in the present study, in
rats receiving paroxetine alone for 2 days, way 100635
did not induce any significant disinhibition of ca 3 pyramidal neurons. however, it did induce a significant disinhibition of the firing activity of these neurons in rats treated
with mirtazapine or paroxetine for 21 days. this is in
keeping with recent studies from our laboratory showing
that way 100635 produces a disinhibition of ca 3 pyramidal neurons following long-term administration of various
antidepressant treatments (haddjeri et al., 1998; rueter et
al., 1998). the enhanced tonic activation of postsynaptic
5-ht 1a receptors observed after the long-term treatment
with paroxetine can be accounted for by higher levels of
extracellular 5-ht in the hippocampus, as a result of the
recovery of the firing rate of 5-ht neurons associated with
the blockade of 5-ht reuptake. this assumption is consistent with previous studies showing increased extracellular concentrations of 5-ht in terminal brain areas (frontal
cortex, hypothalamus) after long-term ssri treatments
(bel and artigas, 1993; rutter et al., 1994). the enhanced
tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors observed
after the long-term treatment with mirtazapine can also be
explained by increased levels of 5-ht in the hippocampus
but, in contrast to that produced by paroxetine, it would
result from the increase of 5-ht firing activity and the
desensitization of a 2 -adrenergic heteroreceptors located on
terminal 5-ht neurons (haddjeri et al., 1997).
a striking finding was the marked enhanced tonic

fig. 5. integrated firing rate histograms of dorsal hippocampus ca 3 pyramidal neurons showing their responsiveness to microiontophoretic applications of 5-ht and to acute injections of cumulative

activation of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors observed after
the short-term treatment with the mirtazapine–paroxetine
combination while the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-ht
neurons was still significantly reduced (fig. 1). in addition,
the 2-day mirtazapine treatment, which did not modify
5-ht neuronal firing, also increased the disinhibitory
action of way 100635, albeit to a lesser extent than in the
combined treatment group. taken together, these results
suggest an enhanced 5-ht release in the dorsal hippocampus which is independent of the 5-ht neuronal firing rate
in the dorsal raphe nucleus (haddjeri et al., 1998; rueter et
al., 1998). another interesting finding was the greater tonic
activation of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors observed
following the long-term treatment with mirtazapine–paroxetine compared to each drug given alone (fig. 6). a higher
degree of 5-ht neuronal firing activity cannot account for
this observation as the mean firing rate of dorsal raphe
5-ht neurons in mirtazapine–paroxetine treated rats was
not increased (figs. 1 and 2). altogether, these results
suggest that the co-administration of mirtazapine with
paroxetine enhances the tonic activation of postsynaptic
5-ht 1a receptors due to the differential effects of the two
drugs on 5-ht neurotransmission in the ca 3 hippocampus: the blockade of terminal 5-ht transporters and
desensitization of 5-ht 1b autoreceptors by paroxetine
˜
(chaput et al., 1986, 1991; pineyro
et al., 1994) and with
the increased 5-ht release induced by mirtazapine through
the blockade of the terminal a 2 -adrenergic heteroreceptors
located on 5-ht terminals (haddjeri et al., 1997).

in conclusion, the present study provides evidence for
an earlier increase in 5-ht neurotransmission with mirtazapine than with a ssri. at least one ssri-controlled
trial supports this possibility of a more rapid onset of
action of mirtazapine (thompson, 1999). the combination
of mirtazapine and paroxetine induced a more rapid and
greater enhancement of 5-ht neurotransmission than
either drug given alone. in the light of previous evidence
of the key role of postsynaptic 5-ht 1a receptors site in the
therapeutic effect of antidepressant drugs, the co-administration of mirtazapine and paroxetine to patients presenting
major depression might accelerate the antidepressant response and / or might prove more effective than either drug
alone. a double-blind controlled trial is presently underway at our center to assess these possibilities.
