derived from preclinical gene profiling of model systems.
data extraction and synthesis: data from the prowess trial

evere sepsis is a devastating
disorder that results from a
complex host response to insult after infection (1–7). over
the last several years, a new understanding of sepsis pathophysiology has
emerged, focused on the tight interplay
and coupling of inflammation, microvascular coagulation, and endothelial cell

dent mechanisms in mononuclear and endothelial cells are reviewed. inhibition of apoptosis is used as an example of the
protective effect of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) on endothelial and
mononuclear cell dysfunction.
conclusions:  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) acts as a modulator
of nuclear factor-␬b to aid in the host immune response in
endothelium and monocytes. extrapolation of gene array findings
to explain apoptosis in endothelium and monocytes, coupled with
emerging preclinical reports, provides evidence to support the
role of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in modulating nuclear factor␬b. (crit care med 2002; 30[suppl.]:s288 –s293)

severe sepsis (9). this article reviews the
mechanistic role of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in modulating the inflammatory
component of severe sepsis. in particular,
we focus on its unique modulatory activities on the nuclear factor-␬b (nf-␬b)
inflammatory and apoptotic pathways in
the endothelium and mononuclear cells.

inflammatory cascade in
sepsis
the loss of homeostasis in severe sepsis
results in an uncontrolled cascade of inflammation, coagulation, and endothelial
cell dysfunction. in the early events leading
to severe sepsis, the host response results in
the activation of a number of systems
aimed at ridding the host of the infection.
the elucidation of cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor-␣, after insult initiates endothelial cell surface activation affecting a
number of pathways (e.g., oxidation, adhesion, cytokine release, apoptosis, and nitric
oxide production) and releasing  xxxg748xxx , which contributes further to inflammation through thrombin-induced activation
of endothelium, platelets, and vascular
smooth muscle (10). however, these responses can also directly damage the vas-

cular endothelium (11), resulting in neutrophil-endothelial cell adhesion, mononuclear cell adhesion, and  xxxg748xxx –
dependent activation of the coagulation
cascade (12, 13). further cycles exacerbate
proinflammatory mediator release, endothelial injury,  xxxg748xxx  expression, and
thrombin production, which lead to enhanced microvascular coagulation, endothelial cell dysfunction, and apoptosis. ultimately, microvascular function is compromised, which results in disseminated intravascular coagulation (dic) and microvascular thrombosis, decreased tissue perfusion and hypoxemia, and resultant organ
dysfunction and failure (14 –20). from this
cascade of successive activation events, endothelial dysfunction plays a central role in
modulating the tightly linked and interdependent inflammatory and thrombotic responses (21, 22).
in general, hemostatic stress relies on
an anticoagulant mechanism to maintain
homeostasis and prevent vascular thrombosis. the natural anticoagulant activity
of the protein c pathway, together with
that of antithrombin and  xxxg748xxx 
pathway inhibitor, normally functions to
maintain homeostasis. however, because
of the systemic inflammatory response in
crit care med 2002 vol. 30, no. 5 (suppl.)

sepsis, protein c is consumed and endothelial damage impairs both its activation
and its function via  xxxg2277xxx  and
the  xxxg1848xxx 
( xxxg1848xxx ) (13, 23–25). blocking dic by suppression of thrombin generation has become an accepted target in treating the
multiple organ dysfunction syndrome of
severe sepsis (8, 26). considering the
prominent role of microvascular coagulation in sepsis and  xxxg1847xxx ’s
major role in normal hemostasis, a key
mechanism for the benefit of drotrecogin
alfa (activated) is its direct antithrombotic activity, thereby preventing microvascular thrombosis, vascular congestion, and the resulting organ failure.
however, other antithrombotics and anticoagulants, although effective at inhibiting dic, have failed to show a reduction
in mortality in a number of animal studies (26 –28). coupled with the failure of
antithrombin and  xxxg748xxx  pathway
inhibitor in large phase 3 sepsis trials, it
would seem that correcting the coagulation defect in sepsis, although certainly
necessary, may not be sufficient to provide a mortality benefit. given these data,
there has been considerable speculation,
both historically and recently (29), that
the role of  xxxg1847xxx  in sepsis
pathophysiology and the efficacy of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in the treatment
of sepsis involve more than simply its
antithrombotic activity.

anti-inflammatory
activity—blocking
thrombin generation
the ability of  xxxg1847xxx  to inhibit thrombin generation has the potential
to reduce the proinflammatory activities of
thrombin, which are mediated by proteaseactivated receptor (par)-1, par-3, and
par-4. pars mediate thrombin-induced inflammation by generating signals that provide the intracellular, functional link between coagulation and inflammation at
sites of vascular injury, modulating platelet
and endothelial cell activation (10, 30, 31).
in particular,  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx  signals through protein kinase c, diacylglycerol, ca2⫹, and p38
mitogen-activated protein kinase. thrombin-mediated signals can also regulate nf␬b–mediated proinflammatory mediators,
including surface expression of the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and e selectin (32).  xxxg746xxx   xxxg1377xxx , initially
described on platelets, is also expressed on
the vessel wall (endothelium, smooth muscle, and fibroblasts), neuronal tissue, and
crit care med 2002 vol. 30, no. 5 (suppl.)

some leukocytes (t cells and natural killer
cells) (33).
in patients with sepsis and severe sepsis with dic, suppression of thrombin
generation by  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
may correlate with improved survival, as
suggested by results from the prowess
trial (9). prowess, the pivotal phase 3
trial of patients with severe sepsis treated
with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated), used biomarkers of thrombin generation to detect inactivation of factors va and viiia.
compared to placebo, parallel improvements in thrombin-related biomarkers in
the treated group included reduction of
thrombin-antithrombin complexes, ddimer levels, and the profibrinolytic
marker, plasminogen activator inhibitor
type-1 (34). moreover, an analysis of the
subset of patients with overt dic within
the trial supports the above thrombotic
marker results. in a post hoc analysis of
this small group of patients (15%), there
was an apparent survival advantage (overt
dic vs. nonovert dic) that did not occur
at the expense of more serious adverse
bleeding events (35). overall, the clinical
data confirm the inhibition of thrombin
generation by  xxxd1948xxx  (activated), and this reduction in thrombin at the
vessel wall is likely to be an important
component of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)’s anti-inflammatory activity via reduced thrombin-mediated par cleavage.

anti-inflammatory
activity—thrombinindependent mechanisms
although direct anti-inflammatory effects of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) are
less well defined clinically, the prowess
trial provided direct evidence for modulation of the inflammatory response by
showing a significant reduction in the
levels of interleukin-6 (9). during the last
decade, preclinical evidence has been accumulating to support direct antiinflammatory properties of  xxxg1847xxx  and modulatory activity on cellular
functions (8, 28, 36 – 40). for example,
 xxxg1847xxx  has been shown to
inhibit the generation of cytokines such
as interleukin-1, to uncouple the interaction of lipopolysaccharide with monocyte
cd14, to suppress surface  xxxg748xxx , to
modulate  xxxg1409xxx , and to selectively inhibit the
responses of human mononuclear phagocytes to lipopolysaccharide, interferon-␥,
and  xxxd2925xxx  (36, 41– 46). activated
protein c has been shown to inhibit li-

popolysaccharide-induced translocation
of nf-␬b in monocytes at relatively high
concentrations (47) and to inhibit leukocyte cell adhesion (48). activated protein
c suppression of monocyte ca2⫹ flux and
nf-␬b may be related to a specific monocyte  xxxg1847xxx  receptor (49).
 xxxg1847xxx  has also been shown
to attenuate endotoxin-induced pulmonary vascular injury by inhibiting activated leukocytes (50) and to inhibit leukocyte activation after renal injury in rat
models (51). however, until recently,
there was little evidence that activated
protein c modulated endothelial cell
function.
to investigate the direct effects of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) on endothelial
function, we employed gene array transcript profiling of messenger rna
(mrna) from primary cultured human
umbilical vein endothelial cells exposed
to  xxxd1948xxx  (activated). these experiments, performed in the absence of
thrombin, provided evidence for direct
modulation of genes in proinflammatory
and apoptotic pathways (52). in particular, we identified a class of genes regulated by nf-␬b and found that  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) directly modulated the
p50/ xxxg799xxx   xxxg1560xxx  subunits of the nf-␬b complex.
 xxxd1948xxx  (activated) also reduced
binding of the p65 subunit of nf-␬b to
dna in the nuclear extracts (fig. 1).
moreover, this regulation at the gene
level had the functional consequence of
blocking mononuclear cell adhesion to
activated endothelial cells by suppressing
cell adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule, and e selectin (fig. 2).
further analysis of gene transcript profiles has identified a set of immune response modulating genes whose activation is suppressed by  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) (table 1). experiments determining functional correlates of these immune-regulating genes are in progress.
in addition to the effect of drotrecogin
alfa (activated) on downstream mediation
of inflammation, gene profiling results
also showed a clustering of transcripts
indicating regulation of pathways promoting anti-apoptosis and cell survival
(52).  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) upregulated anti-apoptotic mrna transcripts, survivin (inhibitor of apoptosis
protein), human a1 bcl-2 homolog, an
inhibitor of ␬b-like molecule, and tumor
necrosis factor-␣–activated a20, which
recently was shown to be critical in regulating  xxxg2296xxx -␣–induced
s289

effects and cell death responses in knockout experiments (53).  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) also suppressed the apoptosisassociated genes  xxxg323xxx  and trmp-2
(54, 55). however, of more importance,
these changes in the apoptosis pathway
induced by  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
resulted in protection of endothelial cells
from induction of apoptosis by potent
mediators (52). these results are significant in light of growing evidence for the
role of apoptosis in systemic inflammatory response and sepsis (56 –58), and
studies in which proinflammatory effects—including oxidation,  xxxd2738xxx 
production, enhanced adhesion, and cytokine production—are intimately linked
to endothelial apoptosis (57). moreover,
apoptotic endothelium is highly proco-

amplification of the coagulation defect in
sepsis.
the direct cell-modulatory effects of
 xxxg1847xxx  action are suspected
to involve  xxxg1848xxx .  xxxg1848xxx  belongs to the
major histocompatibility complex cd1/
mhc class 1 family (60, 61) and plays a
key role in the activation of protein c
(28). recently, it has been shown to be
important in survival in a baboon model
of sepsis (62).  xxxg1848xxx  binds both activated
protein c and protein c.  xxxg1848xxx  regulates
the protein c anticoagulant pathway by
binding protein c and augmenting protein c activation by the thrombinthrombomodulin complex. binding of  xxxg1847xxx  may cause translocation
of the receptor– xxxg1847xxx  complex to the nucleus (63). our preliminary
results suggest that  xxxg1847xxx 
may also mediate an intracellular signaling event. further study is needed to de-

the level of e selectin on tnf-treated human
endothelial cells by flow cytometry (52).

termine the exact role of  xxxg1848xxx  in the
observed anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic signaling pathway.
the importance of  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated)–mediated regulation of nf-␬b
deserves additional comment. cytokine
activation in severe sepsis has been a
prominent target in attempts to treat this
complex disease state (2, 11), and many
cell activating and inflammatory insults
mediate their effects through nf-␬b.
nf-␬b activates pathways related to oxidation, adhesion, cytokine release, apoptosis, and  xxxd2738xxx  production (64,
65). in the endothelium, nf-␬b is arguably the most important inflammatory
signal. however, the indirect approach of
modulating nf-␬b by blocking cytokines
may not be as effective as directly suppressing levels of nf-␬b. a recent clinical
report has shown the suppressive effect of
corticosteroid therapy on nf-␬b in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in late,
refractory septic shock (66). however,
blocking inflammation through nf-␬b
with high-dose corticosteroids in early
sepsis may be detrimental, and the use of
lower dose steroids in late, refractory septic shock remains controversial.
further investigation of the genes that
are expressed in the endothelium and
other blood leukocytes may give a clue as
to the nf-␬b–related immune modulating effects of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated).
suppression of monocyte nf-␬b has been
suggested and in general would be expected to parallel that found in the endothelium (47). using surface  xxxg166xxx 
staining and intracellular caspase-3 staining, an anti-apoptotic effect was seen
with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) in the
u937 monocyte cell line exposed to  xxxd3241xxx  (fig. 3). this functional suppression of  xxxd3241xxx -induced apoptosis by  xxxd1948xxx  (activated)
suggests an immunomodulatory effect

effect is seen at concentrations of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) very close to

further work is in progress to elucidate
the specific mechanism underlying this
anti-apoptotic effect.
the link to nf-␬b suggested in the
above in vitro experiments has begun to
emerge in several experimental animal
reports. review of these preclinical animal models coupled with the clinical
findings seen in patients with severe sepsis may provide support for the antiinflammatory hypothesis of nf-␬b suppression proposed for  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated). a recent murine model of focal, ischemic stroke provided evidence to
support the neuroprotective effects of  xxxg1847xxx  (67). in this model of
ischemia,  xxxg1847xxx  reduced infarct size and brain edema, suppressed
murine endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and reduced myeloperoxidase staining in tissue sections of parenchymal brain. of note, administration

duction in lung  xxxd2738xxx  and inducible
 xxxd2738xxx  synthase mrna were detected. in a human model of cardiac bypass surgery, postischemic protein c activation was associated with decreased
neutrophil tissue sequestration in the
coronary vessels and an elevated activated
protein c/protein c ratio after declamping. this suggests that activated protein
c produced the anti-inflammatory effect
(reduced myeloperoxidase) in myocardium (69). these studies, and the global
reduction of interleukin-6 found in the
prowess trial, are early data supporting
nf-␬b suppression by activated protein
c. however, additional preclinical and
clinical research is required to define further the anti-inflammatory mechanisms
of  xxxg1847xxx  in sepsis patients.

summary and conclusions
the proposed anti-inflammatory impact of  xxxg1847xxx -modulation of
nf-␬b is shown in figure 4. the antithetical roles of thrombin (procoagulant
and proinflammatory) and  xxxg1847xxx  (antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory) define extracellular regulation
and suggest intracellular regulation, possibly signaling crosstalk, to help keep in
check the inflammatory influences on
both endothelium and monocytes. both
cell types express receptors for activated
protein c and both utilize the inflammas292

tory regulator nf-␬b. in vitro elucidation
of the mechanism of action of activated
protein c may help better specify the
treatment strategy for  xxxd1948xxx 
(activated) and define other host antiinflammatory mechanisms. overall,
nf-␬b could be considered an important
additional target for intervention in patients with sepsis, although inhibition
may need to be restricted to early in the
course of the pathophysiology, bearing in
mind the possible roles of nf-␬b in the
resolution of inflammation (70). the
thrombin-independent anti-inflammatory mechanisms seen in vitro with  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) may reflect some
of the clinical findings seen in treated
patients. beyond adhesion and apoptosis,
other nf-␬b–regulated events require investigation— both in vitro and in vivo—
throughout all components of the host immune response to provide further support
for the nf-␬b–modulating mechanism of
action of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated).
the ability of  xxxg1847xxx  to suppress proinflammatory pathways and cellular survival mechanisms at the endothelialmononuclear cell interface suggests a
complex adaptive response at the vessel
wall to protect the organism from vascular
insult and to prolong endothelial, cellular,
and organ survival. overall, the protein c
pathway plays a unique role in modulating
vascular function. as protein c is consumed in sepsis, this mechanism is suppressed and the ability to adapt is significantly inhibited. thus, failure of
endothelial and mononuclear cell function
in severe inflammatory processes without
the immunomodulatory influences of  xxxg1847xxx  may help explain the adverse outcomes of sepsis patients with protein c deficiency. however, the favorable
outcomes seen in patients receiving pharmacologic doses of  xxxd1948xxx  (activated) therapy may depend on both the
thrombin-dependent anti-inflammatory
mechanisms and the thrombin-independent anti-inflammatory mechanisms.
