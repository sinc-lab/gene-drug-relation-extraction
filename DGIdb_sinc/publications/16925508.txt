 xxxd3195xxx  is an antipsychotic drug with affinity for dopamine d2, serotonin
 xxxg1113xxx  and  xxxg1115xxx , and  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoreceptors. preclinical studies suggest that
 xxxd3195xxx  acts preferentially on limbic and cortical dopaminergic neurons
and clinical trials have confirmed that  xxxd3195xxx  is effective at a low
dopamine d2 occupancy level. the active substance has a long half-life. oral
administration once daily yields highly stable plasma levels. these features
may explain the clinically observed low frequency of extrapyramidal side
effects, including tardive dyskinesia. in contrast to most antipsychotics,  xxxd3195xxx  seems to be void of sedative effects. however, although not strictly
proven by objective neuropsychological tests, this asset of  xxxd3195xxx  does not
add to the cognitive problems inherent in schizophrenia. administration of
 xxxd3195xxx  is more often associated with prolongation of qtc compared with
most other currently used antipsychotics. however, large cohort analyses do
not suggest that all-cause mortality is higher with  xxxd3195xxx  than with, for
example, risperidone or olanzapine. the effective antipsychotic dose range
of  xxxd3195xxx  is 12 – 20 mg/day, with small variations among patients. the frequency of most adverse events, for example extrapyramidal symptoms and
somnolence, with such a dose does not differ from placebo. three side effects
have been more common than with placebo/haloperidol in short-term studies: weight gain, rinithis and a decreased ejaculation volume. two
head-to-head comparisons (one in treatment-resistant patients) of  xxxd3195xxx 
and risperidone showed equivalent effects on positive symptoms. for negative symptoms, one study obtained equivalent effects and one a superior
effect of  xxxd3195xxx .  xxxd3195xxx  should not be used as first-line treatment for
first-episode patients with schizophrenia because of the qtc prolongation. it
has a side-effect profile that makes it an interesting alternative for many
patients who do not respond well to the initial choice of antipsychotic drug.

introduction

schizophrenia is a disabling condition that affects ∼ 1% of the population worldwide.
lifetime risk is 0.5 – 1.5%, with small differences across cultures/populations [1-3].
women seem to have a somewhat smaller risk of becoming ill, and are less socially
disabled if affected [4]. the onset of the illness is typically in young adulthood; earlier for men, later for women. a majority of those affected display a chronic course,
with relapses in psychotic episodes, cognitive reduction, social decline, high morbidity and mortality and poor quality of life [5,6]. life expectancy for schizophrenia is decreasing, in contrast to an increasing life expectancy in the general
population. with respect to economic burden, 1.5 – 3.5% of annual gross
national healthcare costs in both european and non-european countries are spent
on schizophrenia [7-11], making it the most costly diagnosis of all.
one of the cornerstones in the treatment of schizophrenia is antipsychotic drugs.
the first one, chlorpromazine, was unexpectedly found to be dramatically effective in

the symptoms of schizophrenia in the early 1950s [12], although
it was soon found to display many unwanted side effects.
since then, many new compounds with antipsychotic
properties have been developed. depot preparations were
introduced in the 1960s, addressing drug adherence as well as
practicality issues (for patients who prefer not to medicate on
an every-day basis). however, current treatment principles
and the range of compounds that are available have not solved
the clinical problem: there are many unmet clinical needs [13].

was denoted ‘cognitive’. green performed the first meta-analysis of the impact of cognition on social outcome [22], and
detailed his findings in later publications. a consequent
upsurge of interest in cognition has fuelled a large number of
studies into this aspect of schizophrenia in recent years. it can
now be concluded that the functional deficits in schizophrenia, which to a large extent reflect cognitive impairment,
represent perhaps the major problem of the illness.

disease characteristics

today, schizophrenia is regarded as an illness characterised by
symptoms belonging to four dimensions: positive, negative,
cognitive and affective. drug treatment does not affect all of
these dimensions equally well. in addition to the problem of
limited symptom control, drugs have side effects that cause
suffering, as well as compromised function.
initially, cognitive impairment was regarded as the core problem of schizophrenia reflected in the early terminology of two
french psychiatrists around 1840, magnan and morel [14], who
described the illness as a precocious dementia. the german
psychiatrist kraepelin, who was active in the field 50 years later,
continued this tradition and underlined the poor prognosis
aspect of the illness [15]. viewed in this way, schizophrenia is a
dementia disorder with associated additional symptoms. in
contrast, two other german-speaking psychiatrists, bleuler [16]
and schneider [17], regarded the psychotic symptoms as the key
signature of the illness. freud’s pupil, mayer, influential in the
us, switzerland and finland [18], placed further emphasis on
this perspective, widening the diagnosis of schizophrenia to
conditions with any productive psychotic symptoms. the original conception of schizophrenia as a dementia disorder was
pushed further still into the background by the introduction of
drugs that drastically reduced psychotic symptoms, of the type
that today are referred to as ‘positive’ or ‘productive’. this
cemented the focus on such symptoms, in spite of the fact that
negative and cognitive symptoms were little affected by such
pharmacological treatment.
the marked diagnostic differences among cultures/countries were not regarded as a large problem by the scientific
psychiatric community before the end of the 1960s. the first
outline of a unified conceptualisation of the illness, the
research diagnostic criteria of the mid-1970s, represents a
small step back to the kraepelinian view, by reintroducing a
duration criterion and underlining the importance of negative
symptoms and social dysfunction for the diagnosis. however,
the bleuler/schneider view prevailed for most of the
remaining years of the 20th century.
two sets of innovative publications changed this view. the
positive and negative syndrome scale (panss) was initially
designed to assess two subsyndromes of schizophrenia defined
in the 1970s. factor analyses of panss by kay and sevy [19],
and later by two other groups in the mid 1990s [20,21], verified
that there were five dimensions of symptoms, of which one

identification of the problems discussed above has naturally led
to a search for cognitive remediation among patients with schizophrenia, and particularly for antipsychotic compounds that
also improve cognition. desired qualities are advantageous
effects on positive and affective symptoms, amelioration of
negative symptoms and as few and mild side effects as possible.
the introduction of several atypical antipsychotic compounds in recent decades represents a substantial advance in the
treatment of schizophrenia. studies suggest that some of these
compounds, particularly clozapine, may be effective for many
treatment-resistant patients. furthermore, side effects tend to
be milder and do not seem to include serious extrapyramidal
effects [23,24]. thus, the superiority of the new drugs compared
with the older ones (often called neuroleptics or first-generation
antipsychotics) seems to rest on two pillars: a superior effect on
key symptoms and less pronounced side effects. this, in turn,
may result in better treatment compliance and hence a still better outcome. poor drug adherence is a major problem in the
treatment of schizophrenia, as evidenced by, for example, the
very disappointing data coming out from the large catie
study, where almost 75% of the patients discontinued their
original treatment within 1 year [25]. however, other studies
report much higher figures for compliance [26]. it is of utmost
clinical importance to identify factors that promote patient
cooperation and drug adherence and to implement successful
procedures into the clinical day-to-day work.
many studies suggest that the new compounds are also superior with respect to negative symptoms; however, the effect on
negative symptoms is much less dramatic than the effect on
positive ones. therefore, differences in efficacy among different
antipsychotic drugs are much more difficult to demonstrate. as
clinicians, the authors would welcome new compounds with a
distinct effect on negative symptoms; however, to the authors’
knowledge, a compound with such effects has yet to be identified. for the time being, the aim should be to first improve negative symptoms to a small degree, by a careful individualised
matching of individuals and available drugs [13]. this may still
be important for outcome – even a moderate reduction of negative symptoms may be a decisive factor that allows other treatment components to work, such as psychosocial training and
stress inoculation methods.
the same line of reasoning can be applied to cognitive
functions. if impaired cognitive functions such as slowness

lindström & levander

(the most consistent predictor of poor outcome in green’s
original meta-analysis [22]), attention and working memory
problems, and executive functions can be improved, a patient
with schizophrenia has a much better chance to live independently and benefit from social interactions and psychological treatment methods. the degree of effect of drug
treatment on cognitive functions is much smaller than is ideal
and, for that reason (restriction of range), the same difficulties
in demonstrating differences among various antipsychotic
drugs as for negative symptoms occur. the currently available
research body, as reviewed in a series of meta-analyses [27-32],
does not allow any firm conclusions to be deduced as to the
superiority of one drug over another [24].
the methods to assess cognition stem from two traditions:
a psychometric approach exemplified by the wechsler adult
intelligence scale (wais) battery, and an experimental one,
for example, the holzman studies of the 1970s of smooth
pursuit eye-movement deficits in schizophrenics and
first-degree relatives [33]. many of the wais-type tests do not
reflect the typical profile of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and are not suited for designs for repeated measures.
methods of the experimental tradition were designed to assess
narrow aspects of cognition and rarely comprise comprehensive batteries. such tests always include a large share of
test-specific variance of doubtful ecological significance.
rephrased simply, it is not known if a test-verified improvement matters in daily life. some of these methods can be used
in repeated testing (the most powerful experimental design),
but most of them, such as the wisconsin card sorting test
and towers of london (claimed to be ‘executive’ tests), cannot. in summary, the ideal would be strong, broad assessment
instruments, tailor-made for good sensitivity and specificity
with respect to the schizophrenia impairment profile, and
with proven ecological relevance. these shortcomings of the
current scientific methodology are recognised within the
national institute of mental health – measurement and
treatment research to improve cognition in schizophrenia
(nimh-matrics) group and work is being undertaken to
improve this [34]. however, if really effective compounds were
available that improved cognition as dramatically as the current antipsychotic drugs improve productive psychotic symptoms, this cognitive improvement would certainly be
detected, even using the current nonoptimal methods. thus,
new compounds with marked positive effects on cognition
must be awaited, or ways to prevent the development of
cognitive impairment must be sought [35].
4.

side effects of drug treatment

in the previous section, disease characteristics (symptoms) and
the symptom-ameliorating effects that drugs would ideally
have were the focus. all symptom-reducing compounds also
have side effects, specifically, unwanted effects. the first-generation drugs induced more side effects than modern ones,
partly by being active on many receptor populations; that is,

they display poor specificity compared with those implicated
in schizophrenia. one common mechanism of side-effect
induction is the dose-related modifying effect on neurotransmission that all antipsychotic drugs have. when the drug is
eliminated, the side effect vanishes. but there are other mechanisms, up- or downregulation of receptor populations in
response to the drug effect, which take a longer time to subside, and actual damage to receptors or systems may occur,
which is irreversible. some side effects are not receptor mediated, for example, immunological side effects, some of which
can be serious or life-threatening. side effects of both kinds
include, for example, sedation, inhibition of ejaculation, dry
mouth, akathisia, parkinsonism, dystonia, dyskinesia and an
increase in serum prolactin levels. long-term treatment with
typical antipsychotics may trigger other mechanisms with
extrapyramidal, as well as cognitive, manifestations
during the last couple of years, there has been a discussion
concerning how first-generation antipsychotics in low doses
compare with second-generation ones, with respect to
extrapyramidal side effects. in a systematic review, leucht
et al. [36] identified 31 studies including a total of 2320 participants. of atypical drugs, only clozapine was associated with
significantly fewer eps and better efficacy than low-potency
first-generation drugs. clinically, clozapine-treated patients
have few, if any, eps. its use is limited by other side effects,
such as sedation, weight gain and immunological reactions.
the most serious and still common extrapyramidal side
effect is tardive dyskinesia (td), a syndrome of abnormal
movements that often appears after several years of treatment
with antipsychotic drugs. the earliest sign of td is often
mild movements of the tongue, chewing, licking or smacking
movements. later, the patient develops choreiform movements of the hands, fingers and arms [37]. spontanous dyskinetic movements have been reported in never-medicated
patients since the days of kraepelin [15], suggesting that such
motor (catatonic) symptoms may be part of the psychotic disease. for drugs, the dominant hypothesis claims that the syndrome is caused by drug induction of dopamine receptor
supersensitivity [38,39].
there is no specific treatment for td [37]. discontinuation of antipsychotics as soon as signs emerge may help, but
this approach is not always possible because of exacerbation
of psychotic symptoms. switching to a second-generation
drug is one possibility if the patient has been treated with a
first-generation drug. clozapine may then be the drug of
choice because of its low d2 occupancy concurrent with full
antipsychotic effect [39-42]. again, its side effect profile makes
it a poor choice for many patients. then experts have to look
for compounds that have similar d2 occupancy characteristics;
namely, olanzapine and  xxxd3195xxx . recent empirical studies
suggest that a switch to quetiapine [43] and to  xxxd3195xxx  [44]
ameliorates td. a somewhat different view of td was
obtained in a recent 5-year, longitudinal study [37]. over the
620 patient-years of exposure from study start to end,
5 patients developed td and 14 became free of td, essentially

 xxxd3195xxx : efficacy and safety in schizophrenia

without any relation to drug or dose. these data are in line with
kraepelin’s observations that td can be a motor manifestation
of schizophrenia and may wax and wane over the years [15].
sedation is a common side effect of antipsychotic drugs,
mediated by effects on different receptor populations. over
100 years of psychological studies demonstrate that sedation
causes broad cognitive impairment. drugs that are sedative can
be expected to augment an already present cognitive impairment; nonsedative drugs should be superior in this respect.
anticholinergics have well-documented adverse effects on
memory functions [45,46]. if treatment with an antipsychotic
compound results in side effects that must be controlled by additional anticholinergic drugs, memory problems inherent in
schizophrenia will likely become worse still. thus, freedom of
extrapyramidal side effects is advantageous, because then patients
can manage their symptoms without anticholinergic drugs.
in summary, the development of second-generation antipsychotics was driven by two aims: improved effect on target
symptom dimensions, ideally by intervening in pathogenetic
mechanisms, and fewer side effects. a global statement with
respect to success/failure would be that the new compounds
are at least as effective as the first-generation ones, with
respect to positive symptoms, and one compound, clozapine,
is definitely superior. with respect to negative and cognitive
symptoms, more caution must be exercised, but there are
good reasons to conclude that the new antipsychotics are generally better [13]. the most notable difference is in the side
effects. the atypical antipsychotics are definitely superior in a
clinically relevant way [47].
5.

health economy aspects

an important issue in many countries with limited economic
resources to invest in public healthcare of psychiatric patients
is the costs of old versus new antipsychotic drugs. treatment
costs for schizophrenia are high, even considering the fact that
it is often assigned a low priority by politicians compared with
somatic disorders [48-51]. the total cost of a disease is often
subdivided into direct (expenditures) and indirect costs (lost
productivity and family burden). in contrast to most other
serious disorders, indirect costs are more than twice as high as
the direct costs of schizophrenia [9]. viewed in this way, the
cost of drug treatment is low, in the range of 1 – 5% of the
total costs. a health economy analysis using the markov
method showed that all atypical antipsychotics analysed
( xxxd3195xxx , olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole) were
clinically superior compared with haloperidol [52].
6.

 xxxd3195xxx  was withdrawn from the market in 1998 when the
uk database adverse drug reactions online information
tracking (adroit) reported that the rate of fatal arryhthmias or sudden death was almost 10-times greater for
 xxxd3195xxx  than for olanzapine and risperidone (7.5 versus
0.8 – 0.9%). at that time, it was well known that  xxxd3195xxx 
was associated with a higher frequency of qt-interval prolongation than other second-generation drugs. with such properties, it could not be excluded that there was an increased risk
of cardiovascular adverse events.
prolongation of qtc
many antipsychotic drugs produce qt-interval prolongation
on ecg. thioridazine has the most pronounced effect, followed by  xxxd2956xxx ,  xxxd3195xxx  and ziprazidone. blockade of
the human cardiac k+ channel controlled by the herg gene
is a candidate mechanism for this effect [55]. prolongation of
the qtc interval could be seen as a surrogate marker for the
ability to cause torsades de pointes (tdp), a polymorphic ventricular arrhytmia that can progress to ventricular fibrillation
and sudden death. in individual patients, an absolute qtc
interval of > 500 ms or an increase of 60 ms from baseline is
regarded as a risk signal of tpd. however, tdp can occur
with lower qtc values or changes [56]. the degree of qtc
prolongation is dose dependent. arrhythmias are more likely
to occur if a drug-induced qtc prolongation coexists with
other risk factors, such as congenital long qt syndromes,
heart failure, bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, drug overdose, female sex, old age, hepatic or renal impairment and
slow metabolism [56].
the concern regarding a relationship between qtc prolongation, tdp and sudden death applies to a wide range of drugs,
not only antipsychotics, and has lead to withdrawal or restricted
labelling.  xxxd1945xxx  (an antipsychotic drug) was withdrawn for
this reason. in 2005, restrictions were imposed on prescriptions
of thioridazine and  xxxd2956xxx , drugs that will be withdrawn in
the near future. after the initial alarm for  xxxd3195xxx  and its consequent removal by the manufacturer from the market in 1998,
new data, as well as nonclinical evidence, suggested that the
risk/benefit profile of the compound did not motivate a permanent withdrawal. the suspension was lifted in 2002 for postmarketing surveillance studies (scop). large epidemiological
studies revealed no increase in overall or cardiac mortality. based
on an evaluation by the committee for human medicinal products the european commission recommended lifting the marketing restrictions on  xxxd3195xxx  in 2005. the regulatory
agencies in many countries have now implemented the approval
of  xxxd3195xxx  on a national level [101].

indications and principles of drug

 xxxd3195xxx  is a second-generation antipsychotic drug that is
nonsedative and shows a lower incidence of extrapyramidal
side effects at clinically effective doses than first-generation
compounds. it also compares favourably with some other
second-generation compounds, such as risperidone [53,54].
1828

the only indication for first-generation antipsychotic drugs is
schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like disorders. since the
introduction of chlorpromazine in 1952, typical antipsychotics

have been used beyond this indication, in affective and personality disorders, for the treatment of insomnia and anxiety,
in old age as sedatives, for abusers and in delirium tremens.
some second-generation antipsychotics have received additional indications: acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar mania and depression and psychoses of the elderly and/or
demented. still, other indications will probably surface in the
coming years.
in the 1950s, clinicians had a very limited choice of antipsychotic drugs. today, the situation is much more complex. in
many countries, economy is a significant factor: even if second-generation compounds are superior in some ways, do they
justify the marked increase in cost, sometimes carried by the
national health system, sometimes by the individual patient and
her/his family? it should be noted that the costs for the most
expensive compounds are clearly < 10% of the total costs for
treatment. thus, a switch to a low-cost first-generation drug
does not generate much money that can be invested in other
treatment modalities, for example social skills training.
clinical experience over 50 years suggests very clearly that
patients with schizophrenia are individuals who react differently to different drugs. data on a group level, such as those
produced for clinically homogenous groups in phase iii clinical studies, and for a wider range of patients in naturalistic
phase iv studies, provide course guidelines. it is the task of
the experienced and skilled clinician, in cooperation with the
patient, to find the optimal drug treatment for that specific
person in that specific context.
a good clinician is scientifically updated. that means, for
example, that they are aware that poor drug treatment adherence is very common and that noncompliance is likely the leading cause of suicide in schizophrenia [57] and homicide
committed by schizophrenic patients [58]. on a less dramatic
level, it is known that risperidone, currently the most prescribed
antipsychotic compound in the nordic countries, is associated
with dose-related eps, medium weight gain and a marked, but
tapering, increase in prolactin levels that does not seem to be
significant with respect to side effects [59,60]. olanzapine is associated with almost no eps at lower doses, but with a considerable weight gain among some patients and a consequent risk
increase for diabetes and cardiovascular complications. clozapine is also diabetogenic, produces marked sedation, hypersalivation, eeg abnormalities and requires white blood cell
monitoring due to the risk of agranulocytosis. quetiapine demosntrates no more eps than placebo, and causes moderate sedation and some weight gain.  xxxd221xxx  is the first and only
agent in its class, characterised by being a partial dopamine
d2-receptor agonist. clinical experience of  xxxd221xxx  is still
limited, but so far, the impression is that it induces few eps,
mild sedation, some agitation and seems to have only limited
effect on weight gain [13]. some clinicians report that the effect
on positive symptoms is less pronounced than that of other
antipsychotic compounds, but at present this is anecdotal information. in the long term, the collected anecdotal information
of many clinicians will reach the level of a statement along the

lines of ‘clinical experience of  xxxd221xxx  suggests....’, but this is
yet to be reached.
to summarise, drug treatment of schizophrenia should be
individualised and address the needs of the patient.  xxxd3195xxx 
has a profile of effects that may fit some patients, in particular
the freedom of sedative effects, the long half-life (should yield
a nonfluctuating effect on the target receptor populations)
and the benign eps profile.
8.

 xxxd3195xxx : an overview of basic facts

8.1 chemistry

 xxxd3195xxx  is a phenylindole derivative that has affinity for
dopamine d2 receptors, serotonin 5-ht2 receptors and
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adenoreceptors [61]. its chemical name is 1-(2-4(5-chloro-1(4flouorphenyl)-1h-indol-3-yl)-1-piperidinyl)ethyl-2-imidazolidinone.
pharmacodynamics
 xxxd3195xxx  acts by selective inhibition of dopamine d2 receptors in the mesolimbic system and ventral tegmental area and
by inhibition of cns serotonin 5-ht2 receptors and
 xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoreceptors [62]. antagonism of the dopaminergic
neurons in the ventral tegmental area mediate the antipsychotic effect, and antagonism of the dopaminergic neurons in
the nigrostriatum has the potential to cause eps.
in vitro studies have demonstrated that  xxxd3195xxx  has a
high affinity for dopamine d2 receptors,  xxxg1113xxx  and  xxxg1115xxx 
receptors and  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenoreceptors, but also an ability to be an
 xxxd1422xxx  at the site of  xxxg1115xxx  receptors and reduce agonist binding to these receptors (all antipsychotics with
 xxxg1115xxx  affinity have been shown to be inverse agonists,
therefore caution must be taken when drawing conclusions
from these observations [63,64]. the inverse agonism may be
the reason why  xxxd3195xxx  can improve negative symptoms in
schizophrenia [63]. single photon emission computed tomography (spect) studies show that the  xxxd3195xxx  occupancy of
striatal d2 receptors at equipotent antipsychotic doses were
significantly lower compared with haloperidol, lower or similar compared with risperidone and higher compared with
clozapine and olanzapine [65-67].
in vitro studies verify that  xxxd3195xxx  prolongs the qtc
interval via blockade of potassium current, but in vivo animal
data also suggests that  xxxd3195xxx  has properties that may protect against ventricular arrhythmias. the mechanisms may be
blockade of sodium and calcium ion channels or blockade of
a1-adrenoceptors [68], which may explain why  xxxd3195xxx  does
not trigger early after-depolarisations or proarrhythmia in cardiac rabbit purkinje fibre or heterogeneity of repolarisation in
rabbit heart [69]. in animal models, no cases of tdp occurred
at therapeutic plasma concentrations [70].

 xxxd3195xxx : efficacy and safety in schizophrenia

plasma concentration is reached after ∼ 10 h [71-74].  xxxd3195xxx  is
99.5% bound to plasma proteins and the penetration over the
blood–brain barrier is good. oral  xxxd3195xxx  can be administrated concurrently with food. its half-life is 3 days (53 – 102 h
in single- and multiple-dose studies [72]). the compound is
metabolised in the liver by cyp2d6 and -3a.  xxxd3195xxx  then
undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism to dehydrosertindole
(via oxidation) and norsertindole (via n-dealkylation). these
two main metabolites do not seem to have any important clinical activity [75,76]. individuals with reduced cyp2d6 metabolism have a 33 – 50% clearance of  xxxd3195xxx . co-medication
with psychotropic drugs, such as fluoxetine or paroxetine, may
increase the  xxxd3195xxx  serum level, whereas comedication with
carbamazepine and phenytoin may decrease the level. pharmacokinetics do not seem to be significantly affected by age, sex,
race or renal impairment. however, hepatic impairment may
require recalculation of dosages [102].
clinical efficacy
the efficacy of  xxxd3195xxx  has been examined in six randomised, double-blind, multi-centre trials, one placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study, three comparisons with
haloperidol and two comparisons with risperidone.  xxxd3195xxx 
was proven to be effective in the treatment of neuroleptic-responsive schizophrenic patients and in the placebo-controlled,
dose-ranging
study.
significantly
greater
improvements from baseline in the brief psychiatric rating
scale (bprs) and the panss [77] total scores were shown for
patients treated with  xxxd3195xxx  20 mg/day compared with
placebo [78]. in the three trials for which  xxxd3195xxx  was compared with haloperidol, significant improvement measured
with bprs and panss were seen for both  xxxd3195xxx  and
haloperidol compared with placebo after 8 weeks of
treatment [79-81]. two head-to-head comparisons with risperidone showed that  xxxd3195xxx  was at least as effective as risperidone [54,82]. with respect to negative symptoms, one study
showed no difference between compounds [82] and another
showed a significant difference in favour of  xxxd3195xxx  [54].
unlike some other antipsychotic drugs,  xxxd3195xxx  has not
been associated with cognitive impairment and may actually
improve cognitive function [61,83]. this may reflect the fact
that  xxxd3195xxx  is void of sedative effects. however, the documentation from the available studies is weak and comparisons
are difficult because of the problem of restriction of range.
the clinically effective dose range is 12 – 20 mg/day; however, some patients may require slightly more (24 mg/day).
administration is once daily; the initial dose is 4 mg/day,
increasing by 4 mg over 4 – 5 days to 12 – 20 mg, depending
upon clinical response. a slower dose increase is
recommended in elderly patients because of the risk of
postural hypotension.

safety and tolerability
in a double-blind, controlled study of  xxxd3195xxx  versus
risperidone, both compounds were well tolerated [54]. the
8.5

1830

total number of adverse events was similar in both groups:
87% in the  xxxd3195xxx  group and 81% in the risperidone
group reported at least one adverse event. significantly, more
 xxxd3195xxx -treated patients displayed qt prolongation and
also reported smaller ejaculation volumes than risperidone-treated patients. sedation was uncommon in both
groups. fewer  xxxd3195xxx  patients reported eps-related side
effects. the most common side effects of  xxxd3195xxx  in phase
ii and iii clinical studies were nasal congestion, reduced ejaculatory volume, dizziness and dry mouth. these adverse
events did not seem to be dose dependent. adrenergic side
effects, such as postural hypotension and sinus tachycardia, if
present, diminish with continued therapy. the prolactin levels
in patients receiving  xxxd3195xxx  remained within normal limits, both in short-term studies and during long-term treatment (1 year), and some patients show a rise in serum
glutamic pyruvic transaminase/ xxxg941xxx  levels
[76]. a clinically relevant increase of serum glucose was
observed in 4% of  xxxd3195xxx -treated patients [83]. in one trial,
there was a mean increase in plasma cholesterol levels [77].
with respect to weight change, long-term studies of  xxxd3195xxx 
show an increase of the body mass by ∼ 5%[102], which is
more than that for placebo [102], but similar to that associated
with risperidone [54,59,84].
a cochrane review of the incidence of eps (including akathisia), related events or use of medication to avoid eps concluded that there was no statistically significant difference
between  xxxd3195xxx  (8, 12 or 20 mg) and placebo [36] and significantly fewer incidences compared with haloperidol. after
6 weeks of treatment with either  xxxd3195xxx  or haloperidol,
and regardless of dose, the same number of patients remained
in the study. after 1 year, more haloperidol participants had
left the study, either because of noncompliance or any other
reason, suggesting better compliance for  xxxd3195xxx  compared
with haloperidole participants.
 xxxd3195xxx  is contraindicated in combination with drugs
that are known to prolong the qt interval, such as thioridazine, quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants.  xxxd3195xxx  is also contraindicated in
patients who have significant cardiac disease, plasma hypopotassaemia, significant hepatic impairment and also in pregnant
and lactating women.

conclusions

schizophrenia is associated with increased mortality for two
reasons: cardiovascular disease and suicide. cardiovascular
deaths probably reflect the lifestyle of schizophrenic patients,
as well as the high frequency of type 2 diabetes among such
patients.  xxxd3195xxx  prolongs the qt interval, but recent large
epidemiological studies do demonstrate that the all-cause
mortality after treatment with  xxxd3195xxx  is not different than
with other antipsychotics. however, because of the qtc problem,  xxxd3195xxx  treatment will require ecg monitoring at
baseline, when steady state is reached (3 – 4 weeks after full

dose) and then every third month during long-term treatment. mandatory ecg monitoring does not have to be
viewed as negative, but should be considered as good medical
practice. in spite of the high frequency of cardiovascular
problems among schizophrenics, few seek help and few
receive help from the treatment system. routine ecg monitoring is a cheap, noninvasive method to identify patients
with an undiscovered cardiovascular disorder without inducing anxiety in the patient.  xxxd3195xxx  only induces a moderate
weight increase (compared with olanzapine and clozapine)
and its lack of sedative effects may improve health by promoting the physical activity of patients. thus, one negative feature (qt prolongation) may be balanced by the positive
effects (small weight gain, routine cardiac checks, more physical
activity) and mean that there is no empirical difference in cardiac
mortality compared with other antipsychotic compounds.
with respect to suicide in schizophrenia, a meta-analysis
by harris and barraclough suggested an odds ratio of
8.5-times, with a variation between studies of 0.8 – 115 [85]:
the rate during treatment with  xxxd3195xxx  was 0.37 per 100
patient-years of exposure, which is favourable compared with
the rates for olanzapine of 0.89 and for risperidone of
1.17 [83]. as stated in a previous section, lack of compliance is
probably the most important factor for suicide in
psychosis [57]. compliance reflects patients’ acceptance of

drug treatment, which in turn reflects, among many factors,
clinical efficacy and a low frequency of side effects.
10.

expert opinion

 xxxd3195xxx  is a compound that shows a fairly restricted profile of
effects on certain receptor populations and brain structures. it
mainly affects dopamine d2, serotonin 5-ht2 and  xxxg87xxx   xxxg830xxx -adrenergic receptors. the effect on d2 receptors is more pronounced in
the limbic dopamine system compared with the nigrostriatal system. this is supported by findings from clinical trials that provide evidence for significantly fewer eps than haloperidol [81].
weight gain is moderate, there is no diabetogenic effect reported
and there are no reports suggesting any risk of immunologically
mediated side effects. the all-cause mortality after treatment
with  xxxd3195xxx  is at the same level as for other antipsychotics.
clinical efficacy is on the same level as other second-generation
compounds, but with potential superiority for effects on cognition because of the freedom of sedative effects and no need for
anticholinergic control of side effects. in terms of economy, it
compares well with risperidone and costs less than, for example,
olanzapine. it should not, at present, be selected as the first
compound to treat a patient, but its clinical profile makes its
use as a second-in-line drug worthwhile in many patients who
do not respond as well to other compounds.
