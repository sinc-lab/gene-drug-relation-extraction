abstract
ouabain is a plant-derived  xxxd2799xxx  that inhibits the catalytic activity of na ,k -atpase (sodium pump; nka).
dihydroouabain, a derivative of ouabain with a reduced lactone ring, is commonly used as a sodium pump antagonist. it has
been assumed that commercially available dihydroouabain is homogeneous. we now report that preparations of
dihydroouabain contain two components each with a different potency for inhibition of sodium pump activity. we used
reverse-phase hplc chromatography, uv spectrophotometry, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (esi-ms), nuclear
magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy and two independent bioassays to characterize these compounds. the two
dihydroouabain fractions (dho-a and dho-b) resolved by 3 min chromatographically, had uv absorbance maxima at
196 nm, and comprised 37% and 63% of the stock dihydroouabain, respectively. the molar potency of each component for
inhibition of nka from porcine cerebral cortex differed by 4.4-fold (dho-a, ic50 = 7.13 þ 0.8 wm; dho-b, ic50 = 1.63 þ 0.12
wm). the relative potencies were 9% and 40% of those of ouabain, respectively. a similar pattern for phosphorylation of
nka was observed. mass spectrometry (esi-ms) and fragmentation patterns are consistent with dho-a and dho-b being
isomers of identical molecular mass (587 da) and each with six hydroxyl groups, a deoxyhexose sugar moiety and a lactone
ring. furthermore, nmr spectroscopy revealed structural differences between dho-a and dho-b by displaying noticeably
different chemical shifts at only two groups of proton resonances assigned to h-21 and h-22. the esi-ms and nmr results
confirm the presence of the isomerism at c20 of the lactone ring. our results demonstrate the existence of two molecular
forms of dihydroouabain, each with a different biological potency. these findings underscore the importance of
characterizing the purity of dihydroouabain commercial preparations. it also provides possible molecular models for
investigating the metabolism of endogenous ouabain-like factors recently reported in mammals. ß 1999 elsevier science

1. introduction
cardiac glycosides are plant-derived potent inotropic agents known to mediate their e¡ects through
inhibition of the catalytic activity of na ,k -atpase (nka, sodium pump). ouabain is the most
widely used  xxxd2799xxx  in experimental procedures and is obtained from extracts of the east african ouabain tree or seeds of the plant strophanthus
gratus [1]. preparations of dihydroouabain, a derivative of ouabain in which the lactone ring does not
contain a conjugated double bond (i.e., the ring is
saturated, see fig. 1), are used in studies characterizing the role of nka activity in ion transport and in
investigating nka isoform function. although dihydroouabain and ouabain have very similar molecular
characteristics, many physiological and pharmacological studies favor using dihydroouabain to investigate the positive inotropic e¡ect of cardiac glycosides on the sodium pump. two principal reasons for
this preference are that the e¡ects of dihydroouabain
are readily reversible (e.g., sodium £ux recovers four
times faster after removal of dihydroouabain when
compared to ouabain) [2], and that it provides a

rapid onset of positive inotropic action and a rapid
washout. for example, use of dihydroouabain has
permitted experimental veri¢cation that the observed
e¡ect on sodium pump-mediated currents is speci¢cally due to the action of the  xxxd2799xxx  itself
[3]. for these reasons, commercial preparations of
this compound have been routinely used to study
the mechanism of inhibition of the sodium pump,
the contribution of sodium pump activity to the resting membrane potential [4], and characterization of
several biochemical properties of the sodium pump
isolated from a variety of mammalian tissues [5^8].
dihydroouabain has also been used to investigate the
mechanism of action of other drugs on myocardial
tissue in di¡erent mammals [9^13] and to investigate
the roles of di¡erent ion channels (e.g., ca2 , na ,
k ) in cells from various tissues [14^17].
the importance of characterizing the chemically
reduced cardiac glycosides (i.e., the dihydro-species
such as dihydrodigoxin or dihydroouabain) has recently been underscored by evidence demonstrating
that dihydrodigoxin (the lactone-hydrogenated form
of digoxin) interacts with speci¢c isoforms of
na ,k -atpase to a much greater extent than was

fig. 1. structure of dihydroouabain (dho). note that dho is a derivative of ouabain in which the lactone ring does not contain a
conjugated double bond. dihydroouabain contains one sugar molecule of rhamnose attached at the c-3 position of the steroid nucleus. the aglycone consists of a steroid nucleus with the reduced lactone ring attached at the c-17 position. the molecular weight of
dihydroouabain is 586 da.

previously assumed [18,19]. two other important
reasons for characterizing isomeric components of
dihydroouabain are the recent ¢ndings demonstrating the existence of endogenous dihydro-dlif
(dihydrodigoxin-like immunoreactive factor) in
mammalian tissues [20], a chemically reduced counterpart to dlif, and the existence of endogenous
ouabain-like factors (olf) [21,22]. these data all
suggest that plant-derived dihydroouabain may likely
be used as a working model for studying the properties of endogenous ouabain-like counterparts.
dihydroouabain has traditionally been considered
a less potent sodium pump inhibitor than ouabain
[23]. however, reports show a wide range of dihydroouabain concentrations required to inhibit the
catalytic activity when compared to using ouabain
(e.g., ic50 concentrations range from about 3- to
80-fold less potent than ouabain) under similar experimental conditions [3,24,25]. such wide variations
in inhibitory potency might be explained by unique
stoichiometric interactions due to polymorphism of
both sodium pump isoforms [18,19] as well as the
glycosides themselves (e.g., deglycosylated or dihydro-species). another explanation for the variation
in observed bioactive potency may be heterogeneity
of the components in preparations of dihydroouabain stock used in the experiments.
it has been assumed that commercially available
preparations of dihydroouabain contain only one
compound. in the present study, we show that solutions of dihydroouabain are comprised of two distinct molecular species each with a di¡erent biological potency for inhibition of na ,k -atpase and
for ouabain-induced phosphorylation of sodium
pump k subunits. the ¢nding of two forms of dihydroouabain now provides intriguing possibilities
for models exploring the metabolism of endogenous
olfs and their interactions with the sodium
pump.
2. materials and methods
2.1. chemicals and reagents
all chemicals used were reagent grade. ouabain,
dihydroouabain, porcine cerebral cortex, all reagents
for catalytic inhibition of the sodium pump (atp,

ammonium molybdate, tween-80, bovine serum
albumin) and all reagents for gel electrophoresis
(acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, n,n,np,np-tetraethylethylene diamine (temed), tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane ( xxxd3449xxx  base), sodium dodecyl
sulfate (sds), glycine, l- xxxd26xxx , bromophenol dye) were purchased from sigma (st. louis,
mo). ammonium persulfate was obtained from amresco (solon, oh). prestained protein markers were
obtained from bio-rad (richmond, ca). phosphorus-32-phosphate (32 pi, 1 mci in 100 wl) was purchased from nen, life science products (boston,
ma). acetonitrile (ch3 cn), chromatographic grade,
was obtained from aldrich co. (milwaukee, wi).
serial dilutions of dihydroouabain (dho) in the
range of 1036 to 1033 were used in both catalytic
activity inhibition of the sodium pump and ouabain-stimulated phosphorylation studies. we used
six di¡erent lots of dihydroouabain (sigma): d0670 (i) 125h4060, d-9267 (e) 16h0460, d-0670
(i) 76h4109, d-0670 (i) 45h4029, d-0670 (i)
25h4002, and d-9267 (e) 64h0231.
2.2. equipment and materials
we used hplc with a c-18 reverse-phase wbondapak column (3.9u300 mm, 10 wm particle size)
connected to a waters 600e system controller and
a waters 996 photodiode array detector. hplc fractions were collected with a waters fraction collector
from millipore corp. (milford, ma) and evaporated
with a jouan centrifugal vacuum concentrator rc
10.22 connected to a jouan refrigerated trap rct
60 (winchester, va). a hewlett-packard (palo alto,
ca) model 8452a diode array spectrophotometer
was used for uv spectrophotometry.
for sodium pump inhibition assays, disposable
non-sterile 96-well £at-bottom polystyrene microtiter
plates were purchased from corning (corning, ny)
and the absorbance was measured on a dupont microplate reader ii, multiskan mcc/340 (wilmington, de). monoclonal mouse anti-rabbit nka isoform-speci¢c antibodies from upstate biotechnology
inc. (ubi, lake placid, ny) and goat anti-mouse
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody from
bio-rad (hercules, ca) were used to detect the sodium pump isoforms by western analysis. gel electrophoresis [26] to resolve the proteins of interest was

bbagen 24902 2-11-99

h.m.a.m. qazzaz et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1472 (1999) 486^497

performed on both minigel and vertical slab gel electrophoresis units from hoefer scienti¢c instruments
(model se 245, se 260 and se400, san francisco,
ca). acid gels were dried on a slab gel dryer (sdg
4050) connected to a savant gel pump ( xxxg1784xxx )
(farmingdale, ny). densitometry measurements of
the 32 pi-radiolabelled bands (autoradiograms) were
performed on a laser densitometer, si (molecular
dynamics, sunnyvale, ca). for the immunoassay
cross-reactivity studies an ouabain eia reagent kit
was purchased from nen research products (boston, ma).
2.3. hplc reverse-phase chromatography
chromatographic separation of the two dihydroouabain components (dho-a and dho-b) was
accomplished by using an isocratic-mode mobile
phase of 10% ch3 cn in distilled water (dh2 o).
typically, hplc fractions (1 ml/min) analyzed by
uv absorbance at 196 nm were collected over a period of 40 min, evaporated and reconstituted in
dh2 o.
2.4. molar absorptivity and determination of
concentration
uv spectral properties, molar absorptivity, and
concentrations of dho-a and dho-b were calculated
according to qazzaz et al. [27]. brie£y, the uv absorbance of serial dilutions of known concentrations
of dihydroouabain stock preparation in the range of
0.001 to 1.6 mm were analyzed by linear best ¢t
statistical analysis and plotted. at their respective
maximum absorbance wavelengths, we assumed
comparable molar absorptivity between dihydroouabain and its two components (dho-a and dho-b).
2.5. na +,k +-atpase catalytic activity inhibition
assay
this assay was used to measure the e¡ect of the
two components (dho-a and -b) on phosphate release in hydrolysis of atp based on the method of
chan and swaminathan [28] with minor modi¢cations to increase the sensitivity of the method for a
small volume of sample. 20 wl of sample containing
the desired concentration of each component of di-

489

hydroouabain was preincubated at 37³c in a water
bath for 10 min. as a source of k subunit (all isoforms) of na ,k -atpase, 20 wl of the porcine cerebral cortical na ,k -atpase solution diluted in
tris bu¡er ph 7.8 (1 u/ml) was added for a further
20 min incubation. 20 wl of atp (10 mm in tris
bu¡er ph 7.8) was added and allowed to react for
an additional 15 min. the ¢nal concentrations of the
mix were as follows: potassium 3.3 mmol/l, sodium
133.3 mmol/l, magnesium 3.3 mmol/l, and atp
3.3 mmol/l, in tris-hcl bu¡er ph 7.8. after the incubation period, we added 150 wl of molybdate solution (per liter, 1.0 mmol of molybdate, 11 mmol of
 xxxd3258xxx , and 142 ml of tween 80:methanol solution (12:88 by vol)). color development was allowed to proceed for 30 min, after which the color
intensity was measured at 340 nm. the color intensity is proportional to the release of phosphate ions
which is a direct indicator of atp breakdown and
therefore nka activity. for statistical purposes, all
samples were assayed three to ¢ve times each with
duplicates that were corrected for background (assay
bu¡er only), averaged, and normalized to ouabainsensitive na ,k -atpase activity (100% inhibition
at 1 mm ouabain). each value represents the
mean þ s.d. of the number of the sample assays performed. the percentage of na ,k -atpase activity
inhibition represents the proportion of ouabain activity that is inhibitable by either dho-a or dho-b.
the statistical analysis, including a best ¢t by logit
regression curves to determine the concentration of
inhibitor required for 50% inhibition (ic50 ), was performed using spss for windows, version 7.5 (spss,
chicago, il).
2.6. ouabain-stimulated

32

pi phosphorylation

ouabain-stimulated phosphorylation was performed according to huang et al. [29] with minor
modi¢cations. dried frozen pieces of porcine cerebral
cortical tissue (pcc) as a source for k subunit (all
isoforms) of the sodium pump were reconstituted at
1 u/ml in bu¡er containing 50 mm tris-hcl and
2 mm mgcl2 , at a ph of 7.2. the reconstituted
tissue was then washed three times and resuspended
in the same bu¡er. total protein concentration was
determined by bio-rad protein assay (bio-rad,
hercules, ca) and adjusted to 1 mg/ml.

h.m.a.m. qazzaz et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1472 (1999) 486^497

the gel electrophoretic mobility of the three k isoforms of the sodium pump from pcc was con¢rmed
by western blot analysis with isoform-speci¢c antibodies to the three k isoforms. each isoform on the
blot was visualized using a horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and the signal
was detected on an autoradiogram by chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instruction
(amersham life sciences, buckinghamshire, uk).
phosphorylation of the k isoforms corresponded to
a single band on autoradiographs [30].
to evaluate the phosphorylation level, the radioactively labelled acid-stable phosphoenzyme/intermediate was resolved by acid gel electrophoresis.
60 wl aliquots of pcc were preincubated at room
temperature for 25 min with 20 wl of 50 wm of either
dho-a or dho-b in the reaction bu¡er (50 mm trishcl, 2 mm mgcl2 , ph 7.2). a positive control was
preincubated with 20 wl of a 50 wm ouabain solution
and a negative control was preincubated with 20 wl
of bu¡er alone. 10 wl of 32 pi (1 mci in 100 wl) was
diluted with 250 wl of phosphoric acid and puri¢ed
through a 0.2 wm ¢lter to remove polyphosphates. at
the end of the incubation, 20 wl of the 32 pi ¢ltrate
(30 wm, 8 wci) was added and incubated at 21³c for
an additional 15 min. the reaction was terminated
by the addition of 1 ml 8% hclo4 and the sample
was resuspended in bu¡er containing at a ¢nal concentration: 0.5% by volume hclo4 , 2.5% by weight
sds, 10% by volume glycerol and 0.1% by weight
pynominy dye. samples (100 wl) were loaded on a
7.5% sds polyacrylamide gel and run for 4^5 h at
30 ma in the cold room at 4³c. the gel was ¢xed in
40% methanol, 10% acetic acid, dried, autoradiographed and radioactivity was quantitated using
soft laser scanning densitometry. incorporation of
32
pi into k isoforms by dho-a and dho-b was normalized to the incorporation of 32 pi into k isoforms
by equimolar concentrations of ouabain.
2.7. mass spectrometry
electrospray ionization spectrometry scan (esims) work was performed at the department of
pharmacology and toxicology, school of medicine,
university of louisville, louisville, ky 40292 using
a micromass quattro lc7 instrument in electrospray-positive ionization mode.

2.8. nmr spectroscopy
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data
were obtained on a bruker amx500 nmr spectrometer operating at 500.13 mhz. samples were
prepared by dissolving approximately 100 wg of
each hplc-puri¢ed dho component in 125 wl of
deuterated methanol (cd3 od) and transferred to a
3 mm nmr sample tube (wilmad 327-pp). preliminary 1 h and 13 c data were obtained in a nalorac
3 mm z-spec mdb probe. two-dimensional nmr
experiments (1 h-1 h cosy, 1 h-13 c hmqc, hmbc)
were performed with the 3 mm sample tube in a 5 mm
bb inverse probe using the standard bruker pulse
sequences.
3. results
3.1. separation of two dihydroouabain components
in a previous study we reported a hplc method
which co-eluted dihydroouabain, ouabain and ouabagenin as a single fraction [31]. in this study we set
out to further separate those components using an

fig. 2. reverse-phase (c-18) hplc elution pattern (time and
sequence) of ouabain congeners. standards of ouabain (23 wm),
ouabagenin (36.5 wm) and dihydroouabain (9.0 wm) are separated by an isocratic 10% ch3 cn mobile phase over 40 min.
the dihydroouabain stock is separated into two distinct chromatographic peaks (named a and b) that are resolved by 3 min.
dho-a has a retention time of 24.5 min and dho-b 27.5 min.
assuming similar molar absorptivities, dho-a represents 37%
(3.3 wm) and dho-b 63% (5.7 wm) of the total dho stock
amount injected. the ratio of dho-a to dho-b was consistent
for six lots of dihydroouabain stock analyzed.

isocratic mobile phase of 10% ch3 cn for 40 min. in
the process of developing the procedure we found
that the dihydroouabain stock solution yielded two
distinct components separating by at least 3 min. we
labeled these two components dho-a (at 24.5 min)
and dho-b (27.5 min), respectively (fig. 2).
3.2. spectral properties and concentration of two
dihydroouabain components
the uv spectra of the chromatographic fractions
show that dho-a and dho-b have the spectral absorbance characteristic of a cardenolide with a saturated lactone ring, i.e., maximum absorbance at 196
nm and with lower molar absorptivity than the nonreduced ouabain (fig. 3). assuming similar molar
absorptivity for the two fractions, we calculate the
relative amounts of each fraction in the stock solutions to be 37% (dho-a) and 63% (dho-b) of the
total stock amount of dihydroouabain loaded on the
column. this ratio was within experimental error
consistent for all six lots of dihydroouabain preparations obtained from sigma.

fig. 3. absorbance spectra of ouabain and its congeners. dihydroouabain has a maximum absorbance at 196 nm with lower
absorptivity than ouabain (note scales are di¡erent). ouabain
and its deglycosylated congener absorb maximally at 220 nm.
the absorbance spectra of the two components (dho-a, dhob) of dihydroouabain are similar to their dihydroouabain stock.
concentrations are: 85 wm dho-a and 95 wm dho-b (estimated by molar absorptivity at 196 nm), 15 wm ouabain, 25
wm ouabagenin (both by weight).

fig. 4. inhibition of na ,k -atpase catalytic activity. (a) the
concentration dependence inhibition curves for ouabain, ouabagenin, and the two dihydroouabain components, dho-a and
dho-b, isolated from a dihydroouabain stock preparation.
note that the inhibitory potency of dho-a (ic50 = 7.4 wm) is
4.5 times less than dho-b (ic50 = 1.7 wm). each point represents the average of three to ¢ve experiments. the y-axis represents the extent of inhibition of the ouabain-inhibitable atpase
activity (1.0 = 100% inhibition as determined at a ouabain concentration of 1 mmol/l). (b) comparison of ic50 of ouabain
and congeners (ouabagenin, dho-a, and dho-b). note that the
order of decreasing potency in wm is: dho-a (7.13 þ 0.80,
n = 4), ouabagenin (2.57 þ 0.095, n = 3), dho-b (1.63 þ 0.12,
n = 3), ouabain (0.66 þ 0.09, n = 5). each value in this ¢gure represents the mean (average) þ s.d. of the number of sample assays (n) performed.

3.3. inhibition of na +,k +-atpase catalytic activity
by dihydroouabain components
the relative potencies for inhibition of na ,k atpase catalytic activity (porcine cerebral cortex)
by ouabain, ouabagenin, and the two dihydrooua-

bain components, dho-a and dho-b, are shown in
fig. 4a. in calculating concentrations of dho-a and
dho-b we assume they each have similar molar absorptivities at 196 nm. fig. 4b shows the ic50 in
descending order for each of these compounds:
dho-a (7.13 þ 0.8 wm, n = 4); ouabagenin (2.57 þ
0.095 wm, n = 3); dho-b (1.63 þ 0.12 wm, n = 3);
and ouabain (0.66 þ 0.095 wm, n = 5). note that the
inhibition response of dho-b is not parallel to those
of the other compounds.
3.4. phosphorylation of na +,k +-atpase by
dihydroouabain components

fig. 5. ouabain-induced phosphorylation of na ,k -atpase.
(a) phosphorylation of the k isoforms (k-1, k-2 and k-3) of
na ,k -atpase from porcine cerebral cortical tissue induced
by the dihydroouabain components a and b and by ouabain.
phosphorylation induced by an equal concentration of ouabain
was included in these studies for comparison. the reaction mixture of enzyme (pcc), 30 wm (8 wci) of 32 pi and 2 mm mg2
was incubated either in the presence of equimolar concentrations (50 wm) of ouabain, dho-b, dho-a, or with bu¡er only
(negative control, nc). the labeled phosphoenzyme intermediates were resolved by electrophoresis on 7.5% sds-page acid
gels. the molecular weight protein markers (207, 112 and
79 kda) illustrate the position of the k subunit. (b) diagram illustrating the relative potency of incorporation of 32 pi into k
isoforms of the na ,k -atpase induced by dho-a and dho-b
relative to ouabain. the density of the band on the autoradiogram was measured by laser scanning densitometry. incorporation of 32 pi into the k subunits by dho-a and -b was normalized to that of an equivalent concentration of ouabain.

ouabain-stimulated 32 pi phosphorylation of the
na ,k -atpase k subunit has been demonstrated
by askari et al. [30]. this process incorporates pi
covalently into the same aspartyl amino acid of the
k subunit of na ,k -atpase that is phosphorylated
by atp during atp-hydrolysis [32]. fig. 5 shows the
phosphorylation of the k subunits of na ,k -atpase mediated by ouabain and the two components
isolated from the dihydroouabain stock. the incorporation of 32 pi into the k subunit when stimulated
by ouabain, dho-a, and dho-b is concentration dependent (i.e., more 32 pi is incorporated as the concentration of the inhibitors increases, data not
shown). for the same concentration of all compounds (50 wm) the extent of phosphorylation (density of the gel band) paralleled the relative potency of
inhibition of catalytic activity discussed above (i.e.,
component dho-b has approximately twice the activity of dho-a (fig. 5b)). when phosphorylation is
measured in terms of potency of phosphorylation
(percent incorporation of 32 pi normalized to that
produced by an equimolar concentration of ouabain), component dho-b produced 85.7% þ 4.3
(n = 3) of the ouabain-induced 32 pi incorporation
while dho-a produced 41.3% þ 2.8 (n = 3).
3.5. mass spectrometry
fig. 6a,b shows the fragmentation pattern and
relative ion abundance obtained by positive ion
esi mass spectrometry of the two components isolated from the dihydroouabain stock, in addition to
the stock itself for comparison. the principal ion of
the active material in all three compounds has a m/z

fig. 6. mass spectral analysis of dho-a, dho-b and dihydroouabain stock preparation. (a) daughter mass spectral analysis of dhoa and dho-b. dihydroouabain stock was included for comparison. a single unique peak seen at m/z 587.1 was identi¢ed as the protonated ion [m+h ] in all three spectra. similarly, identical signals were observed at m/z 147 and 85 in all three spectra and are identi¢ed as the rhamnose sugar moiety and the lactone ring of dihydroouabain, respectively. overall, the two puri¢ed compounds dho-a
and dho-b gave identical fragmentation patterns to each other and to the dihydroouabain stock from which the two components
were isolated. (b) a representative mass spectrum over the mass range 420^600 of dihydroouabain stock. identical signals were observed for dho-a and dho-b. successive losses of six water molecules from the intact species were seen at m/z 569.1, 551.2, 532.9,
515.1, 497.2, and 479.0. the ions seen at m/z 502.9 and 441.0 were identi¢ed as the molecule without the lactone ring [m3lactone

(mass/charge ratio) of 587. this ratio corresponds to
the protonated ion of a substance of integer mass
586.7 da identical to that expected for dihydroouabain. both compounds have an elemental composition of (c29 h46 o12 ) based on the accurate mass. the
theoretical accurate mass of both compounds is
587.76 da (protonated form) as determined by esi
mass spectrometry (data not shown). linked-scan
ms/ms was used to analyze the daughter ion fragments of this ion from dho-a, dho-b, and dihydroouabain stock (from which the two components
were isolated); this resulted in several fragments of
interest. ions were assigned as follows: (m+h ) is
the parent molecule with m/z 587.1, b is
[(m3lactone)+h ] with m/z 503, and c, [(m3rhamnose sugar)+h ] with m/z 441, is the aglycone peak
that results from the cleavage of the glycoside bond
and loss of the sugar moiety indicating that the sugar
in both dho-a and dho-b is also a deoxyhexose
similar to dho stock (fig. 6a,b). in all three spectra,
ions corresponding to successive losses of alicyclic
dehydrations were seen: m/z 569.1 [m3(h2 o)] ,
551.2 [m3(2uh2 o)] , 532.9 [m3(3uh2 o)] ,
515.1 [m3(4uh2 o)] , 497.2 [m3(5uh2 o)] , and
479.0 [m3(6uh2 o)] (fig. 6b). in addition, three
major fragments were observed corresponding to the
three components of dihydroouabain: the steroid nucleus, the rhamnose sugar, and the lactone ring with
m/z of 356.9, 146.8, and 84.9 respectively (fig. 6a).
the mass spectral observations and identical fragmentation patterns suggest strongly that dho-a
and dho-b are molecular isomers.
3.6. nmr spectroscopy
fig. 7a,b shows the result of the 500 mhz 1 h
nmr data of dho-a and dho-b, respectively. as
illustrated, the hplc-puri¢ed samples display nearly
identical proton nmr spectra, both in chemical shift
and in signal intensity. only two groups of proton
resonances were observed to display noticeably different chemical shifts between the two dho samples,
indicated by arrows in fig. 7. these two groups of
resonances were assigned to h-21 and h-22, based
on their chemical shifts and coupling patterns observed in the 1 h-1 h cosy experiment (data not
shown). the chemical shift of the methylene protons
adjacent to the oxygen of a simple substituted 5-

fig. 7. 500 mhz 1 h nmr spectra of dho isomers a and b
obtained after hplc puri¢cation. as illustrated, samples a
and b display identical 1 h nmr spectra, with the noted exception of those protons associated with the ab methylene systems
attributable to h-21 and h-22. assignments were based on
chemical shift analysis and 2d cosy and hmq(b)c experiments. the truncated signals (x) at n 3.65 and 3.3 ppm originate from tris and cd3 od, respectively.

member lactone is generally observed to range between 4.0 and 4.5 ppm [33]. thus, the ab pair of
multiplets that are observed within this chemical shift
range can be assigned with certainty to h-21. the
assignments of h-21 and h-22 are further con¢rmed
from the 2d-cosy experiment via their mutual coupling to h-20 methine proton (n 2.86 ppm), as well
as via 2d proton-carbon correlation nmr experiments.
4. discussion
in this report we demonstrate the presence of two
isomers of dihydroouabain (dho) existing in stock
solutions provided by the only supplier known to

bbagen 24902 2-11-99

h.m.a.m. qazzaz et al. / biochimica et biophysica acta 1472 (1999) 486^497

us. these isomers (dho-a and dho-b) have distinctly di¡erent potencies for inhibiting the ion transport activity of na ,k -atpase. reverse-phase
hplc with an isocratic elution pro¢le of 10%
ch3 cn over 40 min separates the two components
by at least 3 min. dho-a elutes at 24.5 min and dhob at 27.5 min (fig. 2). due to the slight structural
and polarity changes brought about by the saturation of the c20^22 bond, both dho-a and b have
uv maximum absorbance at 196 nm (fig. 3) which
is characteristic of saturated lactone rings on cardenolides [34]. the biological activity of the two components of dihydroouabain, assessed by their abilities
to inhibit the catalytic activity and to phosphorylate
the k subunit of na ,k -atpase from porcine cerebral cortex, demonstrates that dho-b has greater
potency than dho-a (figs. 4 and 5). despite the
fact that hplc was able to resolve these two components, mass spectral analysis was unable to detect
any structural di¡erences between the two dho components (fig. 6a,b). however, mass spectrometry
data are consistent with dho-a and dho-b having
identical molecular masses (587 da). both components have six hydroxyl groups that were evident
by the loss of one water molecule per hydroxyl group
from the parent ion. they both have a deoxyhexose
sugar moiety (m/z 441 da), and a lactone ring (m/z
503 da). it is evident from fig. 6a that the mass
spectra of the two dho components are identical in
their fragmentation patterns. also, no additional
mass fragments were observed in the mass spectra
of the dihydroouabain stock that were absent in either dho-a or dho-b.
when nmr spectroscopy was employed to further
investigate the structural di¡erences of the two dho
components (dho-a and dho-b), the data obtained
were further support for the existence of isomerism
in these two components. the two components revealed nearly identical proton nmr spectra, both in
chemical shift and in signal intensity except at two
groups of proton resonances in which they displayed
remarkably di¡erent chemical shifts (assigned to h21 and h-22). to our knowledge, published nmr
data for dihydroouabain, or even similar sterols containing the reduced 5-member lactone ring, do not
exist. however, the chemical shift of the methylene
protons adjacent to the oxygen of a simple substituted 5-member lactone is generally observed to

495

range between 4.0 and 4.5 ppm in agreement with
the chemical shift observed for h-21 [34]. the assignments of h-21 and h-22 are further con¢rmed from
the 2d-cosy experiment via their mutual coupling
to h-20 which indicates that the isomerization is at
position h-20. typically, enantiomers do not separate using reverse-phase hplc. the fact that our
two dihydroouabain components separate by reverse-phase hplc suggests that these molecules are
diastereomeric at position h-20.
a search of the literature and personal communications have failed to reveal evidence that dihydroouabain occurs naturally in plants. in general,
dihydro-species of the cardenolides are produced in
vitro through hydrogenation of the cyclobutenolide
ring of the plant-derived oxidized species using a
catalyst (hydrogenation with platinum oxide at
room temperature or with palladium-carbon at
50³c). the process of hydrogenation proceeds to
completion and can be monitored by loss of an absorption maximum at 218 nm in ethanol [35]. the
structure of the plant-derived ouabain has naturally
several asymmetrical chiral centers but none at the
lactone ring. due to the hydrogenation process of
these cardenolides, an extra asymmetrical chiral center is produced at c20 leading to the formation of
two isomeric compounds [36,37].
although no work to our knowledge has been reported on the isomers associated with dihydro-derivatives of ouabain, extensive work has been done on
the digitalis compounds, digoxin and  xxxd1884xxx . in
the case of digoxin, hydrogenation of the lactone
ring linkage results in production of two isomeric
compounds which have been assigned to the 20k
and 20l steroid series [38] (see fig. 1). the presence
of two isomers of dihydro-digitalis species was also
con¢rmed by several studies [39,40] using hydrogenated digitoxigenin and digoxigenin to produce the
20:22 dihydrogenins (dihydrodigitoxigenin and dihydrodigoxigenin). of interest is that the reduced metabolites of digoxin represented by two epimers of
dihydrodigoxin (termed 20r-dhd3 and 20sdhd3) were found to be formed by gastrointestinal
bacteria in patients on digoxin therapy [41] and the
predominant epimer found in humans after this process is 20r-dhd3 [42].
thus, our data indicate that commercially available dihydroouabain is a mixture of two isomers

bbagen 24902 2-11-99

which is consistent with the lack of stereoselectivity
in the chemical reduction of the 20^22 double bond.
the isomeric site at c20 accounts for both the biological and chromatographic di¡erences observed in
our ¢ndings.
previous studies suggest that under similar experimental conditions the relative potencies of ouabain
and its related congeners for inhibition of sodium
pump catalytic activity are ouabain s ouabagenin s dihydroouabain [43]. our present data indicate
that one of the dihydroouabain isomers (dho-b) is
equally, if not more potent than ouabagenin. therefore, puri¢ed dho-b may be a more suitable working
model for characterizing the relationship between the
rhamnose sugar and the oxidation-reduction state of
the lactone ring in binding to the active site of the k
subunits of the sodium pump. for example, recent
work using dihydrodigoxin [18] shows that the dihydro-species of cardiac glycosides in general has di¡erential inhibitory potency for individual na ,k atpase k subunit. in fact, the non-parallel response
of dho-b compared with the other components
tested in our na ,k -atpase inhibition experiments
(fig. 4) suggests that the interaction of this one isomer relative to its potency of inhibition may be different (i.e., subunit dependent) for the individual k
subunit isoforms found in pcc (pcc contains three
k isoforms of nka). this is intriguing because of its
implication in targeted selected regulation of pump
isoforms by these compounds or their endogenous
recently discovered counterparts [44^47]. therefore,
the discovery of two isomers of dihydroouabain has
import in characterizing the interaction of these isomeric molecules with na ,k -atpase and its isoforms.
the presence of two isomers of dihydroouabain at
unpredictable relative concentrations and having unde¢ned but di¡erent potencies may also be an explanation for reported di¡erences in ic50 of dihydroouabain [3,24,25] in studies characterizing
kinetics of the inhibition of the sodium pump
[48,49] and studying membrane current potential
[50]. these results would be in£uenced by the heterogeneity of the commercial plant-derived preparations of dihydroouabain. furthermore, the production of anti-dihydroouabain antibodies must take
into account the fact that there are two isomers of

dihydroouabain, suggesting the need for further puri¢cation.
our results also indicate the potential use of these
isomeric dihydroouabain compounds as model molecules in characterizing endogenous cardenolide-like
factors found in mammals. several lines of investigation have revealed the presence of endogenous  xxxd2799xxx -like factors in mammalian tissues.
these factors have properties similar to those of ouabain (olf, hif) [21,22] and to digoxin (dlif) [51].
deglycosylated congeners of dlif and of olf analogous to those of digoxin and ouabain, respectively,
have also been described [27]. of relevance to our
present ¢ndings is the recent discovery of a dihydro-dlif (analogous to dihydrodigoxin) in mammals and the suggestion that it may be a precursor
of dlif [20]. thus, plant-related dho-a and dho-b
may be useful models for characterizing congeners of
endogenous ouabain-like factors and their precursors
or metabolic products.
in summary, dihydroouabain preparations are not
homogeneous. they are comprised of two isomeric
components chromatographically separable and having distinctly di¡erent biological potency. to our
knowledge this is the ¢rst report of the existence of
two isomers of dihydroouabain and demonstrating
their distinctly di¡erent biological potencies.
