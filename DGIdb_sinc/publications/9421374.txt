 xxxg2134xxx  in pancreatic islets
crucial target molecule in diabetes induced with
multiple low doses of  xxxd3249xxx  in mice
zhiyong wang and helga gleichmann

in mice, diabetes can be induced by multiple low doses
of  xxxd3249xxx  (mld-stz), i.e., 40 mg/kg body wt on
each of 5 consecutive days. in this model, diabetes develops only when stz induces both p-cell toxicity and tcell-dependent immune reactions. the target molecule(s) of mld-stz-induced p-cell toxicity are not
known, however. in this study, we report that  xxxg2134xxx  is
a target molecule for mld-stz toxicity. ex vivo, a gradual decrement of both  xxxg2134xxx  protein and mrna expression was found in pancreatic islets isolated from mldstz-treated c57bl/6 male mice, whereas mrna expression of p-actin, glucokinase, and  xxxg1193xxx  remained
unaffected. significant reduction of both  xxxg2134xxx  protein
and mrna expression was first noted 1 day after the
third stz injection, clearly preceding the onset of hyperglycemia. the extent of reduction increased with the
number of stz injections administered and increased
over time, after the last, i.e., fifth, stz injection. the
stz-induced reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  protein and mrna was
not due to an essential loss of p-cells, because ex vivo,
not only the total rna yield and protein content in isolated islets, but also  xxxg1193xxx  mrna expression, failed
to differ significantly in the differently treated groups.
furthermore, islets isolated from mld-stz-treated
donors responded to the nonglucose secretagogue arginine in a pattern similar to that of solvent-treated
donors. interestingly, the mld-stz-induced reduction of
both  xxxg2134xxx  protein and mrna was prevented by preinjecting mice with 5-thio-d-glucose before each stz injection. apparently,  xxxg2134xxx  is a crucial target molecule of
mld-stz toxicity, and this toxicity seems to precede
the immune reactions against p-cells. diabetes 47:50-56,

ease process. despite abundant data obtained in two animal
models of spontaneous autoimmune diabetes, the nod
(nonobese diabetic) mouse and the bb (biobreeding) wistar
rat, the initial islet-specific factor(s) and the molecular mechanism^) triggering the autoimmune process have yet to be
identified.
a model of experimentally induced autoimmune diabetes
is that induced by multiple low doses of  xxxd3249xxx 
(mld-stz), a naturally occurring p-cell toxin for mice, rats,
and humans that consists of a d-glucopyranose and a  xxxd2685xxx  (mnu) group (3-6). intraperitoneal injections
of stz, 40 mg/kg body wt, administered on 5 consecutive days,
are known to affect p-cells and to elicit local, t-cell-dependent immune reactions. diabetes will gradually develop in
genetically susceptible male recipients only when both
effects are induced (7-11). therefore, in certain mouse
strains, suppression of either the toxicity (11) or the immune
reaction (12) prevented diabetes development.
this study was undertaken to analyze whether mld-stz
would affect p-cell molecules involved in the response to
glucose. this investigation was thought necessary because it
was found that both a p-cell cytotoxic concentration of stz
and an equimolar concentration of its mnu moiety that was
nontoxic for p-cells alkylated the 7 position of guanine to the
same extent and were similarly effective in inducing dna
strand breaks and in activating  xxxg1667xxx 
(13). hence, stz-induced p-cell toxicity appears to involve
more complex, and perhaps more selective, mechanisms
than the supposed capacity of stz to carbamoylate and alkylate dna (4) and to generate reactive oxygen species that
might damage dna (14,15). here, we asked whether the
glut isotype  xxxg2134xxx  in p-cells is a target molecule for mldstz. the rationale is based on the facts that expression of the
facilitative  xxxg2134xxx  in p-cells is required to catalyze the
uptake of glucose as the first event in glucose-stimulated
insulin incretion (16) and the loss of  xxxg2134xxx  expression is
associated with failure to respond to glucose (17). furthermore, having reported on the prevention of mld-stz diabetes
by intraperitoneal injection of 5-thio-d-glucose (5-t-g) before
each stz injection (11), we asked whether in addition to
being a transporter for stz (17),  xxxg2134xxx  could be a target molecule for stz toxicity. because pretreatment with 5-t-g did
not reduce mld-stz-induced insulitis (11), lesions of
 xxxg2134xxx  were considered as early events preceding hyperglycemia and inflammatory reactions. similarly, it has been
reported that reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  in autoimmune bb rats may
contribute to the loss of glucose-stimulated insulin release that
precedes profound p-cell depletion (18). it is conceivable

that comparable to the mld-stz diabetes model, the
impaired response to a glucose load during the clinically
silent prediabetic period in patients with type 1 diabetes may
result from a loss or dysfunction of molecules involved in glucose transport that precedes autoimmune destruction of the
p-cells. this idea is supported by the findings that patients
with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes have autoantibodies to
 xxxg2134xxx , which inhibit glucose transport into rat 3-cells
(19,20). in our study, we report that mld-stz gradually
reduced  xxxg2134xxx  expression during the 5 days of treatment preceding the mld-stz-induced immune reactions and diabetes manifestation. furthermore, pretreatment of mice with
5-t-g prevented mld-stz-induced reduction of  xxxg2134xxx .
research design and methods
mice. male c57bl/6 mice, 5-6 weeks old, were purchased from bomholtgard
(bomholtgard, denmark). they were kept under specific pathogen-free conditions, received tap water and rodent diet (ssniff m, ssniff, soest, germany) ad libitum, and were 7-8 weeks old at the beginning of the experiments.
reagents. stz (boehringer mannheim, mannheim, germany) was dissolved in
cold  xxxd1710xxx  buffer (ph 4.0) at a concentration of 0.4% and injected intraperitoneally within 5 min after preparation. 5-t-g and arginine (sigma, deisenhofen,
germany) were dissolved in 0.9% saline at the concentrations indicated. krebsringer bicarbonate buffer (krbb) (ph 7.4) was prepared with reagents obtained
from merck (darmstadt, germany). acrylamide, collagenase, hepes, and lymphocyte separation medium were purchased from serva (heidelberg, germany).
treatment of mice. to analyze the effects of mld-stz on  xxxg2134xxx  expression in
(3-cells, mice were injected intraperitoneally as described (3) and were killed at
different time intervals during and after treatment. they were injected with stz,
40 mg/kg body wt, either once or on 3 or 5 consecutive days, as indicated. to analyze the effects of 5-t-g on mld-stz-induced reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  expression, one
group of mice was injected intraperitoneally with 5-t-g, 50 mg/kg body wt, just
before each mld-stz injection. mice injected with only the solvents of stz and
5-t-g served as controls for those injected with stz and 5-t-g, respectively.
before the onset of treatment, all animals were weighed and their blood glucose
concentrations determined. pancreatic islets were isolated 24 h after thefirst,third,
and fifth injections and 3 and 7 days after the fifth stz injection. islets of the control donors were isolated 24 h after the fifth injection. the day of the first injection was designated day 0. immediately after isolation, 100 islets of each individual
mouse were stored at -80°c until  xxxg2134xxx  determination.
insulin release from isolated islets. to investigate whether mld-stz results
in essential loss of f}-cells before development of hyperglycemia, a (3-cell function
test was performed ex vivo. groups of five mice each were injected with either
mld-stz alone or mld-stz in addition to 5-t-g. mice injected with only the solvent of stz served as controls. islets were isolated from individual mice 7 days
after the last injection. duplicates of 10 islets from each mouse were used to determine basal, glucose-stimulated, and arginine-stimulated release of immune reactive insulin (irt), using a protocol slightly modified from one previously described
(21,22). islets were incubated in falcon 24-well culture plates (becton dickinson,
essen, germany) containing 250 ul krbb for 60 min at 37°c to obtain the basal
insulin release. then, they were transferred to another well, which contained 230
ul krbb. a final concentration of 16.7 mmol/1 was obtained by adding 20 ul of
either glucose or arginine solution. after another 60 min of incubation, the
medium was collected for measurement of stimulated insulin release. all samples
were kept at -20°c until determination of iri.
western blot analysis. islets were isolated from individual mice treated with
either mld-stz alone or mld-stz in addition to 5-t-g. for each analysis, 100 islets
were lysed in sds-containing buffer and then sonicated using braun-sonic 2000
v (b. braun melsungen ag, melsungen, germany), according to the method of
thorens et al. (23). protein content of lysates was determined by the bio-rad protein assay kit (bio-rad, munich, germany). western blot analysis of  xxxg2134xxx  protein expression was performed according to the protocol described by westermeier (24) with slight modifications. briefly, 30 ug of total protein from differently
treated groups of mice was separated with 10% sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25). resolved proteins were transferred onto an immobilon teflon
membrane (millipore, eschborn, germany) for 1.5 h, using the trans-blot sd semidry transfer cell system (bio-rad). the filters were incubated with a polyclonal
antibody raised against amino acids 512-523 of mouse  xxxg2134xxx  (provided by dr.
b. thorens, university of lausanne, switzerland) at a 1:200 dilution, followed by
incubation with 125i-labeled protein a (amersham, braunschweig, germany) for
4 h. all experiments were carried out at room temperature. the filters were then
subjected to autoradiography using intensifying screens and hyperfilm mp
diabetes, vol. 47, january 1998

(amersham) for 24 h at -70°c. quantitative analysis of the signals was obtained
by using omni media scanning densitometry (millipore, ann arbor, mi).
determination of plasma glucose. blood samples were collected from the retroorbital venous plexus of nonfasted animals between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m., using 20ul capillary glass tubes. glucose concentration was determined by the hexokinase
method using an apc 5040 autoanalyzer (eppendorf, hamburg, germany).
hyperglycemia was defined as a blood glucose level >11.1 mmol/1.
bri measurement. samples were analyzed in duplicate for iri levels by radioimmunoassay kits (pharmacia biotech, freiburg, germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
rna preparation. total rna was extracted from pools of all islets isolated from
groups of 7-10 mice each, using the trizol reagent kit (life technologies,
gaithersburg, md) according to the manufacturer's instructions. the rna preparation was stored at -80°c until use.
rna reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. reverse transcription into cdna of 1 ug of total rna from islets was performed using moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (rt) (life technologies), followed by amplification of target genes by polymerase chain reaction
(pcr) as described by watson and demmer (26). to amplify tlie mouse  xxxg2134xxx ,
 xxxg1193xxx , and glucokinase cdna, primer pairs were commercially synthesized
by mwg-biotech gmbh (ebersberg, germany) as follows: for  xxxg2134xxx , 5'atgtcagaagacaagatcaccgga-3', 3'-cctactggacggattttggctc-5';
for glucokinase, 5'-ggccaccaagaaggaaaaggt-3', 3'-acgaccagtttcacc
ctctcc-5'; for  xxxg1193xxx , 5'-ggcttcttctacacaccca-3', 3'-atggtcgac
ctcttgatgac-5'. for relative quantitation of pcr products, a primer pair for
mouse (3-actin gene (clontech, palo alto, ca), a housekeeping gene, was included
as an internal control. the 5' primer is identical to nucleotides 25-45 (21-mer) in
the mrna sequence (27). the 3' primer is the reverse complement of nucleotides
564-587 (24-mer). pcr was carried out as previously described (26). the rt reaction was amplified using taq polymerase (boehringer mannheim). the cycle
numbers were chosen to be on the linear, i.e., exponential, phase of the amplification
for the four different genes: 26 for  xxxg2134xxx  and p-actin, 25 for  xxxg1193xxx , and 34 for
glucokinase. pcr products (10 ul) were run on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide (0.1 ug/ml), and the resulting bands were photographed with
polaroid instant pack film 665 (polaroid, cambridge, ma). to exclude the possibility of genomic dna contamination during rna preparation, negative controls
were set up for each pcr amplification, using purified rna as template.
data analysis. band intensity of thefilmswas determined using omni media scanning densitometry (millipore, ann arbor, mi). the ratio of the intensity integral of
target pcr products to that of 3-actin was calculated. data represented are means
± se of three independent experiments. for statistical analysis, the unpaired student's t test was used. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

results

reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  protein expression by mld-stz
and its prevention with 5-t-g. the numbers of pancreatic
islets isolated from mice that had received one, three, or five
injection(s) of stz, or the solvent of stz, did not differ significantly from each other; they varied between a minimum
mean of 136 ± 17 and a maximum mean of 152 ± 16 per
mouse, as calculated from groups of 4-5 mice each. therefore, the data obtained in differently treated donors can be
compared.
western blot analyses of islet lysates of individual mice
revealed that treatment with mld-stz resulted in progressively decreasing  xxxg2134xxx  protein expression (fig. 1). after one
injection of stz, no change in  xxxg2134xxx  expression was
observed compared with the value for control mice. after
three injections of stz, however, a marked reduction of
 xxxg2134xxx  expression occurred and was even more pronounced
on days 1 and 7 after thefifthstz injection. densitometric values expressed as percentage of the control value (100%)
revealed reductions of 64 ± 6.4, 50 ± 3.2, and 15.7 ± 4.7% on
day 1 after the third andfifthinjections and on day 7 after the
fifth injection, respectively. a noteworthy observation was that
the signal representing  xxxg2134xxx  protein expression 7 days
after the last stz injection was the most reduced in all mice
tested and was only 7% of the control value (fig. 1a, lane 5).
at this time, the mouse was hyperglycemic with a blood glu51

in contrast, preinjection of mice with 5-t-g right before
each stz injection distinctly mitigated the mldstz-induced reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  protein expression. preinjection of 5-t-g before each of the first three stz injections

cells from stz toxicity. even the pronounced reduction of
 xxxg2134xxx  expression seen after five stz injections was clearly
mitigated by the total offivepreinjections with 5-t-g. seven
days after the last stz iryection, -50% of  xxxg2134xxx  expression
was still detectable in the 5-t-g-pretreated islet donor. for the
following two reasons, it is unlikely that the reduction in
 xxxg2134xxx  protein expression was secondary to either mldstz-induced hyperglycemia or essential 3-cell loss. first,
the blood glucose levels, although slightly increased 7 days
after the last stz injection, failed to differ significantly in the
differently treated groups of mice. second, the total protein
contents of 100 islets isolated from each mouse did not differ significantly (table 1).
reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  mrna by mld-stz treatment
and its prevention with 5-t-g. the primers designed to
amplify a sequence encoding the  xxxg2134xxx  protein would result
in 752-base pair (bp) products. a primer pair for (3-actin
mrna, which generated 540 bp products, was included in the
amplification reactions as an internal control. as shown in fig.
2a, there was a progressive reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  mrna with
each stz injection, and the reduction continued over time,
after the last of thefivestz injections; in contrast, the f$-actin
mrna level remained unchanged. however, pretreatment
of mice with 5-t-g protected  xxxg2134xxx  mrna expression from
mld-stz toxicity (fig. zb). negative controls did not produce
a signal and thus excluded genomic dna contamination during rna preparation. the relative quantitation of  xxxg2134xxx 
mrna expression was made by calculating the ratio of the
intensity integral of  xxxg2134xxx  mrna to that of 3-actin. a significant reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  mrna levels was found in mice
treated solely with mld-stz compared with the ratios of solvent-treated donors (fig. 2c). however, pretreatment with 5t-g before each stz injection significantly prevented stzinduced reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  mrna. the difference between
the values obtained in the groups of mice treated with both 5t-g and stz did not differ significantly from the value
obtained in the control group that had been injected with
only 5-t-g. the reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  mrna levels was not due
to a major loss of p-cells, because the total rna content was

mld-stz treatment failed to reduce glucokinase and

applied to  xxxg2134xxx  amplifications, we designed a specific
primer pair to amplify the sequence encoding glucokinase protein, which would yield 254 bp. because glucokinase mrna
was expressed at a much lower level than that of p-actin,
coamplification of both molecules in one tube would result
in complete inhibition of glucokinase cdna amplification.

therefore, amplification reactions of these two molecules
were carried out separately in different tubes. as shown in fig.
3a, mld-stz exerted no effects on glucokinase mrna
expression. the ratios of the mrna intensity integral of
glucokinase to that of (3-actin remained comparable to the values of the control group throughout the experimental period
(fig. 3e). furthermore, the expression of  xxxg1193xxx  mrna
also remained unaltered throughout the experimental period,
and the ratios of the mrna intensity integral of  xxxg1193xxx  to
that of p-actin remained akin to the control value (fig. 4).
ex vivo basal and stimulated iri release of islets. isolated islets were stimulated with either glucose or arginine,
applying 16.7 mmol/1 as the final concentration. mldstz-treated mice demonstrated significant loss of glucosestimulated iri release compared with solvent-treated controls. however, pretreatment of mice with 5-t-g significantly prevented islets from mld-stz-induced impairment
of 3-cell function. the difference between the values of solvent-treated and 5-t-g-plus-mld-stz-treated groups was
not significant. in contrast, islets from the three differently
treated groups of mice showed similar iri responses to the
arginine stimulus. thus, the unaffected iri response to the
nonglucose secretagogue arginine indicates that treatment
with mld-stz did not induce essential (b-cell loss (fig. 5).

and on the time interval allowed between the last stz treatment and islet isolation. the decreasing effect of stz on
 xxxg2134xxx  mrna expression was at least preferential, if not
selective, because mrna expression of  xxxg1193xxx  and glucokinase, both of them p-cell-specific molecules, and of (3actin, a housekeeping gene, remained unaffected. it is
unlikely that the observed preferential stz-induced reduction
of  xxxg2134xxx  protein and mrna was caused by a major loss of
3-cells, because the total protein content and, in contrast to
glucose-stimulated iri release, the response to the nonglucose
secretagogue arginine were preserved in islets of mldstz-treated donor mice. presumably, differential (3-cell toxicity to stz determines whether a major (3-cell loss occurs in
different strains of mice, since it is known that (3-cells from
c57bl/6 mice are more resistant to stz treatment than are
those from cd-i and c57bl/ksj (29), as defined by morphological examination. the present data of severe reduction
in  xxxg2134xxx  expression and failure to respond to glucose stimulation of islets from mld-stz-treated, nondiabetic donors
may relate to the (3-cell glucose insensitivity observed in the
prediabetic phase of autoimmune diabetes in both humans
(1,2) and bb rats (18).
conceivably,  xxxg2134xxx  facilitates intracellular uptake of stz
through its glucose moiety, and stz toxicity is inflicted by the
mnu moiety (17). pretreatment of mice with 5-t-g prevented
(3-cells from both stz-induced decrement of  xxxg2134xxx  protein
and  xxxg2134xxx  mrna expression and from functional impairment. presumably, 5-t-g, a sulfur analog of glucose, blocked

fig. 5. ex vivo iri release of islets isolated from solvent-treated, mldstz-treated and 5-t-g plus mld-stz-treated mice. basal (d) iri
release was comparable in the three differently treated groups. mldstz treatment significantly reduced (*p < 0.0001) glucose-stimulated
(e3) iri release, whereas pretreatment with 5-t-g significantly protected (**p < 0.0002) islet function against mld-stz-induced functional impairment. in contrast, iri responses to arginine ( • ) remained
essentially unaffected by mld-stz treatment. for these functional
tests, a final concentration of 16.7 mmol/1 was used for both glucose and
arginine. data are means ± se of five mice per group.

the  xxxg2134xxx  and thus prevented cellular uptake of the toxicant
of stz via the glucose moiety. an enhancement of  xxxg2134xxx  protein expression by 5-t-g appears less likely to be a protective
mechanism, because only metabolizable glucose analogs—not
nonmetabolizable glucose analogs, such as 5-t-g—were
found to enhance  xxxg2134xxx  expression (30). whatever the
mechanism of protection by 5-t-g may be, it seems to operate on the level of  xxxg2134xxx .
previously, we and our colleagues reported that pretreatment with 5-t-g prevented mld-stz-induced diabetes in
c57bl/6 and balb/c male mice without affecting the degree
of insulitis induced by mld-stz (11). we speculated that 5t-g might have competed with the glucose moiety of stz for
a recognition site on (3-cells. in the present study, we report
that the mld-stz-induced  xxxg2134xxx  toxicity was already
detectable on day 4 after the onset of stz treatment, thus preceding the peri- and intra-islet cellular immune reactions
known to develop 8-11 days after the onset of stz treatment
(3,4,11). hence, our findings strongly suggest that the (3-cell
 xxxg2134xxx  is a target for initiating the diabetogenic process in
mld-stz diabetes in c57bl/6 mice. in agreement with this
assumption are the investigations showing that transfection
with  xxxg2134xxx  cdna of the insulinoma rin and the neuroendocrine anterior pituitary att-20ins cell lines caused their susceptibility to stz toxicity, whereas transfection with the
isoform glut1 failed to do so (17). moreover, mnu alone,
the aglycone moiety of stz, failed to exert toxicity on the
 xxxg2134xxx -transfected cell lines. thus, there is impressive
agreement between the results obtained with  xxxg2134xxx -transfected cell lines and our results obtained in the mld-stz
model of diabetes in vivo regarding the importance of
 xxxg2134xxx  for stz toxicity. obviously, the differential toxic
effects of stz and mnu on islets, as first reported by
ledoux et al. (13), is regulated by  xxxg2134xxx ; this molecule
seems to permit uptake of stz and, as the present study
demonstrates, is at the same time an early and apparently crudiabetes, vol. 47, january 1998

cial target of mld-stz toxicity. we propose that mldstz-induced  xxxg2134xxx  reduction probably resulted from toxic
effects on both the  xxxg2134xxx  protein and the gene level. it is
speculated that as an underlying mechanism, reactive oxygen species that are generated by stz (31) mediate damage
to the  xxxg2134xxx  molecule, and that the most toxic ones, the
hydroxyl radicals that are formed from  xxxd2298xxx 
through local interaction with adventitious iron, are the
major effectors. at present, however, it cannot be resolved
whether stz first damages the  xxxg2134xxx  protein and subsequently affects  xxxg2134xxx  gene expression or whether toxic
effects start at the gene level and then result in reduction at
the protein level. although the results obtained in the
c57bl/6 mld-stz diabetes model of the present study point
to  xxxg2134xxx  as the crucial target for the initiation of disease,
we cannot exclude toxic effects of stz on glucokinase activity or on other molecules involved in glucose signaling, such
as the physical coupling of  xxxg2134xxx  with other cellular proteins, as recently reported by hughes et al. (32).
regarding glut expression, however, human (3-cells prepared from pancreatic tissue of nondiabetic cadaver organ
donors differ from rodent p-cells in that in humans, expression of the isoform glut1 predominates over that of
 xxxg2134xxx  (33). this difference may account for the relative
resistance of human (3-cells to stz toxicity reported by
eizirik et al. (34). this relative resistance, though, does not
necessarily exclude the existence of mechanisms in the
etiopathogenesis of human diabetes that parallel those discussed in the present study for mld-stz-induced diabetes.
in our view, a search for glucose-carrying environmental
agents that cause diabetes and resemble stz in its bipartite
structure is warranted.
in conclusion, a marked reduction of  xxxg2134xxx  was found at
the protein and mrna levels, and this effect seemed to precede the mld-stz-induced insulitis. the noxious effect on
 xxxg2134xxx  was preferential, if not selective, because mrna
expression of  xxxg1193xxx , glucokinase, and f$-actin remained
unaffected. pretreatment with 5-t-g prevented mld-stz toxicity on  xxxg2134xxx  expression and subsequent diabetes development. it is conceivable that similar toxic effects on the pcell structures involved in glucose-sensing by human (3-cells
converge with subsequent immune reactions to (3-cell
destruction in human type 1 diabetes.
