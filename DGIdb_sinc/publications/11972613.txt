summary

background allergic airway eosinophilia is suppressed by cysteinyl leukotriene (cyslt) receptor
( xxxg599xxx ) antagonists in several species including humans and guinea-pigs, suggesting that
cyslts are directly or indirectly involved in induction of the response.
objective we examined the effect of cyslt antagonists ( xxxd2995xxx  and mci-826) on antigen
inhalation-induced eosinophilia in peripheral blood and lung, and on  xxxg1180xxx  activity in serum during
late increase of airway resistance (late asthmatic response, lar) in sensitized guinea-pigs.
methods guinea-pigs inhaled ovalbumin (ova) Â‡ al(oh)3 and ova mists alternately for sensitization and challenge, respectively, once every 2 weeks. at the fifth challenge, the effects of cyslt
antagonists and an anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody (trfk-5) on the occurrence of lar, and blood and lung
eosinophilia, which appeared at 5 h after challenge, were examined. the time-course of  xxxg1180xxx  activity
in the serum after the challenge was evaluated by measuring in vitro `eosinophil survival prolongation
activity'. the influence of cyslt antagonists on  xxxg1180xxx  activity was assessed.
results cyslt antagonists and trfk-5 completely abolished blood and lung eosinophilia. lar
was suppressed by both mci-826 and trfk-5 by 40Â±50%. sera obtained from sensitized, challenged animals 3 h and 4 h after challenge induced an obvious prolongation of eosinophil survival.
the activity of the sera was completely neutralized by prior exposure to trfk-5, suggesting that it
reflected  xxxg1180xxx  activity. increased  xxxg1180xxx  activity in the serum was inhibited by both  xxxd2995xxx  and
mci-826 by over 90%.
conclusions cyslts produced after antigen provocation sequentially induced  xxxg1180xxx  production
from some immune component cells via  xxxg599xxx  activation. thus, it is likely that cyslts
indirectly cause antigen-induced eosinophilia through  xxxg1180xxx  production.

introduction
the late asthmatic response (lar) is one of the characteristic
features of allergic bronchial asthma in addition to the early
asthmatic response (ear) and bronchial hyper-responsiveness.
suggested causes of lar are related to lung eosinophilia [1,2].
the migration of eosinophils into the airway is thought to be
due to the release of chemotactic factors such as  xxxg1180xxx  [3],  xxxg354xxx 
[4] and lipid mediators [5,6] from activated immunocomponent
cells. of lipid mediators formed in the allergic reaction, the
cysteinyl leukotrienes (cyslts), ltc4, ltd4 and lte4, may
play a signiÂ®cant role in eosinophil inÂ®ltration into the airways
of several species including humans [7] and guinea-pigs [8,9].
underwood et al. [9] have indicated that a single exposure to
ltd4 at high doses causes  xxxg599xxx -mediated airway
eosinophilia in guinea-pigs and that an anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody

(trfk-5) completely inhibited it, suggesting that the eosinophilia induced by ltd4 inhalation depends on  xxxg1180xxx  production.
in addition, antigen-induced eosinophilia in the lung tissue of
sensitized guinea-pigs is suppressed by both  xxxg599xxx 
antagonists [8,10] and trfk-5 [11,12]. however, whether
cyslts produced following an antigenÂ±antibody reaction sequentially induce  xxxg1180xxx  production leading to lung eosinophilia
during lar is not clear.
in contrast to the involvement of cyslts in tissue eosinophilia [7Â±10], cyslt-induced blood eosinophilia has not been
identiÂ®ed.  xxxg1180xxx  may be an important factor for the mobilization
of eosinophils, probably from the bone marrow to the peripheral blood and for priming eosinophils to easily respond to
other chemotactic factors such as chemokines that may migrate
eosinophils to local tissues [13].
on the other hand, a chronic experimental asthmatic model
showing not only lar and lung eosinophilia but also blood
eosinophilia, which are suggested to be elicited upon repeated
exposures to antigen [14], is indispensable for analysing these
phenomena. we established a repeated antigen inhalationinduced asthmatic model using guinea-pigs, in which lar

appears after a latent period of repetitive sensitization and
challenge with antigen [15]. in addition, we reported that eosinophilia in the peripheral blood and the airway preceded or
coincided with the lar, which occurred 5Â±7 h after challenge
[15,16]. blood eosinophilia transiently appeared 3Â±5 h after
antigen challenge [16], and at 5 h eosinophils had accumulated
in the lung tissue [17] but not in the airway cavity [16]. however,
a few hours later, eosinophils started to migrate into the airway
cavity, followed by sustained accumulation up to day 3 [16].
thus, antigen provocation Â®rst triggers eosinophil recruitment
into the blood from putative tissues of the cellular pool or from
bone marrow as found in guinea-pigs [13]. eosinophils then
migrate to the lung and Â®nally inÂ®ltrate the airway cavity.
that eosinophilia precedes or coincided with lar suggests
that eosinophils inÂ®ltrating the lung are involved in the induction of lar. however, detailed mechanisms leading to blood
eosinophilia and subsequent lung eosinophilia are not clear.
the present study Â®rst evaluated the possible role of cyslts
in the eosinophilia at lar in our model using the  xxxg599xxx 
receptor antagonists,  xxxd2995xxx  [18,19] and mci-826 [20].
secondly, the involvement of  xxxg1180xxx  in not only eosinophilia but
also lar was assessed in the sensitized guinea pig using trfk5. finally, assuming that blood eosinophilia is induced by  xxxg1180xxx 
that was sequentially produced by cyslts following antigen
provocation, time-course changes in circulatory  xxxg1180xxx  activity
after challenge were observed, and the effect of cyslt antagonists on the increase of  xxxg1180xxx  activity was evaluated.

materials and methods
animals
allergic asthmatic models were generated and eosinophils were
collected from 5-week-old (300Â±400 g) and 15Â±20-week-old
(700Â±900 g) male hartley guinea-pigs (japan slc,
hamamatsu, japan), respectively. the animals were housed in
an air-conditioned room for at least 2 weeks after purchase at a
temperature of 23 + 1  c and 60 + 10% humidity, illuminated
from 08.00 to 20.00 h, fed with a standard laboratory diet and
given water ad libitum. experimental protocols and the animal
care methods were approved by the experimental animal
research committee at kyoto pharmaceutical university.

kyoto, japan); diff-quikÃ² solution (international reagents,

 xxxd2995xxx  and mci-826 were suspended and dissolved in
0.5%  xxxd2609xxx .
ova Â‡ al(oh)3 for sensitization was prepared as reported
[15,21]. ova solution for challenge was prepared at a concentration of 16 mg/ml.

sensitization and challenge with antigen
sensitization and challenge by inhalation of mists of ova Â‡ al
(oh)3 and ova, respectively, were performed as described [15].
in brief, conscious guinea-pigs were sensitized by forced inhalation of ova Â‡ al(oh)3 mists at a dose of 15 mg ova/750 mg
al(oh)3/animal/time, once every 2 weeks for the Â®rst 4 weeks.
the animals were then forced to inhale ova (10 mg ova/
animal/time) and the ova Â‡ al(oh)3 mists alternately for
challenge and sensitization, respectively, once every 2 weeks
until the Â® xxxg818xxx  challenge (week 20) (sensitizedÂ±challenged
group). two negative control groups were: (i) guinea-pigs that
had been sensitized and challenged as described above, were
forced to inhale physiological saline instead of ova at the time
corresponding to the Â® xxxg818xxx  challenge (sensitizedÂ±non-challenged
group); (ii) guinea-pigs that had been treated with physiological
saline mist instead of antigens once every 2 weeks were
treated with physiological saline on the same experimental
day as the sensitizedÂ±non-challenged group (non-sensitizedÂ±
non-challenged group).
in preliminary experiments over 60% of the sensitized guineapigs died immediately (within 20 min) following the Â®rst challenge, and the second challenge induced severe anaphylactic
symptoms including laboured breathing and cyanosis in most
of the animals. therefore, all animals were administered  xxxd3050xxx  prior to the Â®rst to third challenges. however, as very few
animals exhibited such severe reactions at the fourth challenge,
the fourth and the Â® xxxg818xxx  provocations were performed without
 xxxd3050xxx .
as reported elsewhere [15], at the fourth to tenth challenges,
increase of airway resistance (raw) was biphasically observed in
an almost reproducible fashion: transient increase of raw was
induced 10 min after challenge followed by restoration of the
elevation to the level before challenge at 2Â±3 h. at 5Â±7 h after
challenge, raw of challenged guinea-pigs increased again in a
relatively persistent manner.

administration of drugs or anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody
 xxxd2995xxx  (30 mg/kg), mci-826 (3 mg/kg) or vehicle (0.5%
 xxxd2609xxx ) was administered orally 1 h before the Â® xxxg818xxx 
challenge at a volume of 2 ml/kg. trfk-5 (50 mg/kg) or
r3Â±34 (50 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 10 min before
the challenge at a volume of 2 ml/kg.

blood drawing for counting leucocytes
five hours after the Â® xxxg818xxx  ova inhalation challenge, peripheral
blood was drawn in the presence of a 100 u/ml Â®nal concentration of heparin from the abdominal vein of each of
the sensitizedÂ±challenged guinea-pigs under pentobarbital
anaesthesia (40 mg/kg, i.p.). blood samples from the sensitizedÂ±

cysteinyl leukotriene-dependent  xxxg1180xxx  production

non-challenged and the non-sensitizedÂ±non-challenged groups
were also drawn 5 h after saline inhalation in the same manner.
the total leucocyte number was determined by staining with
turk's solution. to determine the differentiated leucocyte
number, the blood specimen was centrifuged on a cell settling
chamber (neuro probe, cabin john, md, usa) at 50 g for 30 s
at 4  c after hypotonic treatment, then settled leucocytes were
stained with diff-quikÃ² solution, followed by the microscopic
counting of at least 500 cells.

isolation of the lung to measure  xxxg720xxx  (epo)
activity in the homogenate
following drawing blood, animals of the respective groups were
exsanguinated from the abdominal aorta. the lungs were perfused with physiological saline via the pulmonary artery, then
isolated. the right lower lobe was weighed and used to determine epo activity. procedures for measurements were as
follows. the lobe was homogenized (4  c, 12 000 r.p.m.,
20 s  2) in 10 volumes (v/w) of assay buffer consisting of 0.3 m
sucrose in 50 mm acetate buffer (ph 5.4) and then again (4  c,
8000 r.p.m., 20 s  2) in the presence of 0.2% triton x-100Ã². epo
activity in the homogenate was measured as described by tagari
et al. [22], who modiÂ®ed the method of bozeman et al. [23]. a
50-ml aliquot of the 50-fold diluted homogenate was added to
200 ml of the assay buffer with or without 5.3 mm kbr in a
polypropylene tube. after adding 100 ml of 3.9 mm 3,30 ,5,50 tetramethylbenzidine containing 2.8 mm h2o2 and mixing well,
the mixture was incubated for 5 min at 21  c. the peroxidase
reaction was terminated by adding 200 ml of 1 n h2so4. after
centrifugation (20  c, 1700 g, 5 min), 200 ml of the supernatant
was transferred into a microtitre plate (maxisorp; nunc,
roskilde, denmark), and the optical density at 450 nm was
measured. epo activity is expressed as od + kbr. this
method using bromide ions is speciÂ®c for epo [23].

measurement of pulmonary function
as described [15], airway resistance (raw) was measured using a
two-chambered, double-Â¯ow plethysmograph system (pulmosi; m.i.p.s., osaka, japan) according to the method of pennock
et al. [24] before, and  xxxd1891xxx  min and 5 h after challenge without
anaesthesia.

measurement of `eosinophil survival prolongation activity'
( xxxg1180xxx  activity) in serum
 xxxg1180xxx  activity in serum was indicated by prolonged eosinophil
survival (hereafter referred as `eosinophil survival prolongation
activity'). to measure such prolongation activity, blood was
drawn 1, 3 and 4 h after the Â® xxxg818xxx  challenge from the abdominal
vein of the sensitizedÂ±challenged guinea-pigs under pentobarbital anaesthesia. blood samples from the sensitizedÂ±
non-challenged and non-sensitizedÂ±non-challenged groups
were also withdrawn.
in vitro eosinophil survival prolongation activity in the sera
was measured using eosinophils that had been collected from
bronchoalveolar lavage Â¯uid (balf) of sephadex g-200treated guinea-pigs. as described [25], 18 h after an intravenous
administration of sephadex g-200 (10 mg/kg), bal was performed with ca2Â‡-free tyrode's solution containing 0.1% bsa.
the recovered cells were treated hypotonically and incubated in
polystyrene Â¯asks at 37  c for 1 h, then suspended non-adherent
cells were stratiÂ®ed on discontinuous (50, 60 and 70%) percoll

layers. after centrifugation at 360 g for 30 min at 4  c, eosinophils were recovered from the bottom of centrifuge tubes. purity
of eosinophils was over 97% as determined by staining with
diff-quikÃ². the viability of the recovered cells was over 99%
as determined by trypan blue dye exclusion test.
puriÂ®ed eosinophils suspended in rpmi-1640 medium containing 10% fbs, 50 mm  xxxd26xxx , 200 u/ml penicillin and 200 mg/
ml streptomycin (105 cells/100 ml/well) were incubated with
100 ml of serum or 2  10 14 2  10 10 g/ml rmil-5 in a
polystyrene 96-well microplate (iwaki, chiba, japan) at 37  c
for 7 days in 5% co2 and 95% air. to neutralize the activity,
serum and rmil-5 were treated with trfk-5 or the isotype
matched control, r3Â±34, at 4  c for 30 min before being added
to the eosinophil suspension. after a 7-day incubation, cell
viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion.

statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed by the one-way analysis of
variance. if signiÂ®cant difference was detected, the individual
group difference was determined by bonferroni's multiple test.
a probability value (p) below 0.05 was considered statistically
signiÂ®cant.

results
effect of cyslt antagonists on antigen-induced blood and
lung eosinophilia, ear and lar
the effects of the speciÂ®c antagonists against cyslts,  xxxd2995xxx  and mci-826, on blood and lung eosinophilia are shown in
table 1. the elevation of epo activity in the lung homogenate
was regarded as an indicator of tissue eosinophilia. both  xxxd2995xxx  and mci-826 abolished blood and lung eosinophilia. in
addition, mci-826 signiÂ®cantly suppressed both ear (fig. 1a)
and lar (fig. 1b) to approximately 50% and 40%, respectively. inhibitions of these obstructive responses by mci-826
was to the same degree as that induced by  xxxd2995xxx  [17]. on
the other hand, neither mci-826 nor  xxxd2995xxx  affected the
numbers of other leucocytes (monocytes, neutrophils and
lymphocytes) in the blood of the sensitizedÂ±challenged group
(data not shown).

effect of anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody on antigen-induced blood and
lung eosinophilia, ear and lar
the effects of an anti- xxxg1180xxx , trfk-5, on the blood and lung
eosinophilia, are shown in table 2. trfk-5 decreased the
number of blood eosinophils to a level lower than that of
sensitizedÂ±non-challenged animals. induction of eosinophilia
in the lung tissue was also abolished by trfk-5. on the other
hand, the numbers of other leucocytes (monocytes, neutrophils
and lymphocytes) in the blood in the sensitizedÂ±challenged
group were not signiÂ®cantly inÂ¯uenced by the anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody (data not shown).
although ear was not affected by trfk-5 (fig. 2a), the
antibody attenuated lar by approximately 50% (fig. 2b).

agreement with those in other reports [8,10Â±12]. in addition,
these agents completely suppressed the blood eosinophilia in
our asthmatic model. these results suggest that eosinophilia in
the lung and the circulation almost entirely depend on cyslts
and  xxxg1180xxx . to assess whether cyslts are involved in the production of  xxxg1180xxx , we evaluated the effect of cyslt antagonists on
the increase in serum  xxxg1180xxx  activity. both speciÂ®c  xxxg599xxx  antagonists,  xxxd2995xxx  and mci-826, almost completely
abolished elevated serum  xxxg1180xxx  activity. these Â®ndings indicate
that cyslts produced after the antigenÂ±antibody reaction sequentially induced  xxxg1180xxx  production from immunecomponent
cells via  xxxg599xxx  activation.
guinea-pig lung mast cells can release large amounts of
cyslts, probably within 30 min of antigen provocation [26].
in the present study, the serum  xxxg1180xxx  activity was increased at 3 h
after the challenge and blood eosinophilia peaked at 5 h after
the challenge [16]. in addition, the intravenous administration
of human recombinant  xxxg1180xxx  produced blood eosinophilia that
peaked 1 h later in guinea-pigs [13,27]. these Â®ndings suggest
that cyslts produced at the ear are responsible for  xxxg1180xxx

production. however, the cellular source of  xxxg1180xxx  is unclear.
lynch et al. [28] found that normal human peripheral blood
leucocytes have surface  xxxg599xxx  receptors. more recently, it was
reported that a very small percentage of human cd4Â‡ and
cd8Â‡ t cells from normal donors expresses  xxxg599xxx 
on their surface [29]. in addition, it is well known that human
cd4Â‡ t cells are capable of producing  xxxg1180xxx  [30]. therefore,
cellular source of  xxxg1180xxx  in response to cyslts might be t cells,
although  xxxg599xxx  receptors on guinea-pig t cell surface have
not been identiÂ®ed yet. figueroa et al. [29] speculated that
 xxxg599xxx  expression may be up-regulated in lymphocytes from asthmatic subjects. the repeated sensitization/challenge with antigen in our model might also up-regulate the
receptor expression on guinea-pig lymphocytes.
on the other hand,ltd4 may behave as a potent chemoattractant in vitro for human eosinophils at physiologically
relevant concentrations as low as 10 10 m [31]. we used an
in vitro chemotaxis assay to examine whether or not ltd4
directly causes guinea-pig eosinophil migration. only high
concentrations (10 7 and 10 6 m) of ltd4 induced

concentration- dependent mobilization of the eosinophils (data
not shown), indicating a species difference between humans and
guinea-pigs in eosinophil responsiveness to ltd4. cysltdriven eosinophilia in guinea-pigs is mainly due to indirect
mechanisms involving other chemotactic factors such as  xxxg1180xxx .
the intravenous injection of  xxxg1180xxx  signiÂ®cantly increased the
number of eosinophils in the peripheral blood of guinea-pigs
[13,27]. however, an intradermal injection of  xxxg1180xxx  did not
produce tissue eosinophilia [13].  xxxg1180xxx  (i.v.) potentiates the intradermal injection of  xxxg354xxx -induced cutaneous eosinophilia
[13]. these Â®ndings indicate that although  xxxg1180xxx  directly induces
blood eosinophilia by releasing cells from the bone marrow, the
role of  xxxg1180xxx  in induction of tissue eosinophilia is indirect
through priming the cells to easily mobilize from the circulation
to the tissues. the present study found that cyslt antagonists
suppressed not only blood eosinophilia that may be induced by
 xxxg1180xxx , but also lung eosinophilia. furthermore, the forced inhalation of ltd4 induces airway eosinophilia [8Â±10]. thus,
cyslts might produce other eosinophil chemotactic factors
that cause eosinophils primed by  xxxg1180xxx  to migrate from the
circulation to the lung.
in contrast to our view of the mechanisms of antigen-induced
eosinophilia through the production of cyslts and  xxxg1180xxx , another group postulated a different mechanism in rat asthmatic

cysteinyl leukotriene-dependent  xxxg1180xxx  production

models [32,33]. naive recipients (brown norway rats) of cd4Â‡
t cells isolated from the lymph nodes of ova-sensitized donor
rats were challenged by inhalation with ova. the lar was
induced and the numbers of eosinophils and  xxxg1180xxx  mrna positive cells in balf increased, indicating that these responses
were triggered through antigen presentation by airway dendritic
cells or other antigen-presenting cells that activate ovaspeciÂ®c cd4Â‡ t cells [33]. in addition, as these responses were
suppressed by  xxxd2995xxx , the triggering events may induce
cyslt production from unidentiÂ®ed lung cells followed by
 xxxg1180xxx  production, probably from t cells [33]. whether or not
cd4Â‡ t cell-dependent lar and eosinophilia occur in guineapigs is unclear. however, although we found that ear in
guinea-pigs was apparently suppressed by the cyslt antagonist, the early increase in pulmonary resistance in actively
sensitized brown norway rats following antigen inhalation
was hardly attenuated by a cyslt antagonist [32]. it remains
unclear whether the ineffectiveness resulted from the insufÂ®cient release of cyslts immediately after the challenge or
from the failure of the airway smooth muscle to contract in
response to cyslts as has been demonstrated in another strain
of rats [34]. species differences exist between guinea-pigs and
rats in terms of cyslt production and induction of biological
actions.
on the other hand, complete and partial inhibition of the
respective eosinophilia and the lar by cyslt antagonists
and anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody suggest that eosinophils that inÂ®ltrated
the lung are at least partly involved in the lar. we demonstrated that the thromboxane (tx) a2 antagonist, seratrodast,
suppressed the lar by approximately 40% [17], and that abundant txa2 was released from guinea-pig eosinophils in response to non-immunological stimuli [25,35,36]. thus,
migrated eosinophils may participate in the induction of the
lar, probably through txa2 production. in contrast to
the effect of anti- xxxg1180xxx  antibody on the lar in our guineapig model, a humanized monoclonal antibody to  xxxg1180xxx  did not
affect the lar in a double-blind randomized placebocontrolled clinical trial, although the treatment strongly suppressed eosinophilia in the circulation and sputum [37]. this
discrepancy means that the involvement of  xxxg1180xxx  and eosinophils
in the lar in guinea pigs and humans may be species speciÂ®c.
the present results suggest that cyslts, which may be produced by lung mast cells immediately after antigenÂ±antibody
reaction, sequentially induced  xxxg1180xxx  production from immune
component cells via  xxxg599xxx  activation. furthermore,
eosinophils recruited into the lung through the cyslt-and
 xxxg1180xxx -dependent mechanism are probably involved in the occurrence of the lar.
