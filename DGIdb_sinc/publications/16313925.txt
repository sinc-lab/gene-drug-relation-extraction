abstract
 xxxd2314xxx  ophthalmic solution exhibited an improved clinical efficacy over  xxxd1763xxx  in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. to
further characterize its principal mode of action, the phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibitory profile of  xxxd2314xxx  has been examined using human
recombinant enzymes.  xxxd2314xxx , but not the other commonly used anti-allergic ophthalmic solutions including  xxxd1763xxx , ketotifen,
 xxxd3411xxx  and  xxxd2469xxx , potently inhibits purified human  xxxg1697xxx , 4b, 4c and 4d with ic50 values at 54, 65, 239 and 166 nm,
respectively.  xxxd2314xxx  effectively blocks lipopolysaccharide (lps)-induced  xxxg2296xxx  ( xxxg2296xxx , ic50 = 6.2 am) and n-formyl-metleu-phe (fmlp)-induced leukotriene (lt) b4 biosynthesis (ic50 = 2.5 am) in human whole blood, which are 3 and 6-fold more potent than
 xxxd1697xxx , respectively. the attenuated inflammatory and allergic responses from the potent and preferential pde4 inhibition of  xxxd2314xxx  may
have contributed significantly to its beneficial pharmacological responses and distinguishes  xxxd2314xxx  from the other ophthalmic solutions in
the treatment of ocular allergy.

introduction
patients with allergic conjunctivitis suffer from itching,
redness, edema and tearing, accompanied by vascular hyperpermeability in the conjunctiva. topical therapy has been the
preferred treatment choice for both seasonal and perennial
conjunctivitis from the minimal systemic side effect of
ophthalmic solutions (mcgill, 2000; bielory, 2000). of the
8 anti-allergic ophthalmic solutions currently available in
japan,  xxxd1763xxx  (intal), ketotifen (zajiden),  xxxd3411xxx 
( xxxd3411xxx ),  xxxd2469xxx  (ribosutin) and  xxxd2314xxx  ( xxxd2314xxx /
 xxxd2314xxx ) have been widely used. intriguingly,  xxxd2314xxx 
ophthalmic solution is the only medicine exhibited an
improved efficacy over  xxxd1763xxx  in the treatment of

allergic conjunctivitis in a phase 3 clinical study (kitano et
al., 1999).
 xxxd2314xxx  was first introduced in japan as an oral therapy for
the treatment of bronchial asthma and cerebrovascular disorders in 1989 (kawasaki et al., 1992; armstead et al., 1988). it
has been available as an ophthalmic solution for the treatment
of allergic conjunctivitis since 2000 (yokogaki et al., 2002;
noguchi et al., 1994).  xxxd2314xxx  inhibited the pharmacological
effects and the production of slow reacting substances of
anaphylaxis (srs-a) which were later identified as leukotriene
(lt) c4, d4, e4 (ohashi et al., 1986a; nishino et al., 1983).
 xxxd2314xxx  attenuated the production of proinflammatory mediators and cytokines including superoxide,  xxxg2296xxx 
( xxxg2296xxx ), interferon (ifn)-g and interleukin-6 (niwa et al.,
1995; mizuno et al., 2004; feng et al., 2004). in addition,
 xxxd2314xxx  selectively increased vertebral and internal carotid
blood flow without significantly affecting the systemic blood
pressure and cardiac frequency of anesthetized dogs (kudo et
al., 1986).
despite its clinical benefits in the treatment of bronchial
asthma, allergic conjunctivitis and cerebrovascular disorders,

the principal cellular mechanism of action of  xxxd2314xxx  remains to be defined. however, most of its pharmacological
responses could be explained by the activation of camp- and
cgmp-mediated signaling cascades through phosphodiesterase (pde) inhibition. for example,  xxxd2314xxx  was reported to
exhibit its anti-platelet effect via the inhibition of camp-pde
activity in rat and rabbit platelets (ohashi et al., 1986b). its
effects on eosinophils and airways smooth muscle tone were
consistent with its camp-pde inhibition as well (souness et
al., 1994).
the degradation of camp and cgmp in humans is catalyzed by eleven families of pdes encoded by 21 genes. the
camp-specific pde4s (encoded by 4a, 4b, 4c and 4d) and
the dual pde3s (encoded by 3a and 3b) are particularly
abundant in pro-inflammatory and immune cells (souness et
al., 2000; conti et al., 2003). pde4s are attractive therapeutic
targets for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma
and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (copd) since
their inhibition results in attenuated inflammatory and immune
responses (huang et al., 2001; lipworth, 2005). earlier studies
revealed that  xxxd2314xxx  inhibited several tissue pdes with
moderate potency (souness et al., 1994; kishi et al., 2001).
the purpose of the present study is to investigate the intrinsic
potency of  xxxd2314xxx  against human recombinant pdes, its
cellular efficacy in a human whole blood assay, and compare it
with a panel of comparators including the anti-allergics,
 xxxd1763xxx ,  xxxd3411xxx , ketotifen,  xxxd2469xxx , the first
generation pde4 inhibitor (r)- xxxd3142xxx  and the second
generation pde4 inhibitor  xxxd1697xxx  ( xxxd1697xxx ) (torphy et al.,
1999).
materials and methods
chemicals
 xxxd2314xxx  was purchased from wako pure chemical industries ltd (japan).  xxxd1763xxx , ketotifen,  xxxd3411xxx ,  xxxd2469xxx , analytical grade hepes, edta, camp, ultra grade
mgcl2, kcl and reagents were purchased from sigma/aldrich.
 xxxg1697xxx , 4b, 4c and 4d activity assays
the hydrolysis of camp or cgmp by pdes was monitored
as previously described (laliberte et al., 2000). human
pde4a248 and its  xxxg1698xxx ,  xxxg1699xxx  and  xxxg1700xxx  equivalents
were generated by creating glutathione fusion constructs in
frame with the gln– thr (qt) located within ucr2 of the
pde4 sequences. these qt constructs, encoding approximately the maximal common regions of all pde4 variants, were
expressed and purified to homogeneity from sf9 cells. their
pde activity was monitored using 0.1 am [3h]-camp in a
buffer containing 10 mm mgcl2, 1 mm edta, 100 mm kcl
and 20 mm hepes (ph 7.5). compounds were introduced via
2 al of dmso as vehicle which exerted minimal perturbation
on pde activity. the ic50 values were similar to their apparent
k i values under the conditions from the use of 0.1 am camp in
comparison with their similar k m of ¨2 am.

pde selectivity assays
 xxxd2314xxx  was screened against pde1,  xxxg1695xxx ,  xxxg1696xxx ,
pde5,  xxxg1704xxx ,  xxxg1705xxx  and  xxxg1707xxx , similarly to pde4
enzymes. pde1 was isolated from dog heart and its activity
was measured in a buffer containing 0.1 am of [3h]-camp, 50
mm hepes (ph 7.5), 2 mm mgcl2, 50 am edta, 500 am
cacl2, 25 nm calmodulin and 100 mm kcl. the catalytic
domains of human  xxxg1695xxx  and  xxxg1696xxx  were expressed and
purified to homogeneity from e. coli and assayed  xxxd1891xxx  nm of
[3h]-camp (scapin et al., 2004). all other enzymes were
human recombinant expressed in sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system.  xxxg1704xxx  and  xxxg1705xxx  were screened at
0.1 am of [3h]-camp. pde5 and pde9 were screened at 0.1
am of [3h]-cgmp.
 xxxg2296xxx  and ltb4 production in human whole blood
heparinized whole blood from healthy volunteers was
collected and treated as described previously (brideau et al.,
1999). briefly, 500 al aliquots of blood were pre-incubated
with either 2 al of vehicle (dmso) or 2 al  xxxd2314xxx  at varying
concentrations for 15 min at 37 -c. this was followed by the
addition of either 10 al vehicle (pbs) as blanks or 10 al lps (1
ag/ml final concentration). after 24 h incubation at 37 -c,
another 10 al of pbs (blank) or 10 al of lps (1 ag/ml final
concentration) was added to blood and incubated for 30 min at
37 -c. the blood was then challenged with either 10 al of pbs
(blanks) or 10 al of fmlp (1 am final concentration) for 15
min at 37 -c. the blood samples were centrifuged at 1500 g for
10 min at 4 -c. a 50 al aliquot of plasma was mixed with 200
al of methanol to cause protein precipitation and centrifuged as
above. the supernatant was assayed for ltb4 using an eia kit
from cayman chemicals.  xxxg2296xxx  was determined in plasma
diluted in pbs using an eia kit from citron biotechnology.
data analysis
ic50 values were expressed as mean (t se) of n  3
measurements unless otherwise specified. dose – response
curves and ic50 values were analyzed by a nonlinear regression
analysis routine using grafiti (erithacus software).
results and discussion
 xxxd2314xxx  is a potent and preferential inhibitor of human pde4
the present studies focus on the inhibition of four human
pde4 isozymes that have been implicated to play a key role
in mediating the allergic, inflammatory and immune
responses. comparison was performed with (r)- xxxd3142xxx 
and  xxxd1697xxx .  xxxd1697xxx  has been reported to significantly
reduce airway inflammatory responses including the production of  xxxg2296xxx , gm-csf, cd8+-t-lymphocyte and cd68+macrophage in peripheral blood and bronchial biopsies of
copd patients (profita et al., 2003; gamble et al., 2003).

fig. 1. table 1 lists pde inhibitory potency and selectivity
profile of  xxxd2314xxx , (r)- xxxd3142xxx  and  xxxd1697xxx .  xxxd2314xxx  is
a potent pde4 inhibitor with ic50 values of 54 ( xxxg1697xxx ), 65
( xxxg1698xxx ), 239 ( xxxg1699xxx ) and 166 nm ( xxxg1700xxx ), respectively.
 xxxd2314xxx  also weakly inhibited  xxxg1695xxx ,  xxxg1696xxx  and pde5
with ic50 values of 1600, 2700 and 3510 nm, respectively.
this moderate  xxxg1695xxx /3b/5 inhibition is different from the
pde4 specificities of (r)- xxxd3142xxx  and  xxxd1697xxx .
the intrinsic pde4 isozyme potencies of  xxxd2314xxx  reported
here are more potent than those from pde4 preparations
isolated from cell lines and tissues in earlier studies. the
combination of a protein rich environment and the possible
presence of multiple pde4s with each existing in a partially
activated state may have contributed to the reduced apparent
pde4 potency reported earlier. the catalytic machinery of
pde4s, composed of a tightly bound zn2+ and a loosely bound
mg2+ ion, is regulated by serine phosphorylations, through the
modulation of its mg2+ binding affinity (sette and conti, 1996;
huang et al., 2001; laliberte et al., 2002). the use of a partially
activated enzyme preparation alters the catalytic potency of an
inhibitor that binds differentially to the two coexisting pde4
conformers, which may lead to an underestimation of its
intrinsic potency in activity assay. this kinetic effect is
minimized here with the use of the special pde4 constructs,
which are locked in activated states judging from their high
affinity mg2+ responses (ec50 ¨0.5 mm) and the negligible
deviation detected between the catalytic potency of (r) xxxd3142xxx  and its binding constant with the holoenzyme
conformer (liu et al., 2001; laliberte et al., 2002).

clearly distinct from those of other major anti-allergics, and that
the preferential pde4 inhibition by  xxxd2314xxx  may have
contributed, at least in part, to its clinical efficacy in the

of biochemical efficacy of compounds such as the pde4
inhibitors and takes into account of their protein binding
properties. camp elevation through pde4 or  xxxg1695xxx  inhibition
has been demonstrated to down-regulate the production of
various inflammatory cytokines including  xxxg2296xxx  through the
activation of  xxxg1836xxx  and transcriptional downregulation of the nuclear factor-nb pathway, which can lead
to inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade
(brideau et al., 1999; claveau et al., 2004). the potent pde4
inhibition of  xxxd2314xxx  translates to an effective blockage of
lps-stimulated  xxxg2296xxx  production in human whole blood with
an ic50 value of 6200 nm, which is ¨3-fold less potent than
(r)- xxxd3142xxx  and ¨3-fold more potent than the highly protein
bound and clinically efficacious  xxxd1697xxx  (ic50 = 20,000 nm)
(table 2). the potent inhibition of  xxxg2296xxx  release in human
whole blood by  xxxd2314xxx  correlated with its significant
suppression of the elevated  xxxg2296xxx  message in cd4+ cells of
multiple sclerosis patients after 4 weeks of oral treatment (feng
et al., 2004).
 xxxd2314xxx  also effectively suppressed the fmlp-induced
ltb4 biosynthesis in human whole blood with an ic50 of
2500 nm, which is ¨2 and 6-fold more potent than (r) xxxd3142xxx  and  xxxd1697xxx , respectively. previous studies have
identified that the efficient suppression of leukotriene
biosynthesis by pde4 inhibitors is regulated through camp
elevation induced phosphorylation, which in turn prevents 5lipoxygenase translocation in neutrophils and attenuates
cpla2-mediated  xxxd208xxx  mobilization in eosinophils
from atopic donors (denis and riendeau, 1999; flamand et
al., 2002; meliton et al., 2003). pde4 inhibitors are
predicted to be efficacious in the treatment of both acute
and chronic ocular allergy, by attenuating histamine responses,
inhibiting the release of the underlying inflammatory mediators and cytokines, blocking the infiltration of eosinophils,
neutrophils and macrophages, and suppressing t-cell proliferation (torphy, 1998; souness et al., 2000; claveau et al.,
2004).
the present study revealed that  xxxd2314xxx  is a potent and
preferential pde4 inhibitor particularly against the  xxxg1697xxx  and
4b isozymes and it effectively blocked lps-induced  xxxg2296xxx  and
fmlp-induced ltb4 release in human whole blood. in
addition, it reconfirmed that  xxxd2314xxx  is a moderate inhibitor
of  xxxg1695xxx , 3b and  xxxg1701xxx . whether this unique combinatorial
pde potency contributed to its clinical efficacy and improved
tolerability over other first generation pde4 inhibitors remains
to be further studied. it is interesting to note that  xxxd2314xxx  is
about 3-fold less potent against the  xxxg1700xxx  isozyme, which has
been implicated in mediating the emetic response and the

secretory response of pde4 inhibitors through cftr activation (robichaud et al., 2002; liu et al., 2005). in comparison
with its potent  xxxg1697xxx  and 4b inhibition, the approximately
30-fold reduced potency of  xxxd2314xxx  against  xxxg1695xxx  and 3b,
with the ic50 values high above the human exposure level,
supports an insignificant role through  xxxg1695xxx  inhibition in its
clinic responses. on the other hand, the tonically regulated
microvasculature activation from its moderate pde5 inhibition,
through the nitrogenic pathway activation and beneficial in the
resolution of inflammation, could be contributory to its clinical
efficacy and worthy further investigation. in view of the
specific, overlapping and sometimes compensatory natures of
different pdes (giembycz, 2005), comparing the other antiallergics and their major circulating metabolites against all
pdes would be useful in clarifying the contribution from
modulating the camp- and/or cgmp-signaling in their
pharmacological responses.
emerging data also suggests that there appears to be an
increased pde4 expression among atopic patients, which could
render them more sensitive towards pde4 inhibition from the
flux-mediated sensitivity (houslay and milligan, 1997). for
example, t-cells of atopic patients may have an increased
expression of  xxxg1697xxx  and 4b (gantner et al., 1997). the
proliferative response of mononuclear cells of atopic donors is
more sensitive to pde4 inhibition (banner et al., 1995). pde4
inhibitors, but not glucocorticoids, were more potent at
suppressing  xxxg2296xxx  release from mononuclear cells of atopic
donors compared with normal donors, suggesting that they may
have a greater therapeutic potential over steroids in the
treatment of allergic diseases (crocker et al., 1998). taken
together, the present study supports the hypothesis that the antiinflammatory and anti-allergic property of  xxxd2314xxx  from pde4
inhibition may have contributed significantly to its improved
clinical efficacy in the treatment of ocular allergy.
in summary,  xxxd2314xxx  is a potent and preferential pde4
inhibitor which effectively blocks lps-induced  xxxg2296xxx  and
fmlp-induced ltb4 production in human whole blood.
 xxxd2314xxx  is well tolerated in clinic as either an ophthalmic
solution or an oral formulation. the resulting anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic properties of  xxxd2314xxx  through pde4
inhibition differentiate itself from the other anti-allergic
ophthalmic solutions in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.
