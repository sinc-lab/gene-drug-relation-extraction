aims: the clinical indication of  xxxd2899xxx  is unclear, it has been used clinically in conditions with increased
bladder sensation as in cystitis and bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. we explored the effect of
 xxxd2899xxx  on afferent nerve activity by direct measurement of both ad- and c-fibers in the rat, and compared
the outcome with the effects of lidocaine (a local anesthetic) and of acetaminophen (an analgesic). methods: female
sprague–dawley rats were used. under urethane anesthesia, single nerve fibers primarily originating from the
bladder were identified in the l6 dorsal root by electrical stimulation of the left pelvic nerve and by bladder
distention. by conduction velocity (2.5 m/sec) the fibers were defined as ad-fiber or c-fiber. the afferent activity in
response to constant bladder filling was measured before the drug administration. then,  xxxd2899xxx  (0.1–
3 mg/kg) or lidocaine (0.3–3 mg/kg) or acetaminophen (1–10 mg/kg) was administrated intravenously. after drug
administration, the afferent activity of bladder fillings was measured again. results: all drugs significantly
increased bladder compliance, in a dose-dependent way. twenty-eight single afferent fibers (ad-fibers: n ¼ 13,
c-fibers: n ¼ 15) were isolated. intravenous administration of  xxxd2899xxx  significantly decreased dosedependently only the ad-fiber but not the c-fiber activity. also acetaminophen significantly decreased only ad-fiber
activity, but it was not dose-dependently completely. lidocaine inhibited both the ad- and c-fiber activities.
conclusions: this study shows that  xxxd2899xxx  can directly inhibit the mechanosensitive ad-fibers in the
normal rat bladder. this finding might explain its clinical effect in conditions of bladder hypersensitivity.

introduction

animals

 xxxd2899xxx  (2,6-diamino-3-[phenyl-azo]pyridine)
hydrochloride has been used clinically as a local anesthetic/
analgesic to provide symptomatic relief of pain in conditions
such as cystitis and urethritis.1 – 3 in addition, this drug is being
used as a therapeutic option in patients with chronic bladder
pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (bps/ic) beside hydrodistention, amitriptyline, or  xxxd2878xxx .4,5
but there is little information available on the mode of action
of the drug including sensory mechanisms, which have been
referred afferent functions in the rat.
the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of
 xxxd2899xxx  on afferent nerve activity of both ad- and
c-fibers with a direct measurement technique established in
our laboratory.6,7 in addition, we compared the results with
the effects of a local anesthetic (lidocaine) and an analgesic
(acetaminophen) due to the potential effect of  xxxd2899xxx .

twenty-two adult female sprague–dawley rats weighing
208–297 g were used. the rats were maintained under
optimal laboratory conditions with a 12:12-h light:dark cycle,
and free access to food pellets and tap water. the rats were
anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg intraperitoneally). body
temperature was maintained by a heated blanket at 38 c.
after the experiments, the animals were killed by an overdose
of urethane.

materials and methods

the protocol was approved by the animal ethics committee
of antwerp university faculty of medicine.

placed around the pelvic nerve. the ureters were ligated close
to the bladder. a polyethylene catheter (clay-adams pe-50,
parsippany, nj) was inserted in the bladder through the dome,
and secured. the lumbosacral spinal cord was exposed by
laminectomy. both l6 dorsal roots were cut close to their
entrance to the spinal cord. fine filaments were dissected from
the left l6 dorsal root and placed across shielded bipolar silver
electrodes. afferent fibers originating from the bladder were
identified by electrical stimulation (0.5-msec square wave
pulses, sen-3301; nihon kohden, tokyo, japan) of the pelvic
nerve and by bladder distention with saline. the filaments
were teased until a maximum of four clearly different unitary
action potentials were evoked by electrical stimulation. these
action potentials were discriminated by the spike2 (ced,
cambridge, uk) impulse shape recognition program. conduction velocity (cv) was calculated from the latency of response
to electrical stimulation and the conduction distance between
stimulation and recording sites. fibers were grouped based on
cv. those with a cv < 2.5 m/sec were considered to correspond with unmyelinated c-fibers and those with cv  2.5 m/
sec to thinly myelinated ad-fibers.8
single fiber afferent activity was recorded during constant
filling cystometry with 0.08 ml/min saline at room temperature. filling continued until an intravesical pressure of
30 cmh2o was reached and then saline was evacuated by
opening the catheter. during filling, the urethra was clamped to
prevent leakage. the afferent activity caused by pelvic nerve
stimulation was also recorded before and after bladder filling
and confirmed to correspond with that caused by bladder
filling.
experimental procedure

at the beginning of the experiments, consecutive recording
was repeated three times at 5-min intervals to evaluate the
reproducibility. the third recording served as the baseline
value. after 2 min,  xxxd2899xxx  (0.1–3 mg/kg) or lidocaine (0.3–3 mg/kg) or acetaminophen (1–10 mg/kg) was
administrated intravenously (i.v.). three minutes after drug
administration, bladder fillings were performed. each bladder
filling was repeated at a same time schedule from lower to
higher doses. moreover, each interval was 5 min between
bladders filling.
the relationship of nerve activity to pressure or volume
was established by comparing nerve activity and intravesical
pressure at 1-sec intervals. these values were then averaged at
5 cmh2o interval of pressure or at 5 equal divisions (0–20%,
20–40%, 40–60%, 60–80%, and 80–100%) of volume in the
filling phase. average total unitary activity was also calculated in function of intravesical pressure or volume. afferent
nerve activity is expressed as a percentage of baseline activity,
integrated for the whole filling phase.
drugs

all drugs ( xxxd2899xxx  hydrochloride, lidocaine, and
acetaminophen (paracetamol) were purchased from sigma

chemical company (st. louis, mo), and dissolved in saline,
the concentrations are expressed as those of the respective
salts. all drugs were administrated i.v. through a polyethylene
catheter (pe-50) placed in the right external jugular vein.
the doses were chosen corresponding with application for
the treatment in human and according to previous studies
in the rat.9 – 12

averaged p-values <0.05 are considered statistically significant.
results

in all 28 single-unit afferent fibers were isolated from
22 rats. thirteen units corresponded to criteria for myelinated
ad-fibers (cv: 6.55  0.99 m/sec), and 15 for unmyelinated
c-fibers (cv: 1.28  0.08 m/sec). after all drugs administration,
bladder compliance significantly increased dose-dependently
(table i).
after  xxxd2899xxx  and acetaminophen administrations, the afferent activity of ad-fibers in response to bladder
filling decreased significantly (figs. 1a, 3a, and 4a,e), and the
inhibitory effect of acetaminophen was lower than that of
 xxxd2899xxx , and was similar with a dose of 3 and 10 mg/
kg. in contrast, the c-fiber activity in response to bladder
filling was not affected by these administrations at any doses
(figs. 1b, 3b, and 4b,f). on the other hand, after lidocaine
administration, the afferent activity of both ad- and c-fibers
in response to bladder filling decreased significantly (figs. 2
and 4c,d). the inhibitory effect of lidocaine on the activity of
c-fibers was significantly more pronounced than in ad-fibers.
almost all drug effects on the afferent activities were similar
based on both volume and pressure.

discussion

we have already evaluated controls in a sufficient number
of the same types of rats in our previous study with the same
technique.6 in these controls, we used saline as a vehicle, and
with time-matching as performed in the present study. these
control studies that we have not repeated here showed no
influences on bladder compliance and afferent activities.
in contrast, all drugs significantly increased the bladder
compliance dose-dependently in this study. these results
indicate that these drugs can change the bladder wall tone in
the rat especially at higher dose. the activity of ad-fibers was
significantly decreased by  xxxd2899xxx  administration.
on the other hand, the responses of c-fibers did not change.
myelinated ad-fibers, which are located primarily within the
detrusor, are stimulated by stretching during the phase of

effects of  xxxd2899xxx  on rat bladder afferent

bladder filling and convey sensations of fullness.13 the
decreased response on volume of ad-fibers after  xxxd2899xxx  administration would be possibly caused by relaxation
of the detrusor, as bladder compliance significantly increased.
however, the ad-fiber activity based on pressure was also
significantly decreased and c-fiber activities did not change.
the properties of mechanoreceptors with c-fibers were found
indistinguishable from those with ad-fibers in the rat.8,14
therefore, it is more likely that the  xxxd2899xxx  can

directly inhibit the ad-fibers of primary bladder afferents, but
does not have much action on c-fibers.
lidocaine significantly decreased the afferent activities of
both ad- and c-fibers, and the inhibitory effect on the c-fiber
was slightly more than on the ad-fiber. local anesthetic agents
inhibit directly voltage-gated naþ channels, which are
responsible for the initiation and propagation of action
potentials in both nerve and muscle cells.15 it is a widespread
belief in anesthetic pharmacology that impulses in nerve

fibers of small and unmyelinated fibers, such as c-fibers, are
blocked by lower concentrations of local anesthetics than
those of larger myelinated fibers, such as ad-fibers.16 – 21 the
present results are consistent with these previous studies.
recently, it was reported that though lidocaine inhibited both
ad- and c-fiber activities in experiments on the sciatic single
fiber nerve in the rat, c-fibers were less inhibited by lidocaine
than ad-fibers.22,23 the discrepancy between these studies
may be due to different types of nerve fiber and/or afferent
experimental procedure. morikawa et al.11 reported that
lidocaine i.v. administration significantly increased the bladder capacity and pressure threshold on cystometrogram in the
rat, which are related to the afferent functions. this study may
support this previous observation.
acetaminophen significantly decreased the activities of
ad-fibers, but not c-fibers. although these overall observations
were similar to the effect of  xxxd2899xxx , the inhibitory
effect of ad-fibers was not different of the 3 and 10 mg/kg
doses and this number was lower than that of  xxxd2899xxx . angelico et al.9 used a higher dose than in the present
study, and demonstrated that acetaminophen significantly
increased bladder volume capacity in the conscious rat. they
also showed that only a high dose of acetaminophen
significantly increased bladder capacity in cystitis induced
by acetic acid as compared with other analgesics because of
the different action site of acetaminophen, which has been
contributed to a third cyclooxygenase (cox) isozyme, cox-3.24
in addition, joshi et al.25 reported that standard analgesics
(including acetaminophen) did not inhibit the cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis bladder. guerios et al.26 demonstrated
that pre-treatment with lidocaine attenuated referred hyperalgesia associated with cystitis. it is conceivable that this
different inhibitory effect on chemical cystitis can be
explained by the different effect of lidocaine and acetaminophen on single afferent ad- and c-fiber as found in this study.
neurourology and urodynamics doi 10.1002/nau

our previous study demonstrated that a b3-adrenoceptor
(ar) agonist decreases ad-fiber but not c-fiber activity in
saline-filled bladder. but a b3-ar agonist inhibited c-fiber
activity elicited by intravesical  xxxd1903xxx  (pge2)instillation.6 this showed that the inhibitory effect of b3-ar
agonist on pge2-induced facilitation of mechanosensitive
c-fibers might be mediated indirectly. the effects of  xxxd2899xxx  and acetaminophen look similar to the result of a
b3-ar agonist. acetaminophen decreases pg concentrations in
vivo,24 and pgs are involved in the physiological regulation of
micturition during reflex activation of the urinary bladder.27,28
therefore, it is possible that the acetaminophen effect in this
study is due to an action on the pg’s synthesis. on the other
hand, standard analgesics (including acetaminophen) did not
significantly inhibit cystitis in previous studies,9,25 whereas
there have been reports showing a positive effect of
 xxxd2899xxx  in ic in human studies.4,5 thus, it is possible
that the mechanisms on the afferent ad nerve fibers from
analgesic are different than the action causing the  xxxd2899xxx  effect.
to our knowledge, there has been no investigation on the
effect of  xxxd2899xxx  on single afferent activity in the rat
bladder, before. in the results,  xxxd2899xxx  can directly
inhibit the ad-fibers of primary bladder afferents, but does not
have much action on c-fibers. previous study demonstrated
that the bladders ad afferents in cats with feline ic
significantly increased the slope of pressure-firing curves
compared with afferents in normal cats.29 although the
species differ, it is conceivable that  xxxd2899xxx  has a
symptomatic effect in human cystitis and bps/ic through an
action on the afferent ad-fiber activity. furthermore, there is a
need for future experiments in pathologic models as a cystitis
model, a spinal cord injured model, and so on. it may be that
 xxxd2899xxx  can also affect the c-fiber function directly in
such conditions.

values are expressed as a percentage of baseline activity (mean  sem). after  xxxd2899xxx  administration, the
ad-fiber activities significantly decreased (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01: significant difference from base). the inhibitory
effect of  xxxd2899xxx  on the activity of ad-fibers was more pronounced when analyzed based on volume
changes than pressure changes (a).  xxxd2899xxx  administration did not affect the c-fiber activities (b). after
lidocaine administration, both ad- and c-fiber activities significantly decreased (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01: significant
difference from base). the inhibitory effect of lidocaine on the activity of c-fibers was slightly more pronounced
than the changes of ad-fibers (c,d). after acetaminophen administration, the ad-fiber activities significantly
decreased (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01: significant difference from base, e). acetaminophen administration did not affect
the c-fiber activities (f).

conclusions

this study from the bladder in l6 dorsal root of the rat
shows that  xxxd2899xxx  can inhibit the mechanosensitive
ad-fibers, and not the c-fiber. the effect of  xxxd2899xxx  is
similar to that of acetaminophen, but not to that of lidocaine.
these results indicate that  xxxd2899xxx  may have a role
in the symptomatic treatment of cystitis or urethritis by a
direct effect on bladder afferent nerves.
