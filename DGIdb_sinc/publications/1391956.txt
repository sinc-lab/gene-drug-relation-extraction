 xxxg741xxx  interacts with two sites on monocytes with different functional activities.  studies were performed to elucidate the functional significance of  xxxg741xxx  interactions at the monocyte membrane in the presence and absence of  xxxg749xxx , with respect to prothrombin and  xxxg752xxx  cleavage.  xxxg741xxx -catalyzed prothrombin activation at the monocyte surface was absolutely dependent on the addition of  xxxg749xxx , indicating that thrombin was generated solely by a membrane-bound complex of factors va and xa. in contrast, in the absence of added  xxxg749xxx ,  xxxg741xxx  bound to monocytes catalyzed the cleavage of  xxxg752xxx  to the nonenzymatic intermediate  xxxg752xxx  alpha through a reaction that was dependent on both monocyte and  xxxg741xxx  concentration. at limiting  xxxg741xxx  concentration, added  xxxg749xxx  inhibited the  xxxg741xxx -catalyzed cleavage of  xxxg752xxx , suggesting that a monocyte-bound complex of factors va and xa did not recognize  xxxg752xxx  as a substrate. these combined data suggest that  xxxg741xxx  interacts with the monocyte through two sites which can be distinguished by their requirement for added  xxxg749xxx  and their expression of different functional activities. both functional sites could be distinguished also by their differential susceptibility to inhibition by a monoclonal antibody directed against the light chain of  xxxg749xxx  (alpha-hfv1). at the monocyte surface, the  xxxg749xxx /xa-catalyzed activation of prothrombin was maximally inhibited with 0.25 mumol/l alpha-hfv1, whereas 1.0 mumol/l alpha-hfv1 was required to effect 50% inhibition of the  xxxg741xxx -catalyzed cleavage of  xxxg752xxx . the ability of  xxxg749xxx  to modulate  xxxg741xxx  substrate specificity was investigated further.  xxxg741xxx  bound to thrombin-activated platelets either through platelet-released  xxxg749xxx  or added  xxxg749xxx  did not cleave  xxxg752xxx . consistent with this result, a plasma concentration of  xxxg752xxx  had no effect on thrombin generation catalyzed by a platelet-bound complex of factors va and xa. in marked contrast,  xxxg741xxx  bound to phospholipid vesicles either independently or in complex with  xxxg749xxx  catalyzed  xxxg752xxx  cleavage with equal efficiency. these combined data indicate that  xxxg749xxx  bound to cell surfaces modulates  xxxg741xxx  substrate specificity, whereas no discriminatory effect is conferred by  xxxg749xxx  bound to phospholipid vesicles. thus, by providing two distinct sites at its membrane surface, the monocyte modulates  xxxg741xxx  binding and the functional activity expressed by the bound enzyme, depending on the availability of  xxxg749xxx .
