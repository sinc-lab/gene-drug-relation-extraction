summary the oxytocin system plays a significant role in modulating stress responses in animals
and humans; perturbations in this system may contribute to the pathogenesis of psychiatric
disorder. attempts to identify clinically relevant genetic variants in the oxytocin system have
yielded associations between polymorphisms of the  xxxg1642xxx  ( xxxg1642xxx ) gene and both
autism and major depression. to date, however, little is known about how such variants affect
brain structures implicated in these disorders. applying a manual tracing procedure to highresolution structural magnetic resonance images, amygdala volumes were measured in 51 girls
genotyped on  xxxg1642xxx  rs2254298(g>a), a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with psychopathology. results of this study indicate that despite having greater gray matter volume,
participants homozygous for the g allele were characterized by smaller volumes of both left
and right amygdala than were carriers of the a allele. a subsequent whole-brain voxel-based
morphometry analysis revealed additional genotype-mediated volumetric group differences in
the posterior brain stem and dorsomedial anterior cingulate cortex. these findings highlight one
neurobiological pathway by which oxytocin gene variants may increase risk for psychopathology.
further research is needed to characterize the mechanism by which this polymorphism contributes to anatomical variability and to identify functional correlates of these alterations in regional
brain volume.

attention for its role in modulating stress reactivity and

emotionality. the oxytocin system regulates hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal (hpa) axis functioning. research with
rodents, for example, indicates that oxytocin buffers both
the behavioral and corticosteroid responses to acute stress
(e.g., windle et al., 1997). in humans, oxytocin is posited to
blunt stress reactivity by decreasing the amount of  xxxd1752xxx  (acth) released in response to  xxxd1752xxx 
releasing hormone (crh; page et al., 1990), thereby diminishing cortisol secretion. in addition, brain oxytocin may
directly modulate neural dynamics within the amygdala, a
site of high  xxxg1642xxx  concentration (veinante and
freund-mercier, 1997). ebner et al. (2004) demonstrated that

levels of oxytocin are increased in the rat amygdala under
conditions of emotional and physical stress. upon release,
oxytocin is posited to bind to functional receptors within the
central nucleus, enhancing gabaergic transmission and leading to the inhibition of amygdalar output to the hypothalamus
and brainstem (huber et al., 2005), regions critical to the
generation of stress and fear responses. indeed, several
functional neuroimaging studies with humans have now
demonstrated modulation of amygdala reactivity in vivo.
specifically, intranasal administration of oxytocin has been
shown to attenuate ordinarily robust amygdala responses to
emotional faces and threatening scenes (e.g., kirsch et al.,
2005). moreover, consistent with the formulation that oxytocin mediates decreases in amygdalar output to brainstem
regions, kirsch et al. (2005) demonstrated that the observed
reduction in amygdala reactivity was accompanied by a
corresponding decrease in the functional coupling of the
amygdala and the brainstem.
considered collectively, these findings raise the possibility
that variations or perturbations within the oxytocin system
are involved in the pathogenesis of psychopathology. in fact,
there is increasing interest in identifying variants in the genes
that code for oxytocin and its receptor, particularly in the
context of elucidating heritable risk factors for psychiatric
disorders. among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps)
that have been associated with autism, the g-allele of the
rs2254298 polymorphism of the  xxxg1642xxx  [ xxxg1642xxx ]
gene (located on chromosome 3p25.3) appears to be overtransmitted in certain autistic populations (jacob et al.,
2007) and central to several haplotypes associated with risk
for autism (lerer et al., 2007). moreover, costa et al. (2009)
have documented an increased frequency of the g allele in
individuals diagnosed with unipolar depression.
given the neuromodulatory functions of oxytocin in the
amygdala and the associations between snps of the  xxxg1642xxx  gene
and autism and depression, it is noteworthy that abnormal
amygdala structure has been implicated in the pathophysiology of both of these disorders. for example, in a recent metaanalysis, hamilton et al. (2008) concluded that unmedicated
major depression is consistently associated with decreased
amygdala volume; several investigators have also reported
decreased amygdala volume in adolescents and adults with
autism (e.g., nacewicz et al., 2006). nacewicz et al. (2006)
further describe an association between smaller amygdala
volume and social impairment in autistic individuals, supporting the hypothesis that variation in amygdala volume has
significant behavioral correlates, if not consequences.
although researchers are beginning to elucidate the nature of the interaction of oxytocin and amygdala function, we
know little about how genetic variation in the oxytocin
system may affect amygdala structure. given the role of
oxytocin in diminishing levels of corticosteroids, which with
chronic exposure may lead to atrophy of amygdala dendrites
(mitra and sapolsky, 2008),  xxxg1642xxx  gene polymorphisms may affect amygdala volume beginning at a relatively young age. the present study was designed to explore
this formulation. we recruited a healthy adolescent sample,
one likely to exhibit the structural brain phenotypes consistent with risk for psychopathology without having yet experienced the onset of a disorder. because amygdala volume
has been shown to increase throughout adolescence in males
but to remain stable in females (giedd et al., 1996), we

d.j. furman et al.
restricted our sample to young females. using a manual
tracing procedure, we examined the influence of the
(g>a) polymorphism on amygdala volume in this sample.
given that the  xxxg1642xxx  rs2254298 g allele has been associated
with disorders characterized by decreased amygdala
volumes, and that diminished oxytocin system activity may
adversely affect amygdala neurons by altering levels of
circulating corticosteroids, we hypothesized that participants who carry two copies of the g allele would have smaller
amygdalae than would a-allele carriers. in addition, we
conducted voxel-based morphometry (vbm) to explore
whether the  xxxg1642xxx  rs2254298 genotype affects the volume
of other regions of the brain that have been found to be
associated with stress, fear, and anxiety.

2. methods
2.1. sample
participants were 51 girls between the ages of 10 and 15,
recruited with their mothers through advertisements in the
local community as part of a larger study on the intergenerational transmission of psychopathology. given potential
interactions between gonadal steroid hormones and oxytocin
actions, we obtained self-reports of menarcheal status from
the girls. all participants gave informed assent in accordance
with the stanford university institutional review board.

2.2. assessment of psychopathology
initial telephone interviews with the participants’ mothers
were used to exclude girls with learning disabilities or behavior or conduct problems, frequent correlates of autism and
related disorders. trained interviewers assessed the diagnostic status of the girls by administering the kiddie schedule
for affective disorders and schizophrenia for school-age
children-present and lifetime version (k-sads-pl; kaufman
et al., 1997). any girl who received a current or past psychiatric diagnosis was excluded from the study. nevertheless,
to assess possible group differences in subclinical depressive
symptomatology, participants completed the short form (10item) of the children’s depression inventory (cdi-s; kovacs,
1985).

2.3. genotyping
participants were genotyped from saliva collected using the
oragene kit (dna genotek inc.; ontario, canada). amplification of  xxxg1642xxx  rs2254298 was performed with the primers 50 tga aag cag agg ttg tgt gga cag g-30 and the antisense
primer 50 -aac gcc cac ccc agt ttc ttc-30 under standard
conditions. pcr products were electrophoresed through 10%
polyacrylamide gel at 150 v for 40 min. a 10 bp marker was
used to measure the fragments’ size. the a allele yields
164 bp, 136 bp and 8 bp fragments, whereas the g allele
yields 164 bp, 101 bp, 34 and 8 bp fragments.

2.4. mr image acquisition and processing
anatomical images were obtained on a 1.5t ge scanner using
a t1-weighted spgr sequence (tr = 8.924 ms; te = 1.792 ms;

 xxxg1642xxx  gene associated with amygdala volume
flip angle = 158, in-plane resolution = 0.859 mm2, slice thickness = 1.5 mm). using statistic parametric mapping (spm8)
software (wellcome department of imaging neuroscience,
london, uk; www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), images were
checked for scanner artifacts and anatomical anomalies,
and manually reoriented in consultation with a canonical
template image.

2.5. amygdala tracing procedure
images were resampled to 1.0 mm isotropic voxels prior to
tracing. manual tracings of the left and right amygdala were
performed in reoriented native space using the insight toolkit’s
snap program (www.itksnap.org). amygdala boundaries were
identified consistent with specifications outlined by sheline
et al. (1998). once initial boundaries were defined, minor
adjustments were made in each of the three views to account
for individual differences in anatomy. all amygdalae were
traced by a single experienced rater (df) who was blind to
participant genotype at the time of tracing. ten amygdalae
were retraced by an independent trained rater to assess interrater reliability (intraclass correlation, r = .83). final volumes
obtained from itk-snap were divided by total brain volume
(gray matter + white matter volume, extracted using image
segmentation in spm8) to yield adjusted amygdala volumes, a
technique used to control for differences in head size.

2.6. statistical analysis
between-group comparisons of gray and white matter volumes
were conducted using independent samples t-tests. across the
entire sample, raw right amygdala volume was correlated
significantly with both age (r = 0.33, p = 0.02) and cdi-s score
(r = 0.26, p = 0.06); therefore, we controlled for these variables in all subsequent analyses. separate univariate analyses
of covariance (ancovas) were conducted to assess the effect
of genotype on raw and adjusted amygdala volumes.

893
friston (2005). a diffeomorphic image registration technique
(dartel; ashburner, 2007) was then used to iteratively build
group tissue class templates and estimate the non-linear
deformations that best align the individual segmentations
to them. jacobian modulated warped gray and white matter
segmented images, produced using the dartel tool suite,
were smoothed with a gaussian kernel of 8 mm fwhm.
resulting image voxels measured 1.5 mm3.
statistics were conducted on smoothed, modulated gray
matter segmentations with participants’ age and total brain
volume entered as covariates. the threshold for resultant tstatistic maps was set at p < 0.001, uncorrected. statistical
parametric maps were subsequently corrected for familywise error ( p < 0.05) and non-stationary cluster extent, a
correction used to account for inhomogeneities in data
smoothness (gaser, http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm/
non-stationary-cluster-extent-correction).

3. results
3.1. participant characteristics
participant characteristics are presented in table 1. the
sample did not contain any participants with the a/a genotype. genotype frequencies were in hardy—weinberg equilibrium, x2(2) = 1.76, p > 0.05. there were no differences
between the two genotype groups in either age
(t[49] = .165) or cdi-s scores (t[49] = .972), both ps > 0.05.
seven participants did not provide data on menarcheal status; the data for the remaining participants yielded no significant group difference (x2[1] = .39).

3.2. white and gray matter volume
the two groups did not differ in total white matter volume
(t[49] = 1.59, p > 0.05); however, g-allele homozygotes had
greater total gray matter volume than did heterozygotes
(t[49] = 2.70, p = 0.01) (see table 1).

2.7. voxel-based morphometry (vbm)

voxels; non-stationarity adjusted cluster-level p = 0.032).
conversely, compared with g-allele homozygotes, g/a heterozygotes had greater volume in the posterior brainstem
(peak t = 4.51; mni x,y,z = 9, 33, 11; 304 voxels; nonstationarity adjusted cluster-level p = 0.034).

4. discussion
this study provides the first evidence of a neuroanatomical
correlate of an  xxxg1642xxx  polymorphism. using a
manual tracing technique, we documented a reduction in
total amygdala volume, despite greater overall gray matter
volume, in healthy female  xxxg1642xxx  rs2254298 g-allele homozygotes relative to g/a heterozygotes. notably, decreased
amygdala volume has also been found to be associated with

figure 2 template sections showing suprathreshold voxels in the comparison of segmented whole brain gray matter estimates of
 xxxg1642xxx  rs2254298 g/g homozygotes and g/a heterozygotes. dorsomedial acc volume was significantly ( p < 0.05, non-stationarity
adjusted cluster-level) greater in g-allele homozygotes, whereas brainstem volume was increased in carriers of the a allele. notes:
 xxxg1642xxx  =  xxxg1642xxx ; acc = anterior cingulate cortex.

 xxxg1642xxx  gene associated with amygdala volume
both unipolar (e.g., hamilton et al., 2008) and bipolar (e.g.,
kalmar et al., 2009) depression, as well as with autism,
though results in this disorder have been mixed (howard
et al., 2000; nacewicz et al., 2006). further, the present
finding is consistent with documented increases in total gray
matter volume in adolescent males with autism spectrum
disorder (hazlett et al., 2006).
although the relation between the structure and function
of the amygdala is not fully understood, mounting evidence
suggests that increased size of neuroanatomical structures
does not invariably predict increased neural activity; in fact,
smaller amygdala volume has been found to be associated
with increased neural activation to emotionally valenced
stimuli in depressed individuals (kalmar et al., 2009). further
research is needed to relate the current finding of smaller
amygdala volumes in g-allele homozygotes to alterations in
metabolism and reactivity. in particular, if the volumetric
reductions that characterize g-allele homozygotes are also
associated with increased amygdala reactivity, this reactivity
may constitute one pathway by which  xxxg1642xxx  polymorphisms
confer risk for psychopathology. thus, examining amygdala
reactivity in these individuals would allow us to gain a better
understanding of the dynamics relating genes, anatomical
structure, and neural functioning.
the effect of the  xxxg1642xxx  polymorphism on amygdala volume
may be mediated, in part, by exposure to corticosteroids.
brown et al. (2007) reported that patients who received at
least six months of corticosteroid treatment had smaller
amygdalae and, further, that right amygdala volume was
inversely correlated with length of treatment. given that
oxytocin is posited to buffer the effects of stress by dampening both hpa-axis and amygdala reactivity, as described
above, it is possible that decreased transcription, or sensitivity, of oxytocin receptors leads to greater exposure to
cortisol, which in turn affects amygdala volume. future
research could profitably examine whether the effect of
 xxxg1642xxx  genotype on amygdala volume is mediated by exposure
to cumulative stress or cortisol.
given the documented associations among oxytocin, the
amygdala, and the brainstem, it is noteworthy that our vbm
analysis revealed decreased volume in a region of caudal
midbrain in g-allele homozygotes relative to carriers of the a
allele. interestingly, several lines of research have implicated altered brainstem morphometry in the pathophysiology of autism. specifically, smaller brainstem volumes have
been reported in young autistic children (e.g., hashimoto
et al., 1993). jou et al. (2008) not only found brainstem
volumes to be decreased in a young autistic sample, but also
demonstrated that regardless of diagnosis, total brainstem
gray matter volume correlated positively with severity of
sensory sensitivity, suggesting direct functional consequences of such volumetric reductions.
in our sample we found genotype-mediated differences in a
region of brainstem proximal to the periaqueductal gray (pag).
we should note that while the use of a less stringent statistical
threshold revealed gray matter differences in more medial
regions of the midbrain, the pag may be of central concern
when considering oxytocin-mediated effects on anxiety. this
region, implicated in fear behavior and arousal (ledoux et al.,
1988), is the target of heavy reciprocal projections from the
central nucleus of the amygdala (rizvi et al., 1991). research
has demonstrated that activation of the brainstem is signifi-

895
cantly attenuated following oxytocin administration (baumgartner et al., 2008), likely through the mediation of activity
via these amygdalar projections (huber et al., 2005). complementing this indirect influence of oxytocin on brainstem
activity, functional oxytocin receptors have been identified
within the human central gray, among other brainstem regions
(loup et al., 1989), suggesting that the neuropeptide directly
affects brainstem structure and function. indeed, direct
administration of oxytocin into the periaqueductal gray has
been shown to attenuate anxiety-related behaviors in postpartum rats (figueira et al., 2008).
although we did not have a priori hypotheses regarding
the effect of rs2254298 genotype on acc, the finding of
increased acc volume in g-allele homozygotes is interesting
for a number of reasons. investigators have suggested that
dorsal acc is involved in the ‘‘felt unpleasantness’’ of both
physical and social pain, perhaps as a consequence of, or
precursor to, its role in allocating attentional resources
(eisenberger and lieberman, 2004). appropriately, given this
formulation, abnormal function or structure in this region has
been noted in pediatric anxiety disorder (mcclure et al.,
2007), obsessive-compulsive disorder (rosenberg and keshavan, 1998; ursu et al., 2003), and disorders along the autism
spectrum (di martino et al., 2009), each of which has also
been associated with the oxytocin system. importantly, while
 xxxg1642xxx  binding has been localized within the rat
cingulate cortex, expression in this structure seems to be
limited to early development (tribollet et al., 1989).
although comparable data are not available in humans, it
is possible that transient oxytocin actions in the developing
brain have lasting and consequential effects, especially when
considering genetic variants, present from the earliest stages
of development.
we should note four limitations of the current study. first,
because our sample was composed exclusively of adolescent
females, we could not examine the generalizability of the
obtained results to other age groups and to males. second,
the interpretation of our results is limited by the current
paucity of information concerning the  xxxg1642xxx  rs2254298 polymorphism. it is likely that this snp is in linkage disequilibrium
with one or more unknown functional loci; additional
research is required to identify the critical genes that may
mediate the observed associations. third, the group difference in amygdala volume obtained using manual tracing was
not corroborated by our vbm analysis. it is likely that our
ability to detect differences in amygdala volume using this
exploratory procedure was limited by our sample size; studies using vbm that have reported significant group differences in amygdala volume have used larger group sample
sizes (e.g., pezawas et al., 2005). in addition, vbm has been
found to be less sensitive than is manual tracing in detecting
certain volumetric effects within the amygdala (good et al.,
2002). finally, given the scanning resolution used in this
study, we were not able to localize the observed volumetric
differences to particular sub-regions of the amygdala. nevertheless, we were able to document an overall reduction in
amygdala volume in individuals who are homozygous for the
 xxxg1642xxx  rs2254298 g allele. scanning protocols targeting the
amygdala may be able to localize genotype-mediated volumetric and functional differences to regions of the amygdala
known to be particularly dense in  xxxg1642xxx . examining the
effects of this and related polymorphisms on neuroanatomy,

896
neural function, and hpa-axis activity will increase our
understanding of how the oxytocin system affects the stress
response and risk for psychopathology.
