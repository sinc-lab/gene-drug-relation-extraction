in cardiomyocytes

1. iks, the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, figures prominently in the
repolarization of heart cells. the k+ channel gene  xxxg1268xxx  is mutated in the heritable long qt
( xxxg1268xxx ) syndrome. heterologous coexpression of  xxxg1268xxx  and the accessory protein mink yields
an iks-like current. nevertheless, the links between  xxxg1268xxx  and cardiac iks are largely
inferential.
2. since the  xxxg1268xxx  syndrome mutant  xxxg1268xxx -g306r suppresses channel activity when
coexpressed with wild-type  xxxg1268xxx  in a heterologous system, overexpression of this mutant
in cardiomyocytes should reduce or eliminate native iks if  xxxg1268xxx  is indeed the major
molecular component of this current. to test this idea, we created the adenovirus
adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r, which overexpresses  xxxg1268xxx -g306r channels.
3. in > 60 % of neonatal mouse myocytes, a sizable iks could be measured using perforated-patch
recordings (8.0 ± 1.6 pa pf_1, n = 13). iks was increased by  xxxd1742xxx  and blocked by clofilium
or  xxxd2343xxx  but not by e-4031. while cells infected with a reporter virus expressing only
green fluorescent protein (gfp) displayed iks similar to that in uninfected cells,
adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r-infected cells showed a significantly reduced iks (2.4 ± 1.1 pa pf_1,
n = 10, p < 0.01) when measured 60–72 h after infection. similar results were observed in
adult guinea-pig myocytes (5.9 ± 1.2 pa pf_1, n = 9, for control vs. 0.1 ± 0.1 pa pf_1, n = 5,
for adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r-infected cells).
4. we conclude that  xxxg1268xxx  is the major molecular component of iks. our results further
establish a dominant-negative mechanism for the g306r  xxxg1268xxx  syndrome mutation.
mutations of the  xxxg1268xxx  (or  xxxg1268xxx ) gene are responsible
for many cases of inherited long qt ( xxxg1268xxx ) syndrome
(wang et al. 1996) including the autosomal dominant
romano-ward syndrome (rws; ward, 1964). the  xxxg1268xxx 
syndrome consists of a prolonged qt interval on the
electrocardiogram, syncope, ventricular arrhythmias
and sudden death. these clinical findings imply that
 xxxg1268xxx  is essential for proper cardiac repolarization.
when coexpressed with the regulatory protein mink in
heterologous systems,  xxxg1268xxx  produces currents with
biophysical and pharmacological properties resembling
the slowly activating component (i.e. iks) of the delayedrectifier potassium currents observed in native cardiac cells
(barhanin et al. 1996; sanguinetti et al. 1996). despite

these compelling lines of evidence, the links between
 xxxg1268xxx  and cardiac iks remain largely inferential.
in the present study, we sought to confirm  xxxg1268xxx  as a
critical molecular component of iks by overexpressing a
 xxxg1268xxx  construct carrying the dominant negative
romano-ward mutation g306r (wang et al. 1996;
wollnik et al. 1997) in cardiomyocytes via viral gene
transfer and looking for changes in native iks. we found
that virally mediated overexpression of this construct
results in significantly diminished iks, confirming the
critical role of  xxxg1268xxx  in iks and further establishing a
dominant-negative mechanism for the g306r disease
mutant.

methods
the present investigation conformed to the standards of the us
national institutes of health regarding the care and use of
laboratory animals, and was performed in accordance with the
guidelines of the animal care and use committee of the johns
hopkins university.
isolation of ventricular myocytes
neonatal myocytes were prepared as previously described (nuss et
al. 1994). briefly, ventricles of neonatal mice (1–2 days old, cd-1,
charles river) were aseptically removed immediately following
decapitation. a single litter of mouse pups (~10) was used for each
experiment. isolated hearts were pooled, minced and digested at
room temperature with trypsin. when the digestion was complete,
cells were centrifuged, plated at low density (2 w 105 cells ml_1) and

incubated at 37 °c in a humidified atmosphere of 95 % o2–5 % co2.
adult guinea-pigs were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbital by
peritoneal injection. ventricular myocytes were isolated using
langendorff perfusion and collagenase digestion (hoppe et al. 1999),
and similarly cultured at 37 °c.
molecular biology and virus preparation
the human  xxxg1268xxx  gene (provided by dr mark keating, university
of utah) was subcloned into the vector padegi (johns et al. 1999) to
make padegi– xxxg1268xxx . human mink was first amplified from
purified genomic dna by pcr and then subcloned into
padegi– xxxg1268xxx  making a fusion gene with mink at the 5ﬁ end
and enhanced green fluorescent protein (egfp, clontech, palo alto,
ca, usa) at the 3ﬁ end, creating pademgi– xxxg1268xxx . when
expressed in cho-k1 cells, this tandem construct directed expression
of currents similar to those produced by coexpressing mink and
 xxxg1268xxx  from separate constructs (data not shown). the point
mutation g306r was introduced by pcr with overlapping mutagenic
primers. the product pademgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r was sequenced to
confirm that the desired mutation was present. the mgi– xxxg1268xxx 
and mgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r sequences were then spliced into
padrgi, which carries the rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat
promoter, to create the final constructs padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx  and
padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r. adenovirus vectors were generated by
cre-lox recombination of purified p5 viral dna and shuttle vector
dna as previously described (hardy et al. 1997). the recombinant
products were plaque purified, yielding concentrations of the order
of 1010 plaque-forming units (pfu) ml_1.
cardiomyocytes were infected by adding purified viruses to the cells
at a final concentration of 10 000 particles ml_1. for transfection of
hek 293 cells (human embryonic kidney cell line), the lipofectamine
plus transfection kit (gibco-brl, gaithersburg, md, usa) was used.
dna encoding the channel (0.5 µg per well of 6-well plates) was
added to the cells with lipofectamine. transfected or virally infected
cells were incubated at 37 °c.

electrophysiology
electrical recordings were performed using the whole-cell patchclamp or perforated-patch technique (hamill et al. 1981; rae et al.
1991) with an integrating amplifier. pipettes had tip resistances of
1–3 momega when filled with an internal solution containing (mm): kcl,
140; atp (magnesium salt), 4; egta, 5; mgcl2, 1; and hepes, 10; ph
7.4. the external bath solution was composed of (mm): n-methyl-dglucamine, 140; kcl, 5.4; glucose, 10; mgcl2, 1; cacl2, 0.1; cdcl2, 0.5;
 xxxd1804xxx , 5; and hepes, 10; ph 7.4. clofilium,  xxxd2343xxx ,
e-4031,  xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd2388xxx  ( xxxd2388xxx ) were added
to the bath as noted. perforated-patch recordings were performed by
including 100 µm  xxxd164xxx  in the pipette solution (rae et al.
1991). all recordings were performed at room temperature (~23 °c)
after 12–36 h in culture for uninfected cells and 60–72 h for virally
infected or transfected cells. only successfully infected or transfected
cells, as identified by their green fluorescence using epifluorescence
microscopy, were selected for experiments. drug block was assessed
from currents elicited at +70 mv (8 s) from a holding potential of
_40 mv. data reported are means ± s.e.m. with p < 0.05 indicating
statistical significance.

results
properties of iks in neonatal mouse myocytes
when neonatal mouse ventricular myocytes were
depolarized, > 60 % of the cells displayed a timedependent outward current typical of iks. rapid rundown of iks was observed when using the conventional
patch-clamp technique (fig. 1a and c), as previously

j. physiol. 533.1

 xxxg1268xxx -g306r suppresses iks in cardiomyocytes

reported (nuss et al. 1994). little current (< 0.5 pa pf_1)
remained after complete run-down of iks, suggesting that
the contribution of the rapid component of the delayed
rectifier (ikr) to the total current was minor under our
experimental conditions. in contrast, iks recorded with
the perforated-patch technique (rae et al. 1991) did not
run down (fig. 1b and c). subsequent data presented here
were collected using this technique.
figure 2a shows the current–voltage relationship of iks.
as is characteristic of this current, iks increased with

129

progressive depolarization. current density in these cells
was 8.0 ± 1.6 pa pf _1 (n = 13) at the end of 8 s
depolarizing pulses to +70 mv. we next examined the
pharmacological effects of  xxxd2343xxx , clofilium, e-4031
and  xxxd1742xxx  on iks (fig. 2b). application of 100 µm
clofilium, a delayed-rectifier blocker (arena et al. 1988;
colatsky et al. 1990) inhibited the current to 55.7 ± 5.6 %
(n = 5) of the control level. similarly, application of
1 mm  xxxd2343xxx , a putatively selective blocker of iks
(turgeon et al. 1994), reduced current to 47.6 ± 11.9 %
(n = 5). in contrast, application of 10 µm e-4031, a

benzenesulphonamide agent which blocks ikr selectively
(sanguinetti et al. 1990), failed to inhibit the current
(96.5 ± 3.2 %, n = 3) consistent with the notion that iks
was the predominant component. adrenergic agonists
such as  xxxd1742xxx  and  xxxd2401xxx  ( xxxd2398xxx ) are
known to upregulate iks, but not ikr, by elevating the
level of intracellular camp (varnum et al. 1993). we thus
tested the effect of  xxxd1742xxx  (10 µm) on iks by co-applying
it with  xxxd2388xxx  (100 µm), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor,
which potentiates the camp elevation by  xxxd1742xxx . as
anticipated, application of  xxxd1742xxx  +  xxxd2388xxx  enhanced
the amplitude of iks (130 ± 20 %, n = 2).

viral gene transfer of  xxxg1268xxx -g306r to
cardiomyocytes
since the romano-ward mutation g306r is known to
exert a dominant-negative effect on wt  xxxg1268xxx  channel
activity in a heterologous expression system (wollnik et
al. 1997), overexpression of a construct carrying this
mutation in cardiomyocytes should reduce or eliminate
native iks if  xxxg1268xxx  is indeed the major molecular
component of this cardiac current. to test this hypothesis,
we created the constructs padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx  and
padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r (see methods). figure 3a
shows the experiments that we performed to verify the

figure 3. effects of constructs carrying the dominant-negative mutation g306r
a, bar graphs summarizing the specific inhibitory effects of transfection of padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx - xxxg306xxx  on
 xxxg1268xxx  channels. for each group of channels, current amplitudes were normalized by the mean current
of the same channel type (transfected with 1 w dna) expressed alone. current through  xxxg1268xxx  channels
increased when more padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx  dna was used for transfection but was substantially
suppressed when it was co-expressed with padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r. in contrast, co-expression of
 xxxg1232xxx  channels with  xxxg1268xxx -g306r did not lead to current suppression compared to expression of
 xxxg1232xxx  alone. currents were measured at the end of a 4 s, +70 mv or 1 s, +60 mv pulse from a holding
potential of _40 or _100 mv for  xxxg1268xxx  and  xxxg1232xxx  channels, respectively. b, distribution of raw

efficacy of our dominant-negative construct. while
transfection with 3 times the dna (by mass) of
padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx  in hek 293 cells more than doubled
the current magnitude recorded after 72 h, co-transfection
of padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx  with padrmgi–kvlqt1g306r (dna ratio of 1:2) reduced current by ~60 %
compared to expression of wt  xxxg1268xxx  alone over the
same period. in contrast, co-transfection of a plasmid
encoding the  xxxg1232xxx  channel with padrmgi–kvlqt1g306r (1:2), did not suppress current relative to
expression of  xxxg1232xxx  alone. these observations confirm
both the specificity and the inhibitory effect of
padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r.
since myocytes are generally resistant to conventional
methods of transfection, viral gene transfer techniques
were employed to deliver our genes of interest. from the
plasmids padrmgi– xxxg1268xxx  and padrmgi–kvlqt1g306r, we generated the adenoviruses adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx 
and adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r, respectively (see
methods). as a control, we infected myocytes in parallel
with adrgi, which expresses only gfp. myocytes

131

infected with adrgi displayed iks with a current density
(13.1 ± 3.3 pa pf_1 at +70 mv, n = 8, p > 0.05) and
pharmacology profile similar to those of uninfected cells
(fig. 2). iks measured from adrgi-infected cells was
enhanced by 10 µm  xxxd1742xxx  with 100 µm  xxxd2388xxx  (145 ±
20 %, n = 2), blocked by 100 µm clofilium (48.3 ± 18.8 %,
n = 2) or 1 mm  xxxd2343xxx  (38.8 ± 5.6 %, n = 3) but was
not affected by 10 µm e-4031 (105 ± 3.2 %, n = 2; fig. 2b).
these observations indicate that infection of cells with an
adenovirus reporter construct did not alter the biophysical
or pharmacological properties of native iks.
in contrast to adrgi-infected cells (fig. 3b, open
symbols), iks of adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r-infected cells
(filled squares) was markedly suppressed (2.4 ± 1.1 pa pf_1
at +70 mv, n = 10, p < 0.05). figure 3c shows the
current–voltage relationship of iks measured from
adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r-infected cells. application of
10 µm  xxxd1742xxx  + 100 µm  xxxd2388xxx  substantially increased
the small remaining current (data not shown) but further
pharmacological studies with blockers were not
performed because of the small basal current amplitude.

r. a. li and others

as a further confirmation of the identification of
 xxxg1268xxx  as a critical component of iks, we also infected
isolated adult guinea-pig ventricular myocytes with our
viruses. similar results were obtained. iks density was
reduced from 5.9 ± 1.2 pa pf_1 (n = 9) in control
uninfected cells to 0.1 ± 0.1 pa pf_1 (n = 5) in adrmgi–
 xxxg1268xxx -g306r-infected cells (p < 0.05) when measured
at +60 mv (fig. 4a and b). tail current measurements
from uninfected cells further indicate that the current
recorded was fairly potassium selective (fig. 4c);
although the value of vrev (_68.7 ± 3.1 mv, n = 6) was
somewhat more positive than the predicted k+ equilibrium
potential (ek, _86.9 mv under our conditions), our
findings are consistent with prior reports of vrev for iks in
native cardiomyocytes (sanguinetti & jurkiewicz, 1990).
tail currents were not studied in neonatal cells owing to
the relatively small iks amplitude in these cells, resulting
from their small size (typically 5–40 pf), despite the
sizable iks current density.

discussion
overexpression of dominant-negative constructs in native
cells has been a useful tool to dissect the contributions of
various ion channel genes to excitability and different
native ionic currents (johns et al. 1997; barry et al. 1998).
in the present study, we employed this strategy to
confirm the identity of  xxxg1268xxx  as the major molecular
component of native cardiac iks by introducing a
dominant-negative construct (g306r) into cardiomyocytes
to cripple iks. the specific inhibitory effect of the
construct on  xxxg1268xxx  channels was confirmed by its lack
of effect on other channels. though the exact mechanism
of such a dominant-negative effect on channel activity is
still unknown, it is generally assumed that coassembly of
wt and mutant subunits results in non-functional
heteromeric  xxxg1268xxx  channels. however, since such
stoichiometric combinations are stochastic, some functional
homotetramers that are made up of only wt subunits
also exist, leading to incomplete elimination of iks as
observed in adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r-infected cells.
alternatively, incomplete elimination may result from
competition between expression of the suppressive gene
products and turnover of pre-existing functional channel
proteins. regardless of the underlying mechanism, our
work demonstrates for the first time that ‘poison pill’
 xxxg1268xxx  constructs suppress iks in native myocytes. such
suppression could not be due to dilution of mink since
adrmgi– xxxg1268xxx -g306r coexpresses its own mink
(see methods). our observation is pathophysiologically
relevant to the clinical manifestations of  xxxg1268xxx  syndrome,
since diminished iks would lead to prolongation of the
action potential and the electrocardiographic qt interval,
and subsequently increase the susceptibility of afflicted
individuals to malignant arrhythmias. these data support
the idea that  xxxg1268xxx  is the major molecular component of

j. physiol. 533.1

iks and further establish a dominant-negative mechanism
for this romano-ward mutant. this dominant-negative
approach, applied here in cardiomyocytes via gene
transfer, is generally useful for dissecting the molecular
identity of various native ionic currents.
