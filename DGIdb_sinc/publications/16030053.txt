abstract
background. patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism often require therapy that provides longterm control of  xxxg1885xxx  concentrations
without increasing calcium and phosphorus concentrations.  xxxd1701xxx  modulates the calcium-sensing
receptor on the parathyroid gland to reduce secretion
of  xxxg1885xxx  and lower serum calcium,
phosphorus and calcium–phosphorus product in
haemodialysis patients.
methods. dialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism [ xxxg1885xxx  (pth) level
300 pg/ml] who were enrolled in one of four phase
2 placebo-controlled studies were eligible to enrol in
an open-label extension study in which all patients
received  xxxd1701xxx . for this extension study,  xxxd1701xxx 
was initiated at 30 mg in all patients and the dose was
escalated to a maximum of 180 mg once daily if pth
concentrations were >250 pg/ml. use of concomitant
vitamin d sterols and phosphate binders was not
restricted.
results. the analysis of all patients (n ¼ 59) completing
100 weeks of  xxxd1701xxx  treatment showed long-term
control of pth and calcium–phosphorus product.
approximately 55% achieved a pth concentration
300 pg/ml at the week-100 study visit, and 60% had
at least a 30% reduction in pth from baseline. serum
calcium, phosphorus and the calcium–phosphorus
product did not increase during the study.

therapy remained stable.  xxxd1701xxx  was safe and
generally well tolerated at doses up to 180 mg/day.
conclusions. in this long-term study,  xxxd1701xxx  effectively sustained reductions in pth for up to 3 years
without increasing concentrations of serum calcium,
phosphorus or calcium–phosphorus product.

introduction
secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common complication of chronic kidney disease, is characterized by
increased  xxxg1885xxx  (pth); the most widely
recognized complication of secondary hyperparathyroidism is renal osteodystrophy [1,2]. the accompanying abnormalities in bone metabolism, together with
the abnormal mineral metabolism that result from
secondary hyperparathyroidism, are associated with
poor quality of life, fractures, and increased mortality
[3–7]. current treatment addresses the prevention and
reduction of secondary hyperparathyroidism through
dietary phosphate restriction, administration of
calcium or noncalcium-containing phosphate binders,
phosphate removal by dialysis, maintenance of adequate serum calcium concentrations, and the administration of calcitriol or other vitamin d sterols to
suppress pth. surgical parathyroidectomy may be
required in cases of uncontrolled, severe secondary
hyperparathyroidism. in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis therapy, increased serum phosphorus
concentrations and calcium–phosphorus product are

control of secondary hpt with  xxxd1701xxx  hci

subjects and methods
research patients
the institutional review boards of the participating medical
centres approved the protocol, and all patients gave written
informed consent before any study-related procedures were
conducted. for patients to be eligible for this open-label
extension study, they must have participated in one of four
randomized, placebo-controlled qualifying phase 2 trials.
the inclusion criteria for these qualifying studies were age
18 years, receiving maintenance haemodialysis, plasma
pth concentration 300 pg/ml, serum calcium concentration
8.8 mg/dl but <11.0 mg/dl, calcium–phosphorus product
<70.0 mg2/dl2, haemoglobin concentration >9.0 g/dl or a
haematocrit >27%, and liver transaminases and bilirubin
concentrations no more than twice the upper limit of normal.
additionally, patients were required to be medically stable
with no evidence of an active infectious or malignant process
and no evidence of diseases known to cause hypercalcaemia.
patients were to be receiving a constant dose of vitamin d and
phosphate binders (if prescribed) for at least 21 days and
receiving a stable dialysate calcium concentration for at least
7 days before the ﬁrst day of study drug administration.

fig. 1. patients who completed one of four randomized, placebocontrolled, phase 2 studies were offered enrolment in the open-label
extension study, which had a titration phase and a maintenance
phase.

study design
all patients who completed a qualifying phase 2 study were
offered enrolment into the extension study (figure 1). every
patient who enrolled in the open-label extension study
received  xxxd1701xxx  and the dose was retitrated from an initial
dose of 30 mg, without a washout period. eligible patients
began the open-label extension study the day of their end-ofstudy assessment for the qualifying phase 2 study.
during the initial 12-week dose-titration phase of the
extension study, patients received escalating doses of
 xxxd1701xxx  every 3 weeks from 30 to 100 mg to achieve
plasma pth concentrations 250 pg/ml. during the study,
the protocol was amended to allow higher doses of  xxxd1701xxx 
(up to 180 mg) for patients who did not achieve the
pth target. patients were not eligible for  xxxd1701xxx  dose
increases if their corrected serum calcium concentration was
<8.0 mg/dl or if an adverse event occurred that precluded
a dose increase. the dose of  xxxd1701xxx  was reduced if
the pth concentration was <100 pg/ml. to mimic clinical
practice, no restrictions were imposed on the dose or type of
phosphate-binding drug or vitamin d sterol used.
laboratory data were collected weekly during the titration
phase, every 8 weeks during the ﬁrst year of the maintenance
phase, and every 12 weeks thereafter. investigators could
request additional laboratory tests as needed throughout the
study. all laboratory and pth determinations were performed at a central laboratory (covance laboratory services,
inc, indianapolis, in). plasma pth concentrations were
determined by the central laboratory using a double-antibody
immunoradiometric assay for the intact hormone (nichols
institute diagnostics, san juan capistrano, ca).

study assessments
the primary assessments included evaluation of long-term
treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  on plasma pth, serum calcium,
phosphorus and calcium–phosphorus product, and concomitant therapy with vitamin d and phosphate binders
in subjects who completed all 2 years (100 weeks) of the
extension study. in addition, the same assessments were
analysed for patients who completed 3 years of study that
included 1 year as the  xxxd1701xxx  treatment group of a phase 2
controlled study plus the 2 years of the open-label extension
study. for all analyses, results at weeks 52 and 100 were
compared to the phase 2 qualifying study baseline, before
any patient was treated with  xxxd1701xxx . safety was evaluated
by reports of adverse events.

associated with an increased risk of cardiac, visceral
and vascular calciﬁcations [8,9], and an increased risk
of cardiovascular death [10–14]. unfortunately, these
complications also frequently arise in response to
therapy with vitamin d and/or calcium-based phosphate binders, requiring withholding treatment for
safety considerations. repeated interruptions in therapy lead to inadequate pth control and disease
progression [6,15]. recognition of the complications
of abnormal bone and mineral metabolism has led
to the proposal of new national kidney foundation
kidney disease outcomes quality initiative (nkfk/doqitm) targets for pth (150–300 pg/ml), serum
calcium (8.4–9.5 mg/dl), phosphorus (3.5–5.5 mg/dl)
and calcium–phosphorus product (<55 mg2/dl2) [16].
these targets are difﬁcult to achieve in most patients
receiving dialysis, with an estimated 50% of dialysis
patients not achieving guideline targets for pth
concentrations [1,17]. thus, new therapies are needed
to treat this serious disorder.
 xxxd1701xxx  hcl is a calcimimetic agent that acts as
an allosteric modulator of the  xxxg343xxx 
present on the surface of parathyroid cells. by targeting
the  xxxg343xxx ,  xxxd1701xxx  provides a
new means of regulating pth secretion by amplifying
the receptor’s sensitivity to extracellular calcium and
reducing pth concentrations. results from clinical
trials examining single and multiple doses up to 180 mg
once daily suggest that treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  not
only reduces plasma pth concentrations but also
leads to a concomitant decrease of serum calcium
and phosphorus in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism receiving haemodialysis [9,18–20].
this study was designed to investigate the long-term
use of  xxxd1701xxx  to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients receiving maintenance dialysis.

statistical analysis
all patients who received at least one dose of  xxxd1701xxx  were
evaluated for efﬁcacy and safety. to evaluate the effects of
long-term treatment with  xxxd1701xxx  on the concentration
of plasma pth, three types of analyses were performed
including the number of patients who achieved plasma pth
250 pg/ml (reﬂecting the primary endpoints of the phase 2
studies), the number of patients who achieved plasma pth
300 pg/ml (reﬂecting the recent nkf-k/doqi guidelines
[16]), and the percentage of patients with a 30% reduction
in plasma pth at each measurement time point of the
extension study. the proportion of patients who achieved
each of these pth targets at weeks 52 and 100 was compared
to the proportion at baseline of the qualifying studies using
a mcnemar’s test. baseline laboratory values and patient
characteristics represent data collected during the 30 days
before patients entered each of the four qualifying phase 2
studies. results were expressed as means ± standard error
of the mean (sem) and categorical variables were expressed
as a percentage of all patients in the dataset. percentage
change in pth was compared to the pth level before
enrolment into the qualifying studies using a paired t-test.
the incidence of all adverse events within this extension study
was summarized by body system and preferred terms.

results
patients
a total of 170 patients were enrolled into the open-label
extension study and 59 completed at least 2 years of

the extension study. patients discontinued the study
due to adverse events (17 patients), noncompliance/
administrative decision (16 patients), kidney transplant
(14 patients), withdrawal of consent (13 patients), death
(8 patients), and other causes (12 patients) including
2 patients who underwent a parathyroidectomy. the
remaining 31 patients were not included because they
had not yet reached 100 weeks of treatment. nausea
was the most common adverse event that led to
discontinuation, which occurred in 7 patients. all
other adverse events that led to discontinuation
occurred in no more than one patient. baseline demographics, disease characteristics and laboratory values
for the 59 patients are given in table 1. the patients

in the patients who achieved pth 250 pg/ml
at week 52 and 100, the mean (se) baseline pth was
457 (63) and 477 (58) pg/ml, respectively. in patients
who did not achieve pth 250 pg/ml at week 52 and
100, the mean (se) baseline pth was higher: 693 (83)
and 725 (92) pg/ml, respectively. however, 85% of all
patients, regardless of baseline pth value, achieved a
pth value 250 pg/ml at some point during the study.
there was no difference in the proportion of patients
who experienced a serum calcium <8.4 mg/dl between
those patients who achieved and did not achieve the
pth target at weeks 52 and 100.

3 years. sixteen patients completed 3 years of treatment with  xxxd1701xxx , including 1 year in the  xxxd1701xxx 
treatment group of the phase 2 qualifying double-blind
study and 2 years of the extension study. mean (sem)
plasma pth concentration in these patients was
547 (46) pg/ml at baseline in the qualifying study
and this concentration decreased to a mean (sem) of
446 (64) pg/ml after 1 year in the extension study
(p ¼ 0.321), and to a mean (sem) of 390 (70) pg/ml
after 2 years in the extension study (p ¼ 0.056) (total of
3 years on study; figure 3). fifty-nine percent of these
16 patients completing 3 years of therapy achieved a
pth 300 pg/ml after 2 years in the extension study
and 70% of patients achieved a 30% reduction in
pth concentration from baseline of the qualifying
phase 2 studies.

and ca  p >60 mg2/dl2 was not signiﬁcantly different
from baseline at weeks 52 or 100. approximately
30% of patients had serum calcium >10.2 mg/dl and

patients at weeks 52 and 100, respectively. over the
2 year study duration, 8% of all serum calcium values
measured were <8.4 mg/dl.
achievement of nkf-k/doqi targets
greater than 50% of all patients treated with  xxxd1701xxx 
achieved the nkf-k/doqi target recommended by
the national kidney foundation for pth after 52 and
100 weeks of treatment (table 3) (p<0.001, compared
with baseline). these results are consistent with the
study by moe et al. [21] in which patients were treated
with  xxxd1701xxx  or placebo for 26 weeks. in that study,
56, 49, 46 and 65% of patients given  xxxd1701xxx  achieved
the nkf-k/doqi targets for pth, serum calcium,
phosphorus and cap, compared with 10, 24, 33 and
36%, respectively, for those given placebo.
dose of  xxxd1701xxx 
the median dose for patients who achieved a pth
300 pg/ml was 70 mg at weeks 52 and 100. the median
dose for patients who achieved a pth reduction from
baseline of 30% was 90 and 70 mg at weeks 52 and
100, respectively.
concomitant therapy
neither the proportion of patients receiving vitamin d
sterols or phosphate binders nor the average dose of
vitamin d sterols or phosphate binders signiﬁcantly
changed throughout the extension study. at baseline of

adverse events were mostly mild to moderate in
severity. nausea and vomiting were the most
common adverse events (seen in 34 and 44%, respectively, of patients). nausea and vomiting resolved in
16 of these patients without any intervention, the
dose of  xxxd1701xxx  was reduced in ﬁve patients, and
anti-emetics were administered to 16 of these patients.
no patients were hospitalized during the study because
of nausea or vomiting.

discussion
the results of this long-term study suggest that
 xxxd1701xxx  can effectively maintain reductions in pth
for up to 2 years without increasing concentrations
of serum calcium or phosphorus, increasing ca  p
product, and without any attenuation of effect.
furthermore, therapy in a subset of patients treated
for 3 years showed sustained efﬁcacy and safety. the
continued control of pth over 3 years with  xxxd1701xxx 
in a subgroup suggests that this agent can stabilize
the disease process and prevent disease progression.
fifty-two percent and 59% of patients had a pth
concentration 300 pg/ml at weeks 52 and 100, respectively. this level of pth is associated with relatively
normal bone turnover [22–24], and is consistent with
the nkf-k/doqi guidelines [16]. however, deﬁnitive
evidence of the positive effect of  xxxd1701xxx  treatment
on bone morphology and bone turnover in humans
is not yet published, but positive effects have been
presented in abstract form [25]. it should also be noted
that the measurement of pth in this study was 24 h
after the administration of  xxxd1701xxx , whereas maximum pth suppression occurs after 4–6 hours [26].
thus, our data probably underestimate the number
of patients who achieve pth control. this oscillatory
pattern of pth suppression, which is not seen in
patients treated with vitamin d, may have a stimulatory effect on osteoblast bone formation [27], forming
the basis for the use of intermittent pth as an anabolic

the extension study, 71% of the subjects were receiving
vitamin d sterols. approximately 92% of patients
received vitamin d sterols at some time during the
study. at weeks 52 and 100, 69 and 58% of patients,
respectively, were receiving vitamin d sterols.
the use of phosphate binders (dosage and type)
remained relatively constant during the study. at
baseline of the extension study, 85% of subjects were
receiving phosphate binders. approximately 90% of
subjects received phosphate binders at some time
during the study. at week 52 the mean dose of
calcium-containing phosphate binders was 3.1 tablets
per meal, and at week 100 the mean dose was 2.4 tablets
per meal. the mean sevelamer hcl dose was 5.0 and 5.4

progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism [6].
evidence for these limitations is demonstrated in a
retrospective study comparing the efﬁcacy of calcitriol
and  xxxd2851xxx  in clinical practice over a 3 year period
[33]. after 3 months of treatment in the teng et al. [33]
study, both calcitriol and  xxxd2851xxx  reduced mean
concentration of pth by 30 and 22%, respectively;
however, after just 1 year of treatment, an attenuation
of efﬁcacy was observed (5 and 15% reduction in
pth with calcitriol and  xxxd2851xxx , respectively). in
both treatment groups, concentrations of calcium and
phosphorus increased throughout the study (by 14 and
7% at year 1, respectively, compared with baseline).
in contrast, in the present study,  xxxd1701xxx  lowered
pth concentrations 20% on average [20% (median:
41%) by the end of the second year and 21% (median:
46%) by the end of the third year], which was sustained
over 3 years. ca  p product remained unchanged
despite stable, or even decreased amount of phosphate
binder intake, demonstrating an ability to control pth
without increasing serum calcium and phosphorus
concentrations in patients treated with  xxxd1701xxx . the
latter ﬁndings are of particular interest since increases
in serum phosphorus and ca  p concentrations in
patients with chronic kidney disease are associated
with adverse cardiovascular outcomes and high
mortality rates [7,10–14].
changes in vitamin d sterol and phosphate-binder
therapy were unrestricted in this study, and pth was
checked every 3 months, allowing for assessment of the
long-term control of secondary hyperparathyroidism
by  xxxd1701xxx  in a setting reﬂective of clinical practice.
despite the ﬂexibility permitted, overall the use
of vitamin d sterols remained constant. phosphate
binder therapy also remained relatively constant,
although there was a trend towards decreasing
calcium-containing binder use, and increasing
sevelamer use. although individual dialysis patients
frequently have changes in therapy for secondary
hyperparathyroidism, which was also true in this
study, the use of concomitant therapy in the overall
population remained generally constant. this observation is notable, especially in light of the known
effects of  xxxd1701xxx  to reduce pth, serum calcium,
phosphorus, and ca  p concentrations. the optimal
management strategy has not been determined for
patients who have uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism, but the results from our study suggest that
 xxxd1701xxx  can be used either alone with phosphate
binders or in combination with vitamin d sterols and
phosphate binders to control hyperparathyroidism.
in conclusion,  xxxd1701xxx  provides a speciﬁc therapeutic intervention that effectively lowers concentrations of plasma pth, without increasing the incidence
of hypercalcaemia or hyperphosphataemia, which
currently complicate secondary hyperparathyroidism
and its management. with the release of the nkfk/doqi guidelines for the management of bone and
mineral disease in patients with chronic kidney disease
[16], the advantages of improved control of mineral
metabolism in patients treated with  xxxd1701xxx  offers

therapy for post-menopausal osteoporosis. short-term
data reported in an abstract demonstrated that rats
treated with  xxxd1701xxx  had improved bone strength
by biomechanical testing, the best predictor of reduced
fractures [28].
we attempted to identify characteristics of the
patients who achieved and did not achieve the pth
target of 250 pg/ml at weeks 52 and 100. baseline
pth concentrations were higher in patients who did
not achieve the pth target, compared with those who
did achieve the target; therefore, disease severity at
baseline may be a contributing factor in achieving the
target pth. intuitively, if the baseline pth value is
higher, it is more difﬁcult to lower pth to an absolute
target. pth variability may be a contributing factor
in the overall proportion of patients who achieve the
pth target. the proportion of patients who met the
pth target at any time point during the study was
85%, even if they did not achieve the target pth
at weeks 52 or 100. these results suggest that a
greater proportion of patients may have responded to
 xxxd1701xxx  therapy if efﬁcacy was assessed at more than
two time points. a review of laboratory parameters,
concomitant therapy and doses of  xxxd1701xxx  provided
no additional observations indicating characteristics
that were common among patients who achieved and
did not achieve the pth target.
 xxxd1701xxx  is a type ii calcimimetic, which are
allosteric activators of the  xxxg343xxx .
allosteric activators of the  xxxg343xxx  also
include certain l-amino acids and phenylalkylamine
derivatives. these type ii calcimimetics interact with
the membrane-spanning segments of the calciumsensing receptor and enhance signal transduction,
reducing the threshold for  xxxg343xxx 
activation, thereby reducing pth secretion in the
absence of a change in concentration of extracellular
calcium. activation of the  xxxg343xxx 
not only reduces hormone secretion but also decreases
parathyroid cell proliferation [29]. because  xxxd1701xxx 
is an allosteric activator, and not a receptor agonist,
the receptor is constantly subjected to increases in
serum calcium concentrations and responds by turning
off the secretion of pth; the receptor concentration
and afﬁnity remain unchanged. for these reasons, it is
not surprising that  xxxd1701xxx  has sustained efﬁcacy.
the duration of clinical experience presented in our
study is signiﬁcantly longer than recently published
reports of prospective clinical trials with vitamin d
analogues [22,30–33]. in addition, patients enrolled in
our study had received dialysis for a mean of 6.4 years
and had elevated pth levels despite traditional
therapy, including vitamin d sterols in 92% of
patients and phosphate binders in 90% of patients,
suggesting a considerable attempt to treat hyperparathyroidism in these patients.
conventional therapies of vitamin d may suppress
pth concentrations, but often with a concomitant
increase in serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations. these limitations lead to undertreatment of
the disease, interruptions in therapy, and further

hope that new management strategies using  xxxd1701xxx 
to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism could improve
patient outcomes.
