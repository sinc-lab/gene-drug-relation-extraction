 xxxd1698xxx  (6-[4-(1-cyclohexyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy]- xxxd1818xxx )-quinolinone; opc13013) is a 2-oxo-quinoline derivative with antithrombotic, vasodilator, antimitogenic and cardiotonic properties. the compound is a potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (pde) 3a, the isoform of pde 3 in the cardiovascular system (ic50: 0.2 mm). in addition, there is inhibition of
adenosine uptake, eventually resulting in changes in camp levels, dependent on the type of
adenosine receptors (a1 or a2).  xxxd1698xxx  inhibits platelet aggregation and has considerable
antithrombotic effects in vivo. the compound relaxes vascular smooth muscle and inhibits
mitogenesis and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. in the heart,  xxxd1698xxx  causes positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. most, if not all, of these actions are camp-mediated,
including the modi®cation of camp-controlled gene expression.  xxxd1698xxx  decreases levels of
serum triglycerides and causes some increase in hdl-cholesterol levels. the compound has a
number of additional effects which might contribute to its overall clinical ef®cacy.  xxxd1698xxx 
undergoes intensive and ®nally complete hepatic metabolism via the cytochrome p450 systems.
this might result in some drug interaction, i.e. with erythromycin and omeprazole. the halflife is approximately 10 h, resulting in about 2-fold accumulation of the drug during repeated
administration.

introduction
 xxxd1698xxx  (6-[4-(1-cyclohexyl-1h-tetrazol-5-yl)butoxy] xxxd1818xxx )-quinolinone;  xxxd1698xxx ) (fig. 1) is
an antiplatelet vasodilator agent that has been used for
more than a decade in japan for the treatment of chronic
peripheral arterial occlusive disease.  xxxd1698xxx  is also
approved for this indication by the us food and drug
administration. this article reviews some basic pharmacological actions of  xxxd1698xxx  that might be relevant
for its clinical ef®cacy.

mode of action of  xxxd1698xxx 
 xxxd1698xxx  is a selective and potent inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (pde) 3a (ic50: 0.2 mm), the cardiovascular subtype of pde 3. at therapeutic plasma levels of
about 3±5 mm [1], the compound does not affect other
pdes; however, the local tissue levels of the compound

might be higher than the free concentration in plasma
because of the lipophilicity of the drug. importantly,
there is no relevant effect by  xxxd1698xxx  on pde 1, 2 and 4
at comparable concentrations, and only a minor effect
on pde 5 (ic50: 5±8 mm). pde 3 increases the breakdown
of camp. since both platelets and vascular smooth
muscle cells contain pde 3a, this mechanism appears to
explain the inhibition of platelet function as well as the
vasodilatory effects [2].
more recently, another pharmacological property of
 xxxd1698xxx  has been detected: inhibition of adenosine
uptake. this leads to enhanced adenosine actions via
a1 and a2-receptors. in platelets and vascular cells,
a2-mediated increases in camp enhance the consequences of pde-inhibition, i.e. result in additional
increases in camp. in cardiocytes, carrying the a1receptor subtype, there will be a gi-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase with subsequent reduction
in camp (fig. 2). whether this concept works in vivo,

is currently unknown. according to current knowledge, the actions of  xxxd1698xxx  that are most important
for its clinical ef®cacy involve effects on platelets and
vascular cells.

antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects
 xxxd1698xxx  inhibits platelet aggregation, an effect which
is potentiated by  xxxd124xxx  and probably
mediated in vitro via pde 3 inhibition and subsequent
camp accumulation [3] (fig. 3). interestingly,  xxxd1698xxx 
is also active in shear-stress induced platelet aggregation, whereas aspirin is not. moreover,  xxxd1698xxx 
appears not to prolong bleeding time [4] and bleeding

is also not a signi®cant side-effect [5]. this is in clear
contrast to the conventional antiplatelet agents aspirin
and ticlopidine [5] and suggests a different mode of
action.
the antiplatelet actions of  xxxd1698xxx  might be
enhanced by inhibition of adenosine uptake. liu and
colleagues [6] have shown that  xxxd1698xxx  enhances the
interstitial concentration of adenosine in several in vitro
and in vivo models. in platelets this will result in
stimulation of a2 receptors and further increase in levels
of camp (fig. 2).
in vivo,  xxxd1698xxx  is an effective antithrombotic agent.
it has also been reported to be more effective than
ticlopidine in the prevention of carotid thrombosis after
endothelial injury [7].

vascular cells

fig. 1 chemical structure of  xxxd1698xxx .

 xxxd1698xxx  relaxes vascular smooth muscle and causes
vasodilatation. both, pde-inhibition and possibly inhibition of adenosine uptake, may act in concert.
interestingly,  xxxd1698xxx  also inhibits the cytokineinduced expression of  xxxg357xxx  ( xxxg357xxx ) [8].  xxxg357xxx  plays a signi®cant role in
mediating monocyte recruitment in atherosclerotic
lesions. this effect is also probably due to camp
elevation and might contribute to an anti-in¯ammatory

fig. 2 hypothetical scheme for the mode of action of  xxxd1698xxx .the level of camp determines camp-mediated effects, for example,
activation of second messenger induced kinases such as  xxxg1836xxx  (pka).  xxxd1773xxx  levels are controlled by degradation via
several phosphodiesterases (pde) and biosynthesis via adenylate cyclase (ac). ac-activity in turn is controlled by stimulatory (gs)
and inhibitory (gi) g-proteins. adenosine, either from cellular metabolism or extracellular sources, activates gs via a2-receptors and
gi via a1-receptors. this results in either ampli®cation or inhibition of ac.

action of the compound. a recent study in patients with
noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has shown that
oral treatment with  xxxd1698xxx  for 4 weeks signi®cantly
reduced the concentration of soluble adhesion molecules in the blood, probably indicating a vasoprotective
action [9]. in addition, there was a reduction in serumtriglyceride levels by  xxxd1698xxx  in patients with intermittent claudication together with an increase in treadmill walking time [5]. all these data suggest an
improved clinical situation for patients after treatment
with  xxxd1698xxx .

tion of intima proliferation. interestingly, the tissue
concentration of  xxxd1698xxx  in the carotid artery and
muscle around the carotid artery was considerably
higher than in plasma [11]. this is suggestive of a
signi®cant tissue accumulation of the compound,
probably related to its highly lipophilic nature.
there was also suppression of neointimal formation
in dog grafted veins, which, interestingly, appeared to
be related to inhibition of  xxxg99xxx  forming
enzymes [12]. signi®cant inhibition of intimal proliferation after directional coronary atherectomy was
also obtained in humans [13].

antimitogenic effects
in addition to inhibiting platelet aggregation,  xxxd1698xxx 
also blocks the surface expression of the platelet
®brinogen receptor ( xxxg1202xxx /iiia), as well as alpha-granule
secretion of  xxxg2049xxx  [1].  xxxg2049xxx  is assumed to be
involved in platelet-dependent mitogenesis. this effect
might contribute to inhibition of restenosis. however,
other activities of  xxxd1698xxx  might also be involved. this
includes inhibition of heparin-binding epidermal
growth factor-like growth factor (hb-egf) in macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells [10]. hb-egf
is one of the most potent mitogens for vascular smooth
muscle cells and inhibition of its expression is clearly of
relevance for inhibition of mitogenesis. thus,  xxxd1698xxx 
might act as an antimitogenic agent by several mechanisms: increase in camp and interference with the cell
cycle, and direct interference with several growth
factors.
in the rat carotid injury model, single local
application of  xxxd1698xxx  resulted in a marked inhibi-

heart
actions on the heart of pde 3 inhibitory agents are
most relevant in terms of side-effects. pde 3 inhibitors elevate the camp content in cardiocytes, eventually resulting in inotropic and chronotropic effects,
but possibly also in arrhythmias. fatal arrhythmias
have been described with the use of milrinone,
another inhibitor of pde 3, whereas no such sideeffects are known for  xxxd1698xxx . a possible explanation for this different pharmacological pro®le might
be the inhibition of adenosine uptake by  xxxd1698xxx ,
but not milrinone, in the heart (fig. 4). in vitro,
 xxxd1698xxx  inhibited adenosine uptake into cardiac
myocytes, coronary artery smooth muscle cells and
endothelial cells, with a median effective concentration of 10 mm, whereas milrinone was ineffective [14].
this might result from stimulation of adenosine a1receptors and might counteract the increase of camp
via pde-inhibition (fig. 2).

lipid-modulating effects

pharmacokinetics

 xxxd1698xxx  reduced plasma triglycerides and raised
plasma hdl-cholesterol (table 1). in a placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effects of treatment with
 xxxd1698xxx  100 mg b.d. for 12 weeks on plasma lipids
was evaluated [5]. at baseline and at the end of
treatment, ldl-cholesterol, hdl-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglyceride levels, apo a-1 and apo b were
determined. all study participants discontinued lipidlowering therapy at least 4 weeks before screening, with
the exception of  xxxd3014xxx , which was to be discontinued 6 months before screening. patients were instructed
to maintain stable dietary patterns during the 12-week
study period.
after 12 weeks, as compared with placebo,  xxxd1698xxx 
100 mg b.d. produced a clinically signi®cant reduction
in triglycerides of 0.37 mmol/l (15%) and an increase in
hdl-cholesterol of 0.11 mmol/l (10%). total cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol levels were not signi®cantly
changed from baseline in either group at the end of
treatment. similar results were seen in other controlled
phase iii trials.

the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1698xxx  are the same in
patients with intermittent claudication as in normal
healthy volunteers. the pharmacokinetics at steady
state of  xxxd1698xxx  and its metabolites 3,4-dehydrocilostazol (opc-13015) and 4¢-trans-hydroxy- xxxd1698xxx 
(opc-13213) following administration of  xxxd1698xxx 
100 mg b.d. are shown in table 2 [15]. the half-life is
approximately 10 h, resulting in about 2-fold accumulation of the drug during repeated administration [15].
the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1698xxx  and its metabolites
are not signi®cantly affected by age or gender in healthy
subjects aged 50±80 years [15].
there was no displacement interaction between
 xxxd1698xxx  and its metabolites in an in vitro displacement
study [16]. another study reported that there was
minimal in vitro displacement of  xxxd1698xxx  by omeprazole and it was not considered clinically relevant, and
displacement of protein bound  xxxd1698xxx  did not occur
with either erythromycin or quinidine [17], caution
should be taken as signi®cant increases in dehydrocilastazol, a potent metabolite may occur with coadministration of omeprazole.
there have been no reports of clinically signi®cant
drug interactions between  xxxd1698xxx  and aspirin [18] or
 xxxd319xxx  [19].  xxxd1698xxx  and its metabolites have not
been reported to have a signi®cant effect on warfarin
plasma protein binding, and vice versa [16,20] nor to
affect prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time or ivy bleeding times [21,22].
sixteen healthy nonsmoking male volunteers received
a single oral dose of  xxxd1698xxx  100 mg with and without
pretreatment with and continued administration of a
cytochrome p450 cyp3a4 inhibitor, erythromcyin
500 mg three times daily [23]. coadministration with
erythromycin signi®cantly increased  xxxd1698xxx  cmax and
auc by 47% and 74%, respectively, while producing an

fig. 4 concentration-dependent inhibition of nbti binding
and adenosine uptake by  xxxd1698xxx  but not by milrinone [6].

approximate 50% reduction in unbound  xxxd1698xxx 
clearance, suggesting that cyp3a4 was the most
important hepatic metabolizing enzyme involved with
 xxxd1698xxx  metabolism.
in patients with severe renal impairment [creatinine
clearance 0.3±1.6 l/h (5±25 ml/min)],  xxxd1698xxx  50 mg
administered daily on days 1 and 8, and twice daily on
days 2±7, produced cmax and auc0±12 h-values that
were 29% and 39% lower, respectively, than in healthy
volunteers (p = ns). both the free fraction of  xxxd1698xxx 
and unbound  xxxd1698xxx  clearance were signi®cantly
higher (27% and 58% increases, respectively) in the
group with severe renal disease [24].
the pharmacokinetic pro®le of single dose  xxxd1698xxx 
(100 mg) was investigated in 12 patients with impaired
liver function (10 mild, 2 moderate) and 12 healthy
volunteers. there was no difference in protein binding
between those with hepatic impairment and healthy
individuals (94.6% vs. 95.2%), but patients with hepatic
dysfunction had reduced oral  xxxd1698xxx  clearance and
total urinary metabolites compared with controls.
overall, however, the pharmacokinetics of  xxxd1698xxx 
and its monohydroxy and dehydroxy metabolites were
not substantially different in patients with mild to
moderate hepatic disease from those measured in
healthy individuals [25].

conclusion
 xxxd1698xxx  has a broad spectrum of pharmacological
effects that may work together to improve blood ¯ow in
the lower extremities. the principal pharmacological
effects of  xxxd1698xxx  are antiplatelet/antithrombotic
activity, vasodilatation and improvement in plasma
lipids.
