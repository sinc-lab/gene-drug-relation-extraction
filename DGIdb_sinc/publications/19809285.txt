etomidate targets  xxxg834xxx   xxxd2177xxx  subtype a receptors to regulate synaptic plasticity and memory blockade.  the memory-blocking properties of general anesthetics have recently received considerable attention because of concerns related to intraoperative awareness and postoperative cognitive dysfunction. the goal of this study was to identify the mechanisms by which  xxxd2177xxx  subtype a receptors that contain the  xxxg834xxx  subunit (alpha5gabaars) induce memory-blockade by etomidate and a pharmacologic strategy to reverse this impairment.
