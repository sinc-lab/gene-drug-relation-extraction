this paper reports the creation of au nanoparticles (aunp) that are soluble in aqueous solution over a broad
range of ph and ionic strength values and that are capable of selective uptake by  xxxg807xxx  positive (fr+)
cancer cells. a novel poly(ethylene glycol) (peg) construct with  xxxd2494xxx  and  xxxd2146xxx  coupled on opposite
ends of the polymer chain was synthesized for targeting the aunp to fr+ tumor cells via receptor-mediated
endocytosis. these  xxxd2146xxx -peg- xxxd2494xxx  conjugates were grafted onto 10-nm-diameter au particles in
aqueous solution. the resulting folate-peg-coated nanoparticles do not aggregate over a ph range of from 2 to
12 and at electrolyte concentrations of up to 0.5 m nacl with particle concentrations as high as 1.5 × 1013
particles/ml. transmission electron microscopy was used to document the performance of these coated nanoparticles
in cell culture. selective uptake of folate-peg grafted aunps by kb cells, a fr+ cell line that overexpress the
 xxxg807xxx , was observed. aunp uptake was minimal in cells that (1) do not overexpress the  xxxg807xxx ,
(2) were exposed to aunp lacking the folate-peg conjugate, or (3) were co-incubated with free  xxxd2146xxx  in
large excess relative to the folate-peg grafted aunp. understanding this process is an important step in the
development of methods that use targeted metal nanoparticles for tumor imaging and ablation.

introduction
current anticancer agents suffer from several limitationss
they are typically highly toxic and are often nonspecific in that
they accumulate within normal as well as tumor cells. in many
cases, they also have limited bioavailability due to poor
solubility and limited stability in vivo, leading to short halflives and rapid clearance from the body. an ideal solution to
these problems would be to deliver biologically effective
concentrations of the therapeutic agent(s) to the cancer cells
with high specificity. one approach to this ultimate goal could
be achieved by attaching the agents to the surface of a gold
nanoparticle (aunp)1 that is small enough to be transported
through the circulatory system, is not rapidly cleared from the
body, and is selectively targeted to cancer cells.
aunps are the most chemically stable of metal nanoparticles.
they have been studied as “soluble” gold since the fifth or fourth
century b.c. both for their aesthetic and for their curative
properties. in ancient times, they were used in the manufacture
of ruby glass and in the treatment of a wide range of diseases
(1). the use of aunp in modern biology dates to their
application as immunological staining agents for electron
microscopy (2), wherein the aunp are functionalized by simple
covalent attachment or physisorption of an antibody or enzyme
to the particle surface prior to exposure to tissue sections.
recently, aunps have become the subject of increased
interest in the context of the emerging fields of nanoscience

and nanotechnology due to the ease of synthesizing monolayerprotected aunp. these inorganic-organic constructs typically
have a core-shell morphology consisting of a gold core, as
small as 1-2 nm in diameter, surrounded by a covalently
attached monolayer of organic molecules. the organic shell
passivates the metallic core and imparts steric stabilization to
the nanoparticles, permitting their manipulation as stable organic
compounds. recent reviews provide a compilation of the
methods used to fabricate monolayer-protected aunps and
highlight some of their important applications (3, 4).
aunps must be water-soluble over a wide range of ph values
and electrolyte concentrations to successfully target tumor cells.
they must also resist recognition and subsequent removal by
macrophages associated with the reticuloendothelial system. we
anticipated that water solubility and biocompatibility could be
achieved by coating the au core with a biomedically accepted,
water-soluble polymer such as poly(ethylene glycol) (peg),
since pegylation of proteins (5) and liposomes (6-9) is known
to increase their bioavailability, improve their pharmacokinetics,
and decrease their immunogenicity.
one method of covalently attaching peg chains to aunp is
through the use of a thiol-terminated peg. foos et al. (10) used
this approach to synthesize water-soluble aunp. tshikhudo et
al. (11) also synthesized water-soluble aunp by terminating
the peg chain with an alkanethiol. the use of a short alkane
chain between the au surface and the peg chain is thought to
produce a dense, ordered “brush” morphology on the au surface.
tokumitsu et al. (12) observed a conformational transition when
alkanethiol-terminated peg chains are grafted to a flat au
substrate, consistent with the theoretical predictions of szleifer
(13). the peg chains exist in a so-called “mushroom” regime
at low coverages; however, as the coverage increases, they
undergo a transition to a more extended conformation (i.e., the
“brush” regime) away from the surface. from the standpoint of
producing stable aunps for in vivo use, chemisorption of peg
is preferred over physisorption. it is not clear, however, whether
a more ordered peg layer anchored by alkanethiol adsorption

on gold or a more amorphous monolayer provided by direct
disulfide termination of the peg chain is more desirable for
imparting water solubility and biocompatibility to the au
nanoparticles.
a second method for covalently attaching peg chains to
aunp is by replacing the terminal thiol substituent with a
disulfide moiety. mangenay et al. (14) have shown that
hydrophilic polymers that are end-capped with a disulfide can
be efficiently grafted onto citrate-stabilized aunps in aqueous
solution. this is the method adopted in the present study.
 xxxd2494xxx  was chosen as the grafting agent due to its low
cost, simple coupling chemistry, and ease of handling relative
to thiol-based conjugates.
 xxxd2146xxx  was chosen as the targeting agent. folate is an
essential precursor for the synthesis of nucleic acids and some
amino acids, is not produced endogenously by mammalian cells,
and requires internalization by cells via either receptor-mediated
endocytosis or a carrier-based uptake mechanism (15-17). the
 xxxd2146xxx  receptor (fr)-based mechanism constitutes a particularly useful target for tumor-specific drug delivery because it
is upregulated in many human cancers, including malignancies
of the ovary, brain, kidney, breast, and lung. the fr density
also appears to increase as the stage/grade of the cancer increases
(18). an additional feature of fr that is particularly attractive
for intravenous drug delivery strategies is the fact that fr
generally becomes accessible to the vascular epithelium only
after malignant transformation. this is because fr is selectively
expressed on the apical membrane surface of normal polarized
epithelial cells and is, therefore, protected from fr-directed
therapeutics delivered in the plasma. upon epithelial cell
transformation, however, cell polarity is lost and fr becomes
accessible to targeted drugs in blood circulation (19). the folate
receptor has a high affinity for  xxxd2146xxx  (kd ∼ 0.1 nm), which
results in high uptake by fr+ cells, even at low folate loadings
on the therapeutic agent (17, 19). because of these attractive
characteristics, folate conjugation has become a widely used
strategy for targeting liposomes (20-25), plasmid complexes
(26-33), nanoparticles (34-36), polymer micelles (37), and
other polymer constructs (38) for selective uptake by tumor cells.
the 10 nm aunps chosen for this study were a compromise
between providing a reasonable surface area for attachment of
peg chains while at the same time enabling rapid nanoparticle
penetration into solid tumors based on the enhanced permeation
and retention effect (e.g., epr) (39, 40). the aunps were
purchased as a citrate-stabilized aqueous colloid. two peg
polymers were synthesized for grafting onto aunps, a mpegthioctic acid conjugate (mpeg2000-t) for steric stabilization

and a  xxxd2146xxx -peg- xxxd2494xxx  conjugate (f-peg1500t) that would enable both steric stabilization and tumor cell
targeting. after the aunps were modified with either of these
conjugates, they were monitored for colloidal stability by
absorption spectroscopy. kb cells were then treated with either
the mpeg- xxxd2494xxx -modified aunp (mpeg2000-t:
aunp) or the folate-peg1500- xxxd2494xxx -modified aunp
(f-peg1500-t:aunp) constructs (scheme 1) and their capacity for internalization observed using tem.

grafting of functionalized peg polymers onto aunp. all
glassware was cleaned with aqua regia and rinsed with di water.
citrate-stabilized gold colloid solution (3 ml, used as supplied
at ∼5.7 × 1012 particles/ml) was adjusted to ph 9-11 using
0.5 m naoh. the aunp suspension was then combined with
3 ml of 0.25 mm mpeg2000-t or f-peg1500-t, and the
solution was stirred at 25 °c for 16-18 h. the resulting
suspension was split into two equal volumes and centrifuged
twice at 13,000 rpm for 60 min at 8 °c with decantation of the
supernatant and redispersion of the particles in di water. the
two rinsed samples of aunp were then recombined in 1 ml of
di water.
the uv-vis spectra of the aunp in di water were measured
using a jasco v-550 spectrophotometer operating at a resolution

bioconjugate chem., vol. 17, no. 3, 2006 605

of 1 nm with a 400 nm/min scan rate. the concentration of
nanoparticles in the final suspension was in the range 1.0 ×
1013 to 1.5 × 1013 particles/ml as determined by absorption
spectroscopy.
tem characterization of aunp samples. aunp samples
were prepared for tem analysis by placing a drop of the
colloidal solutions on formvar+c-coated cu tem grids and
air-drying the grid at 25 °c. the samples were viewed with a
philips cm-10 tem using 80 kv accelerating voltage.
cell culture and aunp treatment. kb cells, a human
cancer cell line of nasopharyngeal origin that is known to
overexpress folate receptors, were cultured in folate-deficient
dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (fd-dmem) supplemented
with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine,
and penicillin/streptomycin for 3 weeks to establish a folate
deficiency. the folate-deficient kb cells were then subcultured
in 75 cm2 flasks at 37 °c in a 5% co2 atmosphere. cells were
used during the log phase of growth and discarded after the
sixth passage.
wi-38 cells, a normal embryonic human diploid cell line,
were used as a control. these cells were cultured in fd-dmem
supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm
l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin for 3 weeks. the wi38 cells were subcultured in 75 cm2 flasks at 37 °c in a 5%
co2 atmosphere. cells were used during the log phase of growth
and discarded after the sixth passage.
both the kb and the wi-38 cells were plated at ∼250,000
cells/well in six-well plates and incubated for 48 h. at this point,
100 µl of aunp solution (∼1.5 × 1013 particles/ml; sterilized
by filtration through a 0.22 µm filter) was added to three of the
wells. after a 1 h incubation period, 100 µl of nanoparticle
solution was added to the remaining three wells, and all were
incubated for an additional 1 h before rinsing with fresh media
to remove free aunp before fixation.
tem imaging of aunp uptake by cells. tem imaging
was used to evaluate the cellular uptake of aunp. gold
intensification was used to enhance the observability of the 10
nm aunps followed by osmium fixation to delineate the cell
membranes. gold enhancement, unlike silver intensification, is
not degraded by exposure to osmium tetroxide.
the samples were processed in a pelco model 3450
microwave equipped with variable wattage, a coldspot temperature regulator, and vacuum chamber (ted pella, inc.,
redding, ca). processing times and wattage (p1 ) 233 w, p2
) 345 w) are noted for each step. cells were fixed in 2%
glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (ph 7.4) containing
2 mm mgcl2, 1 mm cacl2, 40 mm nacl (p1: 1 min hold >
40 s on > 3 min hold). samples were then washed with buffer
three times followed by a water wash (p1: 40 s each). cells
were scraped from the wells and pelleted by centrifugation.
samples were incubated for 2 min at 25 °c in goldenhance
kit #2113 (nanoprobes, inc. yaphank, ny) formulated according to kit directions to increase the size of the gold particles.
following a water wash (p1: 40 s), the pellets were post-fixed
in reduced osmium (1% oso4 + 1.5% k4fe(cn)6) for two 40
s cycles at p1). the samples were then enrobed with 1.5%
agarose (sigma type vii) and processed further as tissue blocks.
sample blocks were dehydrated through a graded ethanol
series (p1: 30, 50, 70, 90 and 100%, two cycles each, 40 s per
change), followed by propylene oxide (p1 × 40 s). they were
then infiltrated in propylene oxide (lx-112 resin mix, 3:1, 1:1
for 30 min each followed by overnight in 1:3 mix plus
accelerator on a rotator at 25 °c). blocks were embedded in
lx-112 resin mixture (ladd research industries, williston, vt)
and polymerized at 60°c for 48 h.
ultrathin sections (∼100 nm) were picked up on formvar+c
coated 100 mesh cu grids. the samples were viewed with a

results and discussion
the methods developed for both mpeg-thioctamide (mpeg2000-t) and folate-peg-thioctamide (f-peg1500-t) enable the synthesis of these constructs on the gram scale (figure
1). boc-protection of nh2-peg1500-nh2 was found to be
necessary since initial attempts at the direct synthesis of
monosubstituted peg-thioctamide resulted in inseparable mixtures. boc protection results in a mixture of products that is
easier to separate and produces acceptable yields of mono-boc
protected peg. coupling of this intermediate with nhsthioctate, followed by deprotection and coupling with  xxxd2146xxx 
gives the desired f-peg1500-t in reasonable yield.
initial attempts at grafting the  xxxd2494xxx -functionalized
polymers onto citrate-capped aunp under a wide variety of
conditions and concentrations in aqueous solution proved
unsuccessful. however, it was found that efficient displacement
of citrate by the  xxxd2494xxx  functionalized polymers could be
achieved by adjusting the solution ph to 9-11 with naoh.
uv-vis absorption spectra for the 10-nm-diameter, citratestabilized aunp, with and without a chemisorbed f-peg1500-t coating in deionized h2o, are presented in figure 2.
these spectra have a strong absorption feature at ∼520 nm due
to the characteristic surface plasmon resonance of aunps (3).

the height of this feature is proportional to the concentration
of aunps in solution, while peak position and width are
indicative of the size, size distribution, aggregation, and surface
coating of the particles. figure 2 shows that there is minimal
broadening of the peak and only a small red-shift in the position
of the maximum when the citrate-capped particles are coated
with f-peg1500-t. this is an indication that the aunps are
not aggregated in solution. adding hcl, naoh, or nacl to an
aqueous suspension of the aunp (∼1.5 × 1013 particles/ml)
does not markedly affect the uv-vis spectra (i.e., cause particle
aggregation) over a ph range of 2-12 and an electrolyte
concentration range of 0-0.5 m nacl. aqueous suspensions
of aunp within these ranges of ph and electrolyte concentration
are observed to be stable for up to a year as determined by
their absorption spectra.
figure 3 shows tem micrographs illustrating the diameter
and size distribution of the citrate-capped aunps and f-peg1500-t:aunps. although the nanoparticles aggregate due to
surface tension as the water evaporates during sample preparation, the au cores of the particles do not coalesce and fuse.
analysis of the mean diameter and size distribution of these
two aunp preparations shows that the au cores of the
f-peg1500-t coated particles are similar to those of the
citrate-capped particles. these data indicate that aunp integrity
is unaffected by f-peg1500-t grafting.
of the two known mechanisms of  xxxd2146xxx  transport into
cells, only the receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway enables
the uptake of folate conjugates by mammalian cells (42)
(scheme 2). a series of experiments were undertaken to
determine whether the 10-nm-diameter f-peg1500-t:aunps
are selectively internalized by fr+ tumor cells. the nanoparticles were added to the cell cultures at a particle concentration
of ∼5 × 1011 particles/ml or a loading of ∼6 × 106 aunps/
cell, and the cells were incubated for periods of 1 and 2 h. after
the incubation period, the cells were rinsed with fd-dmem,
chemically fixed, washed, and processed as described in the
experimental section prior to tem analysis.
kb cells were incubated with mpeg-t:aunp as a control
to establish that (1) nontargeted peg-coated aunps are not
internalized and that (2) aunps not taken up by the cells are
eliminated in the washing process. figure 4a shows a typical
micrograph of a kb cell exposed to mpeg-t:aunp. only an
occasional au nanoparticle was observed inside the cells, which

was presumably internalized via nonspecific adsorption to the
cell surface. the number of nanoparticles observed outside the
cell membrane was also extremely small as indicated by the
single aunp imaged in figure 4a. these data support the
expectation that mpeg2000-t-coated particles are not internalized to a significant extent by kb cells. the absence of a specific
binding event between the mpeg2000-t:aunps and the folate
receptor on the surface of these cells prevents their uptake,
enabling their facile removal from the cells by washing.
figure 4b shows a typical micrograph of a kb cell that was

incubated with f-peg-t:aunps. after both 1 and 2 h of
exposure, about 20% of the kb cells were found to contain a
large number of the folate functionalized nanoparticles. the
intracellular distribution of the nanoparticles was similar to that
observed with folate-targeted liposomes (21), i.e., localization
within lysosomes near the nucleus and within endosomes
distributed throughout the endosomal pathway. it should be
noted that gold intensification of aunps enclosed inside the

the particles. however, these cells took them up in large
numbers. it is not clear whether this is related to the metabolic
state of the cells during the initial exposure to the particles or
to other physiological reasons unique to this type of cell.
additional experiments will be done to increase the uptake
efficiency and further develop the responsiveness of the system.

acknowledgment
we would like to acknowledge the use of the life science
microscopy facility and the expertise of chia-ping huang in
preparation of samples for tem. dr. vivechana dixit performed
the aunp coating, spectroscopy, and stability studies. mr. jeroen
van den bossche performed the peg syntheses and the cell
culture experiments. this study was supported by the showalter
trust.

the high magnification inset in figure 4b. this phenomenon
and the random nature of the sectioning process made accurate
estimation of the aunp density within the cells difficult.
however, by taking multiple high magnification images, it was
possible to estimate the particle density in the thin sections.
assuming these thin sections to be 100 nm thick, this analysis
yields an estimated density of 0.25-1.0 × 1015 nanoparticles/
ml of cell volume, which is 2-3 orders of magnitude greater
than the particle density in the growth medium. variations in
the incubation times (e.g., 1, 2, or 12 h) of the cells with
f-peg1500-t:aunp did not appear to affect the number of
particles internalized.
two additional control experiments lend further support for
the uptake of f-peg1500-t:aunp via receptor-mediated
endocytosis. when f-peg1500-t/aunp were incubated with
kb cells in a medium that was augmented with free folate (i.e.,
2 µm  xxxd2146xxx  added to the fd-mem during nanoparticle
incubation with the cells), the kb cells did not internalize the
nanoparticles (see figure 4c). furthermore, it was observed that
wi-38 cells rarely internalized any of the particles when
incubated with f-peg1500-t:aunp (see figure 4d). since
the wi-38 cells lack the  xxxg807xxx , they are incapable of
internalizing significant amounts of the folate-functionalized
nanoparticles.

conclusions
poly(ethylene glycol) conjugates bearing either methoxy and
 xxxd2494xxx  or  xxxd2146xxx  and  xxxd2494xxx  substituents at
opposing ends of the polymer have been synthesized. these
conjugates have been grafted onto 10-nm-diameter au nanoparticles, via the  xxxd2494xxx  moiety. the peg-folate-coated
nanoparticles are soluble in water over a ph range of 2-12
and electrolyte concentration range of 0-0.5 m and exhibit
selective uptake by a  xxxg807xxx  positive (fr+) cell line
when the aunp construct contains  xxxd2146xxx . these sterically
stabilized nanoparticles may have potential uses in targeted drug
delivery to fr+ cancer cells.
it is interesting to note that only about 20% of the kb cancer
cells exposed to the f-peg1500-t/aunp actively took up
