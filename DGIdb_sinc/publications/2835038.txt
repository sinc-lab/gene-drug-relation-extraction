summary.
 xxxd3220xxx  and ureastibamine, two potent
antileishmanial drugs~specifically inhibit the relaxation of
supercoiled plasmid pbr322 catalyzed by  xxxg2310xxx  of
leishmania donovani.
dose dependent inhibition suggests that
the drugs interact with the enzyme rather than the dna.
the
inhibition reported here concerning a  xxxg2310xxx 
demonstrates at least one possible mode of action of these
antileishmanial drugs.

methods : l. donovani strain ur6 (mhom/in/1978/ur6) promastigotes were grown in ray's m o d i f i e d media (12) and subcultured
at 72h intervals.
 xxxg2310xxx  was purified from nuclei of l.
donovani.
detailed purification procedure and the characterization of the e n z y m e has been c o m m u n i c a t e d for publication.
briefly, the m e t h o d is as follows.
nuclei were lysed in a
buffer containing im naci, 50 mm trishcl ph 7.5, i0 mm ~ - m e r captoethanol and 1 mm phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (pmsf).
nucleic acids were precipitated by 6% p o l y e t h y l e n e glycol-6000,
1 m naci.
the supernatant obtained after c e n t r i f u g a t i o n of
the extract at 12000 g for 60 min was subjected to chromatography on hydroxylapatite column.
pooled active fractions containing type i topoisomerase after d i a l y s i n g a g a i n s t 50 mm trishcl ph 7.5, 5 mm ~ - m e r c a p t o e t h a n o l , 0.5 mm dithiothreitol(dtt)
0.i mm pmsf, i00 mm k c i and 25% glycerol was loaded on to a
phosphocellulose column and eluted in a stepwise m a n n e r with
kci.
type i t o p o i s o m e r a s e activity eluting between 0.6 m and
0.8 m kci was stabilized by adding bovine  xxxg124xxx  (bsa)
to i00 pg/ml.
for longterm storage the p u r i f i e d enzyme can be
dialyzed against a conservation buffer (50 mm trishcl ph 7.5,
50 m m kci, 5 m m ~ - m e r c a p t o e t h a n o l , 0.5 mm dtt, 0.i mm edta and
50% glycerol) and stored at -209c.
specific activity of the
enzyme preparation was about i0 ° units/mg protein.
one unit
of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme needed
for 50% relaxation of supercoiled pbr322 under the condition
of the assays.
relaxation activity was assayed in 25 ~ i samples.
the reaction mixture containing 25 mm trishcl ph 7.5, 5% glycerol,
50 mm kci, 0.5 mm dtt, i0 m m ~gclg, 30 ~ g / m l bsa and 0.i ~ g
of pbr322 was incubated at 37vc f~r 30 mln.
relaxations were
m o n i t o r e d in 1% agorose gel as described (13).
to study the
effect of dna intercalating drugs electrophoresis was p e r f o r m e d
in 50 mm trisphosphate containing 1 mm edta and 18 ~m  xxxd1674xxx  (9).
plasmid ~br322 was purified by a conventional m e t h o d (14)
and kdna according to the m e t h o d described by das gupta et al
