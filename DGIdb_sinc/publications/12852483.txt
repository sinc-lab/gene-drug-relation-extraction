relationship between cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 selective inhibitors and fetal development when administered to rats and rabbits during the sensitive p...  a review of the scientific literature suggested the occurrence of low-level incidences of ventricular septal defect (vsd) and midline defect (md) in rat fetuses and diaphragmatic hernia (dh), vsd, and md in rabbit fetuses after maternal exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids). aspirin, an nsaid that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase 1 (cox-1) and cox-2, induces dh, vsd, and md when administered as one dose during the sensitive periods of development in rats. unlike aspirin, other nsaids, including selective cox-2 inhibitors, reversibly inhibit cox activity. to evaluate whether the dysmorphogenesis observed after maternal nsaid exposure correlates with cox-1 or cox-2 inhibition, a series of compounds with different capacities to inhibit cox-1 and cox-2 were administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during the sensitive period for heart development and midline closure.
