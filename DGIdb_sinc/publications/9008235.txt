data from the literature indicate that nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), such as indo-
 xxxd2817xxx , naproxen,  xxxd2969xxx , or ibuprofen, induce
hair loss in vivo. these nsaids are well-known inhib-
itors of both the cytoprotective isoform of prosta-
glandin endoperoxide synthase-1 ( xxxg1883xxx ) and of the
inducible form ( xxxg1884xxx ). by immunohistochemical
staining, we found that  xxxg1883xxx  is the main isoform
present in the dermal papilla from normal human
hair follicle (either amagen or catagen), whereas
 xxxg1884xxx  was only faintly and exclusively expressed in
anagen dermal papilla. thus,  xxxg1883xxx  might be the
primary target of the hair growth-inhibitory effects
of nsaids. we thus speculated that activation of
 xxxg1883xxx  might be a mechanism by which minoxidil

inoxidil is a pyrimidine derivative (2,4-diamino-
6-piperidinopyrimidine-3-oxyde) initially de-
veloped as a potent antihypertensive agent
(dargie et al, 1977, devine et al, 1977). in
addition to being a direct-acting vasodilator, it
was unexpectedly found to stimulate hair growth in vive (weiss ef
al, 1984). this major side effect in hypertensive treatment led to its
clinical use for the treatment of common baldness (androgenetic
alopecia) and alopecia areata. minoxidil was later reported to
stimulate a time-dependent increase in °|h]-thymidine and is|-
cysteine incorporation in mouse vibrissa follicles in organ culture in
vitro (buhl et al, 1989). although it has been recently suggested that
both anti-hypertensive and hair-regrowth effects were due to the
action of its sulfated metabolite (minoxidils) on k‘ channels
(meisheri ef al, 1991; buhl ef al, 1992a), no unifying concept
explains by which biochemical mechanisin(s) minoxidil can exhibit
its pleiotropic effects. for example, minoxidil has also been re-
ported to inhibit lysyl hydroxylase in vitro in human dermal
fibroblasts (murad ef al, 1992) as well as in fibroblasts from the
external connective tissue sheath of human hair follicles (mahé ef al,
1996). the exact way by which it stimulates hair growth in vivo is
still a matter of debate.
other drugs are known to interfere with the hair cycle. some

(2,4-diamino-6-piperidinopyrimidine-3-oxyde) stim-
ulates hair growth in vivo. we demonstrate here that
minoxidil is a potent activator of purified  xxxg1883xxx 
(ac50 = 80 um), as assayed by oxygen consumption
and pge, production. this activation was also evi-
denced by increased pge, production by balb/c 3t3
fibroblasts and by human dermal papilla fibroblasts in
culture. our findings suggest that minoxidil and its
derivatives may have a cytoprotective activity in vivo
and that more potent second-generation hair growth-
promoting drugs might be designed, based on this
mechanism. key words: minoxidil/prostaglandin synthase/

(e.g., antineoplastic agents, such as doxorubicin) induce an abrupt
cessation of mitotic activity. others such as b-blockers, interferons,
or retinoids (pillans and wood, 1995) precipitate a premature
resting phase (telogen effluvium). similarly, anti-inflammatory
agents such as indomethacin, naproxen,  xxxd2969xxx , or ibuprofen
provoke hair loss (tosti ef al, 1994; pillans and wood, 1995; for
reviews). because these compounds inhibit the prostaglandin en-
doperoxide synthases ( xxxg1883xxx , e.c. 1.14.99.1, and  xxxg1884xxx ,
e.c.1.14.99.2), which catalyze the first two steps of the arachidonic
acid cascade (smith and marnett, 1991), it is possible that at least
one of these isoforms is active in hair growth. minoxidil has also
been reported to affect the metabolism of  xxxd208xxx  by
inhibiting  xxxg1880xxx  in bovine aorta endothelial cells
(kvedar ef al, 1988) or increasing  xxxd1903xxx , (pge,) produc-
tion by dermal papilla fibroblasts in culture in vitro (lachgar er al,
1996). we thus investigated whether  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  iso-
forms were expressed in human hair follicles and whether minoxidil
was a modulator of these two key enzymes of the  xxxd208xxx 
cascade that is involved in the generation of prostaglandins,

(stored at 4°c protected from light). l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin,
and 199 medium were supplied by gibco (cergy pontoise, france).

biologic materials ovine prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-1
( xxxg1883xxx ) (e.c. 1.14.99.1) isolated from sheep seminal vesicles, was
purchased from cayman chemical co. human scalp biopsies were obtained
from female face-lifting surgery with patients’ consent. they were cut into
small pieces under a microscope, each piece containing about six intact
follicles. tissue samples were then coated in tissue-tek o.c.t. from miles
inc. (elkhart, in), quick frozen over dry ice (— 80°c), and stored at — 80°c.

immunohistochemistry longitudinal sections (5 jzm) of hair follicles
were obtained with a cryostat hm 500 m (microm, francheville, france)
set at —40°c. sections were air dried and stored at +4°c overnight before
processing. sections were then fixed in acetone at ~20°c for 10 min
followed by several washes in phosphate-buffered saline. endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched by immersing the slides in 0.1% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 min. to block nonspecific binding sites and minimize
background, the sections were then covered with 1% nonfat milk-phos-
phate-buffered saline for 15 min. the following primary antibody dilutions
in phosphate buffered saline containing 10% of goat normal serum were
applied to the sections for 18 h at +4°c: the mouse igg, from the cyo-1
hybridoma cell line anti- xxxg1883xxx  monoclonal antibody (moab) pg21
(oxford biomedical research, oxford, mi), which was developed against
ovine  xxxg1883xxx  and reacts with human  xxxg1883xxx  (dewitt et al, 1982), was
diluted to 1:8. the mouse igg, (clone 33) anti- xxxg1884xxx  moab c22420
(transduction laboratories, lexington, ky) was diluted to 1:25. biotinyl-
ated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins (dako, trappes, france) were
applied for 30 min at room temperature. strepavidin biotin peroxidase
complex was prepared as indicated by the manufacturer; sections were
covered with the strepavidin biotin peroxidase complex solution for 30 min
at room temperature. substrate solution (aec, sigma, st. quentin falla-
vier, france) was prepared and applied for 6 min as indicated, and the color
reaction was then stopped by washing with double distilled water. the
slides were finally mounted with cover glasses using glycerol gelatin (sigma)
before observation under a light microscope. because we found no staining
of any compartment of the catagen hair follicle (see results) with the mouse
igg1 (clone 33) anti- xxxg1884xxx  moab c22420) as the primary antibody, this
antibody served as a negative control showing that the biotinylated goat
anti-mouse immunoglobulins were not responsible for the staining we
observed using anti- xxxg1883xxx  moab. additional negative controls were
performed by replacing the primary antibody with phosphate-buffered
saline; they gave the expected negative results (data not shown).

cyclooxygenase activity assay cyclooxygenase activity was mea-
sured at 37°c by monitoring oxygen consumption in a 500-pl incubation
cell connected to a clark electrode (dw1 electrode unit and cb1.d
oxygen control box, hansatech instruments, norfolk, uk). for measure-
ment of oxygen consumption in the presence of minoxidil, the oxygraph
cell chamber was filled with 424 pl of 0.1 m tris-hci buffer (ph 8.00)
containing 5 mm edta and various concentrations of minoxidil (0 m-
425 um). then 100 nm of  xxxg1883xxx  (from a stock solution, 0.235 mg of
82,000 units mg/ml) without phenol and exogenous hemin was added and
after 1 min of incubation, the reaction was started by the addition of 10 jl
of 6.7 mm potassium  xxxd208xxx  (final concentration, 150 w#m). the
oxygen consumption was calculated with the assumption that at 37°c, 260
pm of o, was dissolved as described (nastainczyk et al, 1984).

high pressure-liquid chromatography/enzymatic immunoassay
(eia) analysis three individual and distinct experimental reactions
between  xxxg1883xxx  (170 1m), minoxidil (500 4m), and  xxxd208xxx  (150
am) in a total volume of 500 jl were monitored for oxygen consumption
at 37°c. samples (50 yl) were then taken after completion of the reaction
(as evidenced by the absence of oxygen uptake), kept for 30 min at room
temperature, and then stored at —80°c. it was shown that pgh),, which is
unstable under these conditions, formed stable compounds (respectively
pge, and 15 hydroperoxy-pge,) by nonenzymatic decomposition. the
yield of this spontaneous decomposition was about 90%, with 10% of pgh,
being converted to pgd, (eling et al, 1991). to measure pge, formation
and avoid any interference with  xxxd208xxx  in the eia system, we
performed an extraction prior to hplc purification based on a method
developed by kelly ef al (1989). briefly, each sample was acidified with 20
jul of glacial acetic acid and centrifuged at 2500 x ¢ for 5 min. supernatant
was removed and applied to a 100-mg cy, bakerbond column (amersham,
les ulis, france). the column was then washed with 1 vol of distilled water
and 1 vol of hexane. prostaglandins were eluted with two-column volumes
of ethyl acetate. each fraction was evaporated under nitrogen, and the dry
residues were dissolved in 500 ul of methanol.

hplc the hplc system (600s controller, 616 pump, 996 photodiode
array detector, and millenium software) was from waters associates
(milford, ma). each fraction containing pge, was collected after hplc
separation using a waters nova-pak c,, 4-pm (3.9 x 150 mm) column
(waters associates), the mobile phase was methanol/water/ trifluoroacetic
acid (70:30:0.1) for the first 4 min, followed by a linear gradient of
methanol/trifluoroacetic acid (100:0.1), which was maintained for 10 min at
a flow rate of 1 ml/min. under these conditions, pge, and  xxxd208xxx 
standards were detected at an elution time of 2.9 min and 11.4 min
respectively. because pge, generated in vitro was below the hplc detec.
tion level, the undetectable pge, sample fractions were thus collected at 2,9
min and evaporated using a vacuum device from heto (allerod, denmark),
the dry residues were dissolved in 100 jl of eia buffer, and their pge,
content was assayed using a more sensitive eia system biotrak from
amersham international (buckinghamshire, england).

cell culture fresh samples of human scalp skin were rapidly dissected as
previously described (philpott et al, 1990) under a stereo dissecting micro.
scope using a scalpel blade and watchmaker’s forceps. individual isolated
follicle units were placed in 100-mm culture dishes (corning glass works
corning, ny). dermal papillae were microdissected as described (messen-
ger, 1984) and cultured in medium 199 containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 1%
of an antibiotic/antimycotic solution, and 10% fetal bovine serum (gibcq)
at 37°c, 5% co,. at the time of the first passage the dermal papilla
fibroblasts were seeded in 24-well plates from costar (cambridge, ma) at
a plating density of 5 < 10° cells/cm*. the cells were cultured for 16 h in
10% fetal calf serum-supplemented medium 199. next, 100 4m minoxidil
was added to the culture medium, and the cells were further incubated 16
at 37°c. minoxidil was dissolved in (20:80) ethanol/water, the final
concentration of ethanol being <1%. pge, amounts were directly estimated
using a biotrak pge, eia system (amersham international, buckingham~
shire, england), balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts (clone a31) were obtained from
american type culture collection (atcc, rockville, md). cells were
seeded into 24-well plates at a plating density of 10° cells/cm’. the cells
were cultured for 16 h in 10% fetal calf serum-supplemented medium 199.
minoxidil (100 ,1m) was added to the culture medium and pge, production
measured under the same conditions as we used for dermal papilla

fibroblasts.

localization of  xxxg1883xxx  and  xxxg1884xxx  isoforms in human
hair follicles using specific moabs, we first determined which
pgh-cs isoforms were expressed in the human hair follicle and in
which hair follicle compartment. as shown in fig 1, we observed
that  xxxg1883xxx  was produced in the lower part of the hair follicle.
 xxxg1883xxx  protein was strongly (and preferentially) expressed in the
dermal papilla cells during anagen (fig 1a) and late catagen phase
(fig 1b), suggesting that  xxxg1883xxx  is present in these cells through-
out the hair cycle. in contrast, labeling with moab against  xxxg1884xxx 
showed very weak staining of anagen dermal papilla cells (fig 1c)
and no staining of late catagen dermal papilla cells (fig 14). in
addition, strong expression of  xxxg1883xxx  was detected in the perifol-
licular epidermis (fig 1e) in the absence of expression of  xxxg1884xxx 
(fig 1f). these results indicate that  xxxg1883xxx  is the main isoform
expressed in the hair follicle and in the perifollicular epidermis and
additionally they show that its location is restricted to the dermal
papilla during the human hair cycle.

concentration-dependent enzymatic activation of
 xxxg1883xxx  by minoxidil in vitro because  xxxg1883xxx  is the major
isoform in human hair follicle, and taking into account that based
on 91% protein sequence homology of human and sheep  xxxg1883xxx 
(smith and marnett, 1991) and that sheep  xxxg1883xxx  is widely used
as model for human  xxxg1883xxx  in mechanistic studies, we investi-
gated the sensitivity of sheep  xxxg1883xxx  to minoxidil. as shown in
fig 2,  xxxg1883xxx  is strongly activated by minoxidil. the activation of
 xxxg1883xxx  by minoxidil is evidenced both by an increase in the slope,
indicating an acceleration of the catalytic process, as well as by an
increase of the total o, consumption compared with the control,
( xxxd208xxx  alone). moreover, as shown in table i, this
activation is concentration-dependent, and the ac50 for  xxxg1883xxx 
activation was 80 44m. as expected, the pghs inhibitor indometh-
acin completely inhibited the  xxxg1883xxx  activity (table i). the

stimulation conditions (see table i and table i) indicate that the
oxygen uptake in response to minoxidil can be increased up to
2-fold compared with the control. furthermore, a similar increase
(x1.53) in the amount of pge, was generated in vitro by the
purified  xxxg1883xxx  in response to minoxidil (sce table td).

induction of pge, minoxidil production in the supernatant
of dermal papilla cells and balb/c 313 fibroblasts in
culture in vitro to ascertain that the  xxxg1883xxx  activation by
minoxidil demonstrated at the enzymatic level was biologically
significant, the production of pge, by living dermal papilla cells
and balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts was also measured in response to
minoxidil. fig 3 shows that 100 um minoxidil induced production
of pge, in the supernatant of human dermal papilla fibroblasts (fig
3a) as well as in that of balb/c 3t3 fibroblasts in culture in vitro
(fig 36). pge, production (pg/ml) was significantly increased (p <
9.05, n = 10, unilateral t test), up to 17% by dermal papilla
fibroblasts treated with minoxidil compared without control un-
treated cells (from 75 + 13 co 88 + 20, mean + sd). in balb/c
313 fibroblasts pge, production was also significantly increased
(p< 0.05, n = 4, ¢ test), up to 28% after minoxidil treatment
(from 107 + 2 to 137 * 10, mean + §d). at this concentration
(100 4m), minoxidil had no effect on the proliferation rate of the
treated cells (data not shown). in control experiments, as expected,

discussion

 xxxg1883xxx  exhibits two distinct and complementary enzymatic activ-
ities: a cyclooxygenase activity that transforms  xxxd208xxx  into
pgg, and a peroxidase activity that reduces pgg, to pgh, (smith
and marnett). pgh, is then converted, depending on cells or tissue
type-specific isomerases, to a combination of prostanoids (pge,,
pgd,,  xxxd1902xxx , pgi,, and txa,) that have important and pleio-
tropic biologic effects, usually in an autocrine or paracrine manner
(dewitt, 1991; smith and marnett, 1991).

two pghs isoenzymes have been characterized. the first
isoform ( xxxg1883xxx ), initially purified and cloned from sheep vesic-
ular glands (miyamoto et al, 1976; van der ouderaa et al, 1977), is
a homodimer of 70 kda constitutively expressed in most tissues and
very well conserved among species. complementary dna for
sheep, mouse, and human pghs have been cloned (dewitt and
smith, 1988; merlie ef al, 1988; yokoyama er al, 1988; yokoyama
and tanabe, 1989) and amino acid sequences of the pghs-proteins
deduced. the results showed 88% sequence identity between the
sheep and the mouse enzyme and 91% between the sheep and the
human enzyme. although  xxxg1883xxx  is essential for the homeostasis
of mammalian cells (vane and botting, 1995), the second isoform
 xxxg1884xxx , which presents 60% homology with  xxxg1883xxx , is reported
to be inducible.

pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 and tumor
necrosis factor-a as well as growth factors such as epidermal growth
factor are transcriptional activators of  xxxg1884xxx  (xie ef al, 1992).
consequently,  xxxg1884xxx  is the target of choice for nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs. by contrast, inhibition of the cytoprotec-
tive enzyme  xxxg1883xxx  is detrimental to cytoprotection (as evidenced
by the well-known deleterious effects of the nonselective nonste-
roidal anti-infammatory drugs, aspirin and indomethacin, on gas-
tric cells) (battistini et al, 1994; vane and botting, 1995). despite
being strongly expressed both at the mrna and protein levels in a
control experiment (i-e., dermal papilla (dp) cells in culture in vitro

stimulated with  xxxg1168xxx  50 ng/ml; data not shown),
 xxxg1884xxx  isoform could be only faintly detected in normal anagen
dp cells. this suggests that the  xxxg1883xxx  isoform is the major source
of prostaglandin production in the dp of both anagen and catagen
human hair follicle. recent data on the  xxxg1883xxx  knock-out mouse,
however, support the hypothesis that  xxxg1884xxx  could also contribute
to the basal level of prostaglandin production necessary for normal
homeostasis (langenbach et al, 1995; morham et al, 1995). thus,
because we observed that minoxidil (500 m) could also signifi-
cantly (+160%, p < 0.05, ¢ test, n = 3) activate purified sheep
placental  xxxg1884xxx  (e.c.1.14.99.2) in vitro (data not shown), it is not
totally excluded that in normal anagen, not only  xxxg1883xxx  but also
 xxxg1884xxx  might be the target of minoxidil action. by contrast, the
faint expression of  xxxg1884xxx  observed in anagen dermal papillae was
lost in catagen dp cells. whether this extinction of  xxxg1884xxx  in
catagen dp cells is the cause or a consequence of the transition from
anagen to catagen remains to be established.

during the metabolism of  xxxd208xxx  by the  xxxg1883xxx , many
xenobiotics, such as aromatic amines or phenol, may act either as
co-substrates for the peroxidase activity or may reduce the inter-
mediate iron-oxo species into reduced iron (iii)-pghs, by two
one-electron transfer reactions, leading to the protection (against
“suicide” inactivation) and activation of  xxxg1883xxx  as evidenced by
enhanced oxygen uptake necessary for the cyclo-oxygenation of
 xxxd208xxx  by purified  xxxg1883xxx  in vitro (markey et al, 1987;
eling et al, 1990; mahy et al, 1993). we found that the hair
growth-promoting drug minoxidil, which could be considered as
an aromiatic amine, activated  xxxg1883xxx  activity in vitro. the expected
metabolite of this reaction is prostaglandin h, (pgh,), which
spontaneously decomposes into pge, and 15 hydroperoxy-pge, in
vitro (eling et al, 1991). using a two-step procedure (i.e., hplc
purification followed by eia determination), we measured the
increase (+53%) in pge, synthesis by purified  xxxg1883xxx  as a result
of this enzymatic activation in vitro. a stoichiometric relation

between o, consumption and pge, formation could not be

pgh, into pge, in vitro is not clearly known (eling ef al, 1 991) anq
probably varies under the experimental conditions. the increase in
basal o,, consumption and basal pge, production, however, were
similar (i.e., 2.2 and 1.5, respectively). we further observeg
that the activation of  xxxg1883xxx  by minoxidil in vitro is concentration.
dependent in the micromolar range (ac50 = go hm). this
activation was evidenced both by acceleration of o, consumption
during the reaction of cyclo-oxygenation of  xxxd208xxx  as well
as by an increase in the amount of total o, consumed compared
with a control experiment in the absence of minoxidil.

we found that this activation was not restricted to the dp cells
because murine 3t3 fibroblasts also respond to minoxidil with 4
significant (+ 28%; p < 0.05) increase in pge, production in the
supernatant (from 107 pg/ml to 137 pg/ml). these data are
consistent with observations by others indicating that dp fibroblasts
grown in vitro respond to minoxidil by producing at least pge,
(lachgar ef al, 1996). it is noteworthy that the effects observed in
this study, as well as most of the biologic and chemical effects of
minoxidil reported in vitro, such as inhibition of lysyl hydroxylase
(murad ef al, 1992), inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation
(o’keefe and payne, 1991), and inhibition of  xxxg1880xxx 
(kvedar ef al, 1988), occur at concentrations higher (in the 25-1 000
um range) than those achieved in serum after either topical or oral
administration of the drug (0.02 &~m to 0.7 &m, respectively)
(orfanos, 1990). because an accumulation of minoxidil in the
epithelial matrix cells of hair follicles just above auber’s critical line
(i.e., adjacent to the dermal papilla) has also been described after
topical application (buhl et al, 1992b), this apparent discrepancy
may be related to tissue concentration of the drug in vivo in

proximity to the dermal papilla in which  xxxg1883xxx  activation or
protection might occur.

in humans, olsen and delong (1990) showed no beneficial effect
of the pge, analog viprostol on androgenetic alopecia. the lack of
activity of viprostol in their study might be due to cither an
inadequate frequency of application (twice daily) or a concentration
inadequate to support sustained exposure of dp cells or adjacent
matrix cells to pgs. by contrast, more recent studies (malkinson cf
al, 1993) have shown a cytoprotective effect of pge, against either
radiation- or doxorubicin-induced hair loss i vive (on mouse dorsal
skin) with a maximal activity 2 h after application (and a total loss
of protective activity of pge, 4 h after application). furthermore,
topical application of the pghs inhibitor indomethacin was found
to delay hair growth in vivo in mice.' together, these observations
strongly suggest that the cytoprotective effect of minoxidil that we
describe here should be considered in the complex process by
which minoxidil stimulates hair regrowth in vivo.

we wish to sincerely thank pr. dr. hans schaefer and dr. claude bouillon for their

critical and expert comments on the manuscript.
