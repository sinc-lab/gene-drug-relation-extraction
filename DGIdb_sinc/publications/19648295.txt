duchenne muscular dystrophy is an inherited muscle degeneration disease for which there is still no efficient
treatment. however, compounds active on the disease may already exist among approved drugs but are difficult to identify in the absence of cellular models. we used the caenorhabditis elegans animal model to
screen a collection of 1000 already approved compounds. two of the most active hits obtained were  xxxd2592xxx  and  xxxd1872xxx , carbonic anhydrase inhibitors widely used in human therapy. in c. elegans,
these drugs were shown to interact with cah-4, a putative carbonic anhydrase. the therapeutic efficacy of
these compounds was further validated in long-term experiments on mdx mice, the mouse model of
duchenne muscular dystrophy. mice were treated for 120 days with food containing  xxxd2592xxx  or
 xxxd1872xxx  at two doses each. musculus tibialis anterior and diaphragm muscles were histologically
analyzed and isometric muscle force was measured in m. extensor digitorum longus. both substances
increased the tetanic muscle force in the treated m. extensor digitorum longus muscle group,  xxxd1872xxx  increased the force significantly by 30%, but both drugs failed to increase resistance of muscle fibres to
eccentric contractions. histological analysis revealed a reduction of centrally nucleated fibers in m. tibialis
anterior and diaphragm in the treated groups. these studies further demonstrated that a c. elegans-based
screen coupled with a mouse model validation strategy can lead to the identification of potential pharmacological agents for rare diseases.

introduction
duchenne muscular dystrophy (dmd) is a progressive disorder affecting striated and cardiac muscles. it is caused by
mutations in the dystrophin gene (1,2), one of the largest
gene in the human genome. this gene encodes a large cytoskeletal protein called dystrophin that links the cytoskeleton
to the extracellular matrix (3– 5). dmd is the most prevalent
x-linked recessive neuromuscular disorder, affecting 1 in
3500 male children.

there is still no curative treatment available against dmd.
current treatments for dmd are symptomatic and significantly improve longevity and quality of life but do little to
prevent loss of muscle function (6). the standard care
applied to dmd patients is prednisone therapy (7). several
therapeutic strategies have been developed in the past
decade for which clinical trials have already been initiated:
the reconstitution of dystrophin expression by replacing the
mutated gene using adeno associated virus (aav) vectors
(8), repairing the endogenous gene by antisense-mediated

effect of mtz and dcpm on c. elegans
dystrophin-deficient muscle
we exploited a c. elegans model of dystrophin-dependent
muscle degeneration in a screen of bioactive molecules to
identify potential blockers of muscle degeneration. the relevance of such a screen has been previously demonstrated
(24). during this screen, we observed by visual inspection
that 7-day dys-1(cx18); hlh-1(cc561) adult animals grown on
0.5 mg/ml (2 mm) of mtz or on 0.1 mg/ml (0.3 mm) of
dcpm plates moved better than untreated animals, suggesting
that the function of the body wall muscles in these animals
was partially conserved. examination of the musculature by
phalloidin staining, which labels actin fibers, revealed a dramatic reduction of muscle degeneration in treated animals
(figs 1 and 2). whereas the untreated dystrophic animals
show 5 –6 degenerating or dead muscle cells per pair of quadrants, the animals treated with mtz or dcpm present only
1– 2 such cells.
dose – response experiments (fig. 1) showed that the effect
of mtz and dcpm on muscle degeneration is optimal at
0.5 mg/ml and at 0.1 mg/ml in the medium, respectively
(fig. 1). the positive effect was qualitatively visible down
to 0.1 mg/ml for mtz and down to 0.01 mg/ml for dcpm.
concentration of drugs in the medium above 1 mg/ml of
mtz or 0.5 mg/ml of dcpm was toxic to the animals. the
actual drug concentration in the animal is not known but is
thought to be 100– 1000 lower.
the muscle degeneration in the dmd worm model is
caused by the synergy between dys-1(cx18) and hlh-1(cc561)
mutations, in which the mild hlh-1(cc561) mutation serves
as an amplifier of the dys-1(cx18) phenotype (17). therefore,
we wanted to verify that mtz or dcpm were also active on
the dys-1(cx18) mutation alone. the dose-effect experiments
on dys-1(cx18) showed a decrease in muscle degeneration
similar to that of the double mutant (fig. 1).
the degeneration observed in the dmd worm model is
activity- and time-dependent (17). consequently, compounds
that have a sedative effect or reduce growth rate also reduce
muscle degeneration. to verify that mtz and dcpm did
not act this way, but had a real beneficial effect on muscle,
we tested their impact on these parameters. addition of
0.5 mg/ml of mtz or 0.1 mg/ml of dcpm had no sedative
effect on the locomotion and growth rate of dys-1(cx18) or
wild-type worms compared with untreated animals (fig. 3a
and b). these results demonstrated that the gain obtained
with mtz and dcpm on muscle degeneration is not due to
a sedative effect or to a reduced growth rate.
effect of ca inhibition on c. elegans dystrophin-deficient
muscle
since we found that mtz and dcpm can reduce muscle
degradation in the dystrophic model of c. elegans, we
further investigated the mode of action of these compounds.
sulfonamides are known to be strong inhibitors of human
cas (20). in c. elegans, this class of enzymes is poorly documented. the only documented ca is cah-4 (25,26). consequently, we first inventoried cas in c. elegans. a blast

exon skipping (9), stop codon readthrough, upregulation of
compensating molecules such as utrophin (10), blocking
muscle degradation by myostatin inhibition, anti-inflammatory
therapy, cell-based therapies (11,12). however, efficacy and
safety of those novel therapeutic approaches is still a matter
of debate. consequently, testing small molecules for therapeutic efficacy against dmd is a valuable approach.
since mice have a high unitary cost, random screens of
large numbers of compounds on mouse model may not be
feasible. in addition, there is still no in vitro model that recapitulates enough properties of the disease. invertebrate models
such as caenorhabditis elegans are complementary models to
the mouse because they are cheap, grow rapidly and are amenable to large genetic studies (13 – 15). so, the main purpose of
screens conducted on c. elegans is to serve as a first-pass
filter, in order to select lead compounds out of chemical
libraries, and to eventually test the selected items on the
mdx mouse.
caenorhabditis elegans possesses a dystrophin-like gene
(dys-1) encoding a protein displaying the same structural features as the human dystrophin (16). when in a sensitized hlh-1
genetic background, dys-1 mutations lead to a progressive
impairment of locomotion (17). examination of the musculature of these animals reveals a widespread degeneration of
the body-wall muscles which are responsible for the animal
locomotion. these muscles have a sarcomeric structure and
protein composition closely related to mammalian striated
muscles (18). however, c. elegans striated muscles are different from those of mammals on two aspects: muscle cells do
not fuse, and they are not able to regenerate.
carbonic anhydrases (ca) are a family of metalloenzymes which have various tissue distributions and intracellular locations in mammals (19 – 21). there are several
cytosolic isoforms (ca i—iii, ca vii and ca xiii), five
membrane-bound isozymes (ca iv, ca ix, ca xii, ca
xiv and ca xv), two mitochondrial forms (ca va and
vb), as well as a secreted ca isozyme, ca vi. these
enzymes catalyze the interconversion between carbon
dioxide and the bicarbonate ion. they are thus involved in
crucial physiological processes connected with respiration
and transport of co2/bicarbonate between metabolizing
tissues and lungs. they are also involved in regulation of
ph, co2 homeostasis, electrolyte secretion in a variety of
tissues/organs, biosynthetic reactions, bone resorption, calcification, tumorigenicity and many other physiologic or pathologic processes (22,23). since cas are involved in a large
variety of processes, they represent an important therapeutic
target. disorders including oedema, glaucoma, obesity,
cancer, epilepsy, osteoporosis, periodic paralysis and ataxia
are treated with ca inhibitors (20,21).
a screen of approximately 1000 compounds on the
dys-1(cx18), hlh-1(cc561) model identified several substances
that ameliorated the c. elegans dys-deficient phenotype. two
of the top-five hits turned out to be  xxxd2592xxx  (mtz)
and  xxxd1872xxx  (dcpm). these molecules belong to
the class of sulfonamides, known inhibitors of ca
enzymes. in our study, ca inhibitors were assessed for
their therapeutic potential of dystrophin-deficient muscular
dystrophy in two animal models, c. elegans and the mdx
mouse.

appear as diamond-shaped cells (arrow). dystrophic animals show a high number of degenerating muscles cells (diamond arrows) rarely seen in animal
treated with mtz or dcpm. these animals were grown 7 days at 158c in the presence of drugs, and were observed after fixation and phalloidin– rhodamine
incubation.

from 14 homo sapiens sequences obtained from the ncbi
website revealed six putative cas in the c. elegans genome.
these genes are called cah-1 to 6. a maximum likelihood
tree was constructed (fig. 4). this tree shows that only
cah-1 and cah-2 present a high homology with human ca-x
and xi. the other worm cas are too divergent to be
matched with human cas.
we hypothesized that the effect of mtz and dcpm could
be mimicked by knocking down one or several c. elegans
cah genes. we tested this hypothesis by double-stranded
rna-mediated interference (rnai) feeding experiments.
rnai is a useful method for gene inactivation in c. elegans
(27). four clones available from geneservice bank
(iii- xxxd969xxx , ii-5ln09, x-7m16, x-6i20) allowed targeting of
four of the six cah gene (cah-1, cah-2, cah-3 and cah-4).
the last two clones were constructed for the purpose of this
study. rnai experiments with the six clones showed that
only inhibition of the gene cah-4 significantly reduced
muscle degeneration in the dys-1(cx18), hlh-1(cc561) strain
(fig. 5). rnai experiments ran on gene combinations did
not bring additional information, suggesting that cah-4 is
solely responsible for the drug response to both mtz and
dcpm (data not shown). furthermore, cah-4 rnai did not
impact the activity or growth rate of worms, indicating that
it is the cah-4 reduction per se which is responsible for the

beneficial effect (fig. 3a and b). moreover, this experiment
showed a partial restoration of dys-1, hlh-1 locomotion.
synergy between sulfonamides and ca rnai in c. elegans
to further elucidate the role of these genes in the response of
sulfonamide, we tested for a cooperative effect between the
presence of sulfonamide and the diminution of each cah transcripts. a dose – response experiment was conducted in presence or absence of cah dsrna. no statistical difference was
observed between the dose –response control and the dose –
response coupled with the inhibition of cah-1, cah-2, cah-3,
cah-5 and cah-6 transcripts (fig. 6). the optimal concentration
remains around 0.5 mg/ml in all conditions, and the sublethal
mtz concentration remains also unchanged (1 mg/ml). on the
contrary, the inhibition of cah-4 transcripts in presence of
mtz or dcpm showed a dramatic shift of the dose – response
curve to the left. the mtz is lethal at 1 mg/ml in the medium
for the negative control and this concentration goes down to
0.1 mg/ml when coupled with an inhibition of cah-4 transcripts. the optimal concentration to reduce degeneration
goes down from 0.5 to 0.01 mg/ml when coupled to cah-4
rnai. for dcpm, the toxic concentration is shifted from
0.5 to 0.05 mg/ml when coupled with cah-4 rnai and the
optimal concentration is shifted from 0.1 to 0.005 mg/ml.

we then investigated the tissue expression of cah-4. to localize cah-4, a plasmid carrying the putative endogenous promoter of cah-4 in frame with gfp was constructed and
injected in worms. fifty fluorescent worms (all stages) were
analyzed under confocal microscopy. the gfp protein was
localized at all stages in the excretory cell, in the nervous
system (nerve ring, dorsal and ventral cord and motor
neuron commissures), in body wall muscles and in the anal
muscles (fig. 7). this expression pattern is consistent with
the effect observed.

(15 mg/kg/day) or a high-dose (60 mg/kg/day) was administered, which is, respectively, 5 and 20 human average
posology. for mtz, 20 posology (86 mg/kg/day) was
lethal, so we administered a low concentration which was 1
posology (4.3 mg/kg/day) and a high concentration which was
5 posology (21.5 mg/kg/day). concentrations of drugs in
food were calculated on the basis of that mdx mice eat
15% of their body weight per day (l.s., unpublished
results). all mice had similar weight at the end of the treatment
suggesting that food intake was comparable. two types of
readouts were conducted: histology and force measurement.
histology assessment of mtz treated muscles. muscles from
drug-treated animals were histologically analyzed. representative wheat germ agglutinin (wga-staining), for tibialis
anterior (ta) muscles of mtz high dosage group is shown in
figure 8. we performed haematoxylin eosin staining
(he-staining) to obtain a general impression of the histological
appearance of both groups to be compared. no obvious differences of the histological appearance became visible for 5
mtz treated muscles compared with the untreated group
(data not shown). however, an automated analysis of the fiber
type distribution revealed subtle differences (see below). in
figure 8a and b the alexa 488 conjugated wga-staining for
sections from untreated and 5 mtz treated mdx mice is
shown. the wga-staining allowed clear delineation of fiber
boundaries for determination of minimal fiber diameters.
myosin heavy chain (mhc) double staining (fig. 9a) provided information about the fiber type distribution, mhc isoforms i, and type iia and iib fibers, which are separately
stained by the protocol applied. both substances showed no
effect on the fiber type composition (data not shown).
automated histological analysis of muscle sections. in order to
obtain a reliable and secured statistical analysis of
pathology-relevant histological parameters of dystrophic
muscle in mdx mice, a standardized and automated quantitative method was developed with s.co lifescience
(münchen, germany) (fig. 9). two adequate parameters for
analysis of the histological status were chosen. the minimal
feret’s diameter of the fibers, and the percentage of centrally

nucleated fibers (indicative of muscle regeneration) were
determined (29).
dystrophic muscle typically displays a higher variability of
the muscle fiber diameter compared with wild-type muscle.
the variance coefficient (vc) of all muscle fiber minimal
feret’s diameters of a given muscle cross-section provides a
numerical value of the fiber size variability (29). the
minimal feret’s diameter is very robust against experimental
errors such as the orientation of the sectioning angle. regarding the second histological parameter, muscles of wild-type
mice rarely contain centralized nuclei, whereas muscles of
mdx mice show an average percentage of up to 66% of centrally nucleated fibers after the first crisis of degeneration
and regeneration at around 7 weeks of age.
in this study, we examined about 3000 fibers of ta and diaphragm (dia) muscles for each 5 mtz treatment and
untreated group covering both parameters. automated histological analysis was performed only for the 5 mtz treated
group and its untreated control group, because quality of the
muscles belonging to the dcpm group was not sufficient
and thus analysis not possible.
the histological analysis of the ta muscle showed a significant decrease of the percentage of centrally nucleated fibers in
the 5 mtz treated group (mtz: 57.4 + 14.9; control:
65.1 + 11.2; p ¼ 0.03) (fig. 10a), and a non-significant
higher vc with z ¼ 487 in the treatment group compared
with z ¼ 448 in the control group (p . 0.05). in accordance
with the higher vc in the 5 mtz-treated group, we were
able to distinguish a shift of the minimal feret’s diameter
towards smaller fibers with diameters ,20 mm (fig. 10c) in
the 5 mtz-treated group (p ¼ 0.03), whereas the number
of fibers between 30 and 40 mm were higher in the untreated
group (p ¼ 0.02) (fig. 10c).
in dia no significant change in the percentage of centrally
nucleated fibers between 5 mtz treated group (72.1 + 6.7)
and untreated control group (75.1 + 7.0) was observed (p ¼
0.085) (fig. 10b) and the vc of the muscle fiber size distribution in diaphragm was slightly lower with z ¼ 425 in the
treatment group compared with z ¼ 439 in the untreated
group (p . 0.05). moreover, a very similar fiber size distribution was observed in both groups (fig. 10d).

muscle force measurements of mdx mice treated with mtz
and dcpm. the ability of therapeutic drugs to improve
force generation was determined by isometric force measurement using different protocols able to distinguish between
maximal force generation capability (tetanic force) and resistance to eccentric contraction. treatment of mice with dcpm
(20 posology) increased significantly the tetanic specific
force of extensor digitorum longus (edl) muscle by 30% in
the treated group (dcpm: 282 + 64; untreated: 198 + 53;
p ¼ 0.034) (fig. 11b). this improvement in muscle force generation was not seen in the second treatment group at lower
concentration (data not shown).
we further examined in mdx edl muscle the maximal
force generation using an eccentric contraction protocol with
elongation of the muscle for 10% of its resting length (lo).
treatment with dcpm at both concentrations, however, was
not able to improve this parameter. on the contrary, results
in figure 11a show a significant (p ¼ 0.034) higher percentage of the mean force drop in dcpm treated mice (67 +
14%) compared with untreated mdx mice (46 + 15%). these
results show that dcpm treatment improved the effective
muscle strength, but was not able to increase muscle fiber
resistance to exercise.
the 5 mtz treatment group displayed a non-significant
higher percentage of the mean force drop (55 + 17 versus
49 + 15% in the untreated group) (fig. 11c), whereas
tetanic specific force increased in the 5 mtz treated mice
by 25% (mtz: 264 + 57; untreated: 197 + 86; p ¼ 0.05), as
shown in figure 11d.
overall, with the exception of the eccentric contraction test,
these substances show a clear improvement of the dystrophic
phenotype in mdx mice.

discussion
caenorhabditis elegans as a model for drug discovery
our findings confirm the use of c. elegans as a model organism for screening, identifying and characterizing potential lead
pharmacological agents. in this study, we show the therapeutic

potential of a previously unsuspected class of molecules for
the treatment of dmd. one of the concerns of using the
c. elegans model for drug discovery is the determination of
the effective dose for a lead compound. the molecules used
in this study were provided to the worms through the media.
c. elegans has an outer exoskeleton (cuticle) which provides
protection from environmental chemicals (30). thus, the
effective concentration absorbed through the cuticle and/or
the intestinal lumen is not known and is approximately
100 – 1000 lower than in the medium (28). however, this
limitation does not impede the use of c. elegans. data have
to be considered mostly in a qualitative manner.

sulfonamide and ca in c. elegans
sulfonamide is known to be strong inhibitors of several ca in
humans (20). after identifying cas in the worm, we knocked
down their expression by rnai experiments and we found
that rnai inhibition of cah-4 reduced muscle degeneration
(fig. 4). since cah-4 reduction mimics the effect of sulfonamide treatment, it is likely that it is the target of the compounds (fig. 5). moreover, several sulfonamides including
mtz and dcpm have already been found to be active on
cah-4 with ki values at 42 and 38 nm, respectively (25),
and null mutants cah-4(tm2805) are lethal. we postulated
that this lethality is due to the absence of cah-4 activity
since we could mimic it with a high concentration of mtz
(1 mg/ml) or dcpm (0.5 mg/ml). furthermore, worms
display an increased sensitivity to mtz and dcpm when
these treatments are coupled with cah-4 rnai (fig. 6). all
together, these results suggest that the gain obtained in the
c. elegans dystrophin-deficient model is due to an inhibition
of cah-4 activity by sulfonamide.
furthermore, the cah-4::gfp reporter gene was localized in
body wall muscles and in the nervous system. although it
cannot be formally demonstrated, it is likely that sulfonamides
act directly on muscles for the following reasons: (i) compounds did not reduce locomotion of dys-1 and wild-type
worms, indicating an absence of a major effect on the

the nervous system of c. elegans (31), yet it is of considerable
effect in our experiment.
mtz and dcpm are known to induce metabolic acidosis
and their mechanisms of action most likely involve changes
of ph that alter the transmembrane potential and excitability
(32). lower ph values reduce potassium conductance of the
cell membrane and have an effect on the activation and inactivation of sodium and calcium channels, respectively (33). on

trans-chamber induced a reduction of the unitary conductance
of the ca2þ release channel (34). since we found that calcium
channel activity is a critical factor in the progression of

dystrophin-dependent muscle degeneration in c. elegans
(35), we hypothesize that an appropriate concentration of
mtz or dcpm could reduce ca2þ transients and thus
decrease muscle degeneration in c. elegans.
effect of mtz and dcpm on mdx mouse muscle
despite the fact that muscle pathology for dystrophindeficiency differs between the mdx mouse model and human
patients, the mdx mouse model is the most important animal
model for preclinical studies in dmd research (36,37). in
the present study, we have applied recommended methods
for pre-clinical analysis in dmd research. readout parameters

included muscle force measurement on isolated muscle, and
the histological examination including the percentage of centrally nucleated fibers and the vc of the fiber size which
reflects the degeneration and regeneration processes.
histological analysis of the ta muscle revealed a statistically significant decrease in the percentage of centrally
nucleated fibers for 5 mtz treated mice, implying less
degeneration/regeneration occurring during the treatment
period. this result is particularly remarkable, since the treatment was initiated at an age of 70 days, a time point where
intense degenerative and regenerative activity had already
taken place (38 – 40).
moreover, automated histological analysis revealed an
increase in fiber size variability in the 5 mtz-treatment
group, which is not obvious by simple visual inspection of the
corresponding he sections. a detailed analysis of the fiber
size distribution revealed the occurrence of more smaller and
larger fibers, which typically arise during cycles of regeneration
and degeneration, in this group. in addition neural cell
adhesion molecule (ncam) staining for regenerating fibers
clearly showed more ncam positive fibers, corroborating the
higher number of small fibers observed here (data not shown).
dia presents the most severely affected muscle in mdx mice.
in this study treatment of mdx mice with 5 mtz did not ameliorate the histological parameters of the diaphragm. possibly,
damage associated with dystrophin-deficiency in the diaphragm
is too severe to be alleviated by the treatment applied in this
study. also, the treatment window used here may occur to late
to show any improvement for the diaphragm.
we then investigated the functional analysis of muscle force
measurements of limb muscles. significant differences

between mdx and wild-type mice are easier observed in
older mice (41). in the mtz- and dcpm-high dosage
groups an increase of the tetanic specific force led to an
improvement of the maximal force. the increase in muscle
force was not due to differences in muscle weight or size,
since normalization of isolated muscles regarding to these
two parameters occurred. the maximal force generation, but
not the overall resistance of the muscle to a stimulated endurance protocol, was increased.
a possible mode of action of mtz and dcpm could be
through a reduction of reactive oxygen species, in particular
by blocking the muscle-abundant  xxxg294xxx  (42 – 44). however,
since  xxxg294xxx  is more than 10 000 times less sensitive to mtz
compared with other ca isoforms, this hypothesis is still a
matter for conjecture (26).
wetzel et al. analyzed the effects of ca inhibitors on
muscle force generation and ca2þ-transients. inhibition of a
sarcoplasmatic reticulum ca (sr-ca) isoform was suggested.
indeed, mtz was shown to be a strong inhibitor of the membrane bound  xxxg301xxx  and of the c. elegans cah-4, too, and it was
stated that inhibition of only one sr-ca isoform does not
affect muscle contraction, whereas inhibition of all three
cas iv, ix and xiv does (26,45). thus inhibition of these
ca isoforms could be implicated in the observed phenotypes
in this study as well. treatment of isolated muscle bundles
with one particular inhibitor l-645151 or 6- xxxd2058xxx 
increased the peak force signals of twitches on edl and
soleus and showed a prolonged t1/2 relaxation time. the
authors suggested that cas generate hþ outside the sr and
supply the ions for the coupled ca2þ – hþ bidirectional transport across the sr membrane and buffer incoming hþ ions

materials and methods
strains and culture conditions
caenorhabditis elegans strains were cultured at 158c on 6 cm
petri dishes containing ngm agar and a lawn of escherichia
coli op50 unless stated otherwise. the dys-1(cx18);
hlh-1(cc561) strain was grown at 158c, which is the permissive temperature for the ts mutation hlh-1(cc561) (17). the
wild-type n2 strain was obtained from the caenorhabditis
genetics center.

according to waterston et al. (48). slides were observed on
a zeiss axioplan microscope. a body wall muscle cell is considered degenerating when its actin fibers are fragmented or
destroyed (17) (fig. 1). only the two most visible muscle
quadrants of each animal were scored. numbers were compared by a student’s t-test.
locomotion rate and growth rate
to estimate the locomotion rate of worms, 7-day animals were
scored for the number of body bends generated during an
interval of 1 min. a body bend was defined as one complete
sinusoidal movement from maximum to minimum amplitude
and back again. the growth rate refers to the time from p0
egg to the first f1 egg (generation time). at last 30 worms
were examined.
phylogenetic analyses
to search for ca in c. elegans, a blastp search was performed
on caenorhabditis elegans genome (taxid: 6239) with 14
homo sapiens cas sequences obtained from the ncbi
website as query sequence. ca1 (np_001729.1), ca2
(np_000058.1), ca3 (aah04897.1), ca4 (np_000708.1),
ca5 (np_001730.1),  xxxg298xxx  (eaw71606.1), ca 7
(eaw83046.1), ca8 (np_004047.3), ca9 (np_001207.2),
 xxxg288xxx  (np_064563.1),  xxxg289xxx  (np_001208.2),  xxxg290xxx 
(eaw77648.1),
 xxxg291xxx 
(np_940986.1)
and
 xxxg292xxx 
(np_036245.1). the c. elegans sequences selected are:
cah-1 (np_498083.1), cah-2 (np_495567.3), cah-3
(np_510674.1), cah-4 (np_510265.1), cah-5 (np_509186.3)
and cah-6 (np_491189.1). a maximum likelihood tree was
constructed with seeview version 4.0 (49), based on alignment using muscle (multiple sequence comparison by
log-expectation) (50). the anthopleura elegantissima ca
sequence (af140537_1) was used as an out-group. the bootstrap was performed with 500 replicates.

pharmacological compounds
all pharmacological compounds were obtained from sigma
chemical co. (st. louis, mo, usa). concentrated solutions
of each drug were prepared by dissolving compounds in
dmso. c. elegans tolerates dmso up to a final concentration
of 2% vol/vol. compounds were added to liquid ngm that had
been autoclaved and cooled to 558c, and the media was
immediately mixed and dispensed into petri dishes. c.
elegans are permeable to aqueous and organic molecules,
although the tough, outer cuticle may necessitate high concentrations. it is admitted that drugs penetrate the animals both by
diffusion through the cuticle and ingestion (37). drugs used in
this study were: mtz, dcpm.
muscle observation and analysis on c. elegans
the body wall muscles of c. elegans are divided into four
quadrants (ventral right and left, dorsal right and left) each
of which consists of 23 or 24 trapezoidal cells, arranged in
two staggered rows. muscle observation was performed on
7-day animals, after fixation, by rhodamine coupled-phalloidin
staining, a marker of filamentous actin. staining was done

rnai procedure
rnai experiments was performed on ngm plates supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin, 12.5 mg/ml tetracycline
and 1 mm iptg as previously described (51). the rnai
clones for cah-1, cah-2, cah-3 and cah-4 were obtained from
the geneservice library. rnai for cah-5 and cah-6 were
obtained by amplification of 600 bp of genomic dna of
either gene and cloned into the rnai feeding vectors l4440
(courtesy of dr andrew fire). bacterial suspensions were
used to seed rnai plates. five adult gravid worms were put
on plate for one night and removed, so as the progeny were
exposed to drug and rnai from hatching to fixation. all
animals were fixed and observed at day 7. as a control,
pos-1 rnai knockdown performed in parallel resulted in
near 100% embryonic lethality.

inside the sr by catalysis of the reverse reaction (46). bruns
et al. (47) showed an acceleration of the co2 – hco2
3 reaction
of 1000-fold by the sr-ca. catalysis by  xxxg293xxx  reduced the
half time from 7 s to 7 ms. inhibition of cas by sulfonamides was shown to slow ca2þ release from the sr. consequently, release and uptake of ca2þ as well as the rise time
of twitches (increase in force) were prolonged, providing a
plausible explanation for the increase in maximal tetanic
force by ca inhibitors.
despite a decrease in resistance of muscle fibers to eccentric
contractions, the analyzed substances dcpm and mtz
showed efficacy in the mdx mouse and increased the specific
tetanic muscle force, demonstrating that a c. elegans screen
coupled with a mouse model validation strategy can conduct
to the identification and characterization of potentials drugs
against rare diseases. differences in ca usage and model
physiology likely account for differences of responses
observed between the two models.
at this time, sulfonamide like mtz and dcpm may not be
pursued in further preclinical for treatment of dmd, but the
development of isozyme-specific or at least organ-selective
ca inhibitors may be highly beneficial to improve their efficacy against dmd and applied to other muscular dystrophies,
as well as devoid of major side effects.

injected with 150 ng/ml pceh361 (dpy-5 rescuing construct),
10 ng/ml of promoter-cah-4::gfp fusion pcr product.
plasmid microinjection was performed as described (52). individual f1 wild-types were isolated and we retained a line that
transmitted f2 transgenics. transgenic worms with gfp fluorescence were selected, and the animals were viewed by fluorescence microscopy on a zeiss lsm 510 meta fluorescence
confocal microscope.
mice and treatment

muscle force measurement
after feeding for 120 days musculus extensor digitorum
longus was removed and connected to an isometric force transducer (type gra ft-03; fmi, seeheim, germany) (model
mio-0501 dc-brückenmeßverstärker; alfos ag, bielbenken; fmi, seeheim, germany) coupled to a signal amplifier (model mio-0501 dc-brückenmeßverstärker; fmi,
seeheim, germany). electrical field stimulation was generated
by means of platinum electrodes on both sides of the muscle.
supramaximal stimuli with monophasic pulse duration of 1 ms
were released through a computer-controlled electrical stimulator (model isg-8834/1-s: fmi, seeheim, germany).
maximal isometric twitch force was assessed by three twitch
stimulations. the maximal isometric tetanic force was
measured stimulating the muscle at 125 hz for 175 ms.
specific force was obtained by normalizing maximum
tetanic force on total muscle cross-sectional area (csa).
csa was calculated by following formula (53):
muscle mass[mg]
fiber length[mm]1:06mg/mm :
measurements for eccentric contraction were performed in
principle as described (54).
histochemistry and immunohistochemistry
eight-micrometer serial cross sections of m. tibialis anterior
and diaphragm were stained with haematoxylin – eosin and
sequentially with antibodies against type i myosin heavy
chain and type ii (iia and iib) myosin heavy chain for
mhc-double staining, respectively. he-staining was carried
out according to standard protocols. the antibody against
type i myosin heavy chain (novocastra, newcastle upon
tyne, uk) was diluted 1 : 100 as well as the type ii myosin

heavy chain antibody (novocastra, newcastle upon tyne,
uk). each incubation of the sections with one of the two
primary antibodies was followed by staining with the secondary antibody rabbit anti mouse ig horseradish peroxidise
(dako, glostrop, denmark) diluted 1 : 100. the different
myosin heavy chain fiber types were visualized sequentially
by different substrates 3,30 diaminobenzidine (sigma-aldrich,
steinheim, germany) showing a brown color (type i) and the
substrate provided by the vector sg visualization solution
(vector laboratories, burlinhame, usa) showing a blue
color (type iia and iib). after the first color reaction the sections were blocked with fetal calf serum before the second
primary antibody was applied.
the fiber boundaries were stained by 100 ng/ml wga conjugated to alexa fluor 488 (molecular probes, leiden, netherlands). nuclei were stained with 10 ng/ml dapi (sigma,
steinheim, germany). finally, cover slips were mounted in
dakocytomation fluorescent (dako, glostrop, denmark).
quantitative assessment of muscle histology
automatic quantitative analysis of muscle histology was performed with a special designed module for the image analysis
system s.core by s.co lifescience, munich, germany.
three different images of the observed section were taken in
parallel: (i) green fluorescent wga staining to display the
fiber boundaries, (ii) blue fluorescent dapi staining to show
the nuclei, (iii) mhc-double staining to visualize all fibers
which are positive for type i mhc or type iia and iib mhc,
respectively. in the first image all membrane structures were
subtracted from background, leading to a mask for the individual muscle fibers, and the minimal feret’s diameter calculated.
this mask was superimposed first with the dapi image to
quantify the number of nuclei within each single muscle
fiber and subsequently with the mhc-double staining to determine the fibers positive for type i mhc or type iia and iib
mhc, respectively. the vc was calculated using the following formula:
z ¼ 1000

s.d. of muscle of fiber min  feret’s diameter
:
mean muscle fiber min  feret’s diameter

automated histological analysis was performed only for the
5 mtz treated group and the corresponding control group,
because the quality of the muscles belonging to the dcpm
group was not sufficient for analysis.
statistical analysis
statistical analysis was performed using spss statistics 17.0
software (spss gmbh software, munich, germany). all
data sets were tested for normal distribution using the kolmogorov – smirnov test. those data subsets that showed a normal
distribution were analyzed performing a t-test. all others were
tested with the mann – whitney test.
