melatonin is an indole hormone that is the major secretory
product of the pineal gland. the most clearly defined actions of
melatonin have been demonstrated on the reproductive system
of seasonally breeding animals and on circadian rhythms and
sleep. a rapidly emerging avenue of investigation is the oncostatic and anti-proliferative effects of melatonin on endocrineresponsive neoplasms, especially in those concerning the mammary gland (1). the most common conclusion in animal models
of tumorigenesis is that either experimental manipulations
that activate the pineal gland or the administration of melato* this work was supported by comisión interministerial de ciencia y

nin reduces the incidence and development of chemically induced mammary tumors, whereas pinealectomy usually stimulates breast cancer growth (2– 4). epidemiological studies
have shown a low incidence of breast tumors in blind women as
well as an inverse relationship between breast cancer incidence
and the degree of visual impairment. because light inhibits
melatonin secretion, the increase in melatonin-circulating levels might be interpreted as proof of the protective role of this
hormone on mammary carcinogenesis (5). a moderate increase
in breast cancer risk among women who worked extended
periods of rotating night shifts (light exposure during night
suppresses melatonin production) has also been described (6).
different mechanisms have been proposed to explain how
melatonin could reduce the development of mammary tumors;
they are indirect neuroendocrine mechanisms such as melatonin regulation of some pituitary and gonadal hormones that
control tumor growth (1, 4 –7) and the direct effects of melatonin as an endogenous hydroxyl radical scavenger (8) or as a
modulator of the immune response to the presence of a malignant neoplasm (9, 10). on the other hand, direct anti-estrogenic melatonin actions at the cellular level have been proposed (11, 12). studies using mcf-7 human breast cancer cells
(er⫹)1 (an estrogen-dependent model system, as is the case for
more than 60% of primary breast tumors) demonstrate that
physiological concentrations of melatonin (1 nm to 1 pm) exert a
direct anti-proliferative effect on estrogen-induced proliferation of these cells (11, 12) and reduce their invasiveness, causing a decrease in cell attachment and cell motility, probably by
interacting with estrogen-mediated mechanisms (13). however, the molecular basis of melatonin action remains largely
unknown.
in a previous report (14), we presented evidence that melatonin interferes with estrogen-signaling pathways. we demonstrated that melatonin acts as anti-estrogen by preventing the
estrogen-dependent transcriptional activation in mcf-7 cells
through destabilization of the e2䡠er complex from binding to
dna, and we proposed calmodulin (cam) as a potential candidate for mediating the anti-estrogenic effects of melatonin.
several lines of evidence support this hypothesis; the interaction of this calcium-regulated protein with er has been known
for several years, and a number of cam antagonists exhibit
anti-estrogenic activity and decrease the affinity of er␣ for its
ligand as well as the stability of e2䡠er binding to dna (15). in
addition, it has been shown that melatonin binds to calmodulin
in a ca2⫹-dependent fashion, resulting in the inhibition of
calmodulin (16, 17).

melatonin is an indole hormone produced mainly by
the pineal gland. we have previously demonstrated that
melatonin interferes with estrogen (e2) signaling in
mcf7 cells by impairing  xxxg730xxx  (er) pathways. here we present the characterization of its mechanism of action showing that melatonin is a specific
inhibitor of e2-induced er␣-mediated transcription in
both estrogen response element- and  xxxg1222xxx -containing
promoters, whereas er␤-mediated transactivation is
not inhibited or even activated at certain promoters. we
show that the sensitivity of mcf-7 cells to melatonin
depends on the er␣/er␤ ratio, and ectopic expression
of er␤ results in mcf-7 cells becoming insensitive to
this hormone. melatonin acts as a calmodulin antagonist
inducing conformational changes in the er␣-calmodulin (cam) complex, thus impairing the binding of
e2䡠er␣䡠cam complex to dna and, therefore, preventing
er␣-dependent transcription. moreover the mutant
er␣ (k302g,k303g), unable to bind calmodulin, becomes insensitive to melatonin. the effect of melatonin
is specific since other related indoles neither interact
with cam nor inhibit er␣-mediated transactivation. interestingly, melatonin does not affect the binding of coactivators to er␣, indicating that melatonin action is
different from that of current therapeutic anti-estrogens used in breast cancer therapy. thus, they target
er␣ at different levels, representing two independent
ways to control er␣ activity. it is, therefore, conceivably a synergistic pharmacological effect of melatonin
and current anti-estrogen drugs.

melatonin, an er␣-specific inhibitor via cam
in the search for differences between er␣ and the most
recently described er␤, we analyzed the interaction of both
receptors with calmodulin, and we demonstrated that er␣ but
not er␤ directly interacts with calmodulin. consequently,
cam antagonists are selective modulators of er␣-mediated
transcription (18). in the present study, we have investigated
whether calmodulin could be a link between melatonin and the
estrogen-signaling pathway. our results indicate that melatonin acts as specific inhibitor of er␣ at physiological doses, and
therefore, clinical studies on the possible therapeutic value of
melatonin on breast cancer should be considered.
experimental procedures

mcdonnell et al. (21). an aliquot (4.5 ␮l) of reticulocyte lysate was
incubated for 20 min in the absence or presence of 1 ␮m 17␤-estradiol,
1 nm melatonin, and 1 ␮m w7 as indicated. equal aliquots of the
untreated or the hormone-treated receptor were subsequently incubated with a trypsin solution (roche applied science), giving final
enzyme concentration of 25 ␮g/ml. after 10 min of incubation at room
temperature, the digestion reaction was terminated by the addition of
gel-denaturing buffer and boiling for 5 min. the products of the digestion procedure were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide-sds gel. after
electrophoresis the gel was treated with a 0.5 m  xxxd3219xxx 
solution for 15 min. the gel was dried under vacuum, and the radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography. when indicated, 1
␮g of goat polyclonal anti-cam antibodies (sc-1988, santa cruz biotechnology, inc.) was added before the treatment with hormones.
in vitro protein-protein interaction assays—gst fusion proteins
were expressed and purified essentially as described by frangioni and
neel (22). gst pull-down experiments were performed as previously
described by cavailles et al. (23). 35s-labeled src-1a coactivator was
synthesized by in vitro transcription-translation (promega) using pcrsrc-1a as template. the gst fusion proteins loaded on glutathionesepharose beads (25 ␮l) were preincubated with 1 ␮m concentrations of
ligands (17␤-estradiol, 4- xxxd91xxx , or  xxxd2165xxx ,780) or 1 nm
melatonin for 30 min at 4 °c followed by incubation with 35s-labeled
proteins for 1.5 h at 4 °c in a total volume of 150 ␮l of ipab buffer (20
mm hepes-koh, ph 7.9, 5 mm mgcl2, 150 mm kcl, 0.02 mg/ml bovine  xxxg124xxx , 0.1% (v/v) triton x-100, 0.1% nonidet p-40,
and protease inhibitors). beads were washed 4 –5 times with ipab
without bovine  xxxg124xxx , collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 20 ␮l of loading buffer for sds-page analysis. the gel was
vacuum-dried, and the radiolabeled products were visualized by
autoradiography.
in vitro interaction with dansyl-cam—fluorescence experiments
were performed in a perkinelmer life sciences fluorimeter using a
100-␮l cuvette. 2.5 nmol of dansyl-cam (sigma) were dissolved in 100
␮l of 10 mm mops, ph 7.2, 1 mm mgcl2, 100 mm kcl, and 1 mm cacl2.
emission fluorescent spectra were obtained (␭ex 333 nm) before and
after the addition of 1 nm melatonin or the indole derivatives. equivalent amounts of buffer were added in the controls.
results

melatonin is a specific inhibitor of er␣-mediated transcription—we have previously demonstrated that melatonin is able
to inhibit estrogen-dependent transcription and proliferation in
mcf-7 cells (14). because mcf-7 is a carcinoma-derived cell
line (er⫹) that endogenously expresses both er␣ and er␤, we
further investigated the inhibitory effect of melatonin on e2dependent transactivation mediated by each receptor isoform
independently. for this purpose, we transiently transfected
hela cells with either er␣ or er␤ expression vectors along
with the ere-driven reporter plasmids peretkluc (fig. 1a),
ps2luc (fig. 1b), or 3xereluc (fig. 1c). in all cases 10 nm e2
stimulated transcription for both er␣- and er␤-transfected
cells. as expected, the highest e2 stimulation was obtained
using a strong promoter containing three ere sites (fig. 1c).
physiological concentrations of melatonin (1 nm) inhibited
er␣-mediated transactivation by 45– 60% depending on the
promoter tested. in contrast, er␤-mediated transcription was
not affected (fig. 1, b and c) or even potentiated (fig. 1a) by
this concentration of melatonin. in titration experiments we
observed that melatonin inhibited er␣-mediated transcription
in a dose-dependent manner, whereas er␤ activity was unaffected by the different concentrations of melatonin assayed
(fig. 1d). these results indicate that melatonin is a selective
modulator of er␣, as we have recently described for cam
antagonists (18).
an er␣ mutant unable to bind cam is insensitive to melatonin—in a previous report we demonstrated that residues
lys-302 and lys-303 of her␣ are essential for cam binding.
although the wild-type er␣ normally binds to cam, substitution of lysines 302 and 303 by glycine abolished the interaction
of er␣ (k302g,k303g) with cam (18). transcriptional activation studies further demonstrated that these two critical resi-

cell culture and transient transfection assays—hela cells were
propagated as previously described (18). before transfection, hela cells
were seeded in 12-well plates and incubated for 12–18 h at 37 °c. then
cells were transferred to phenol red-free dulbecco’s modified eagle’s
medium containing 0.5% charcoal, dextran-treated fetal calf serum and
maintained for 3 days. at 60 – 80% confluency, cells were transfected
with 0.5 ␮g of estrogen response element (ere)-driven or  xxxg1222xxx -driven
reporter plasmids, 0.1 ␮g of er expression vector, and 50 ng of an
internal control renilla luciferase plasmid, prl-tk (promega), using
fugene 6 transfection reagent from roche applied science following
the manufacturer’s protocols. after 18 –24 h, medium was renewed, and
cells were stimulated for 24 h with different chemicals as indicated.
luciferase was assayed with the dual luciferase system (promega).
luciferase activities were normalized to renilla luciferase activity to
correct for differences in transfection efficiency. the results represent
the means ⫾ s.d. of three independent experiments performed at least
in duplicate. transactivation experiments were performed with both
mouse and human er␤, and identical trends in ligand behavior were
observed in both er␤s in hela cells.
mcf-7 cells were propagated in rpmi 1640 medium containing 25
mm hepes, naoh, ph 7.3, and synchronized cells were transfected as
above. when indicated, er␤ expression vector or the empty vector was
included in the transfection.
electrophoretic mobility shift assay—binding of the e2䡠er to ere
was performed as previously described (14). five to ten microliters of
nuclear extracts of transient transfections were mixed with buffer b (20
mm hepes-koh, ph 7.9, 10 mm mgcl2, 1 mm edta, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm kcl, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% nonidet p-40, and protease inhibitors) and incubated
with 1 ␮g of poly(di䡠dc) in a total volume of 40 ␮l. mixtures were
preincubated at 0 °c for 15 min followed by incubation with the indicated hormones at 0 °c for 10 min. 32p-labeled probe (10 fmol containing 3–5 ⫻ 104 dpm) corresponding to the ere from xenopus vitellogenin a2 gene was added to the reaction and allowed to proceed for 1 h at
0 °c followed by 30 min at room temperature. the samples were loaded
onto a pre-electrophoresed (10 ma) 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide
to bisacrylamide ratio of 40:1) in tbe (45 mm tris borate, 1 mm edta)
at 11 mv/cm. gels were vacuum-dried and exposed at ⫺80 °c to obtain
the autoradiography. for specificity assays, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was used as competitor before adding the probe to
the binding reaction.
proteolysis assays—the pcdna-er␣ plasmid (1 ␮g) containing fulllength cdna of the wild-type human er␣ was used to produce 35sradiolabeled er␣ using 40 ␮l of a coupled transcription-translation system according to the manufacturer’s instructions (promega).
the protease digestion was performed essentially as described by

melatonin, an er␣-specific inhibitor via cam

dues for er␣ binding to cam are not essential for er␣ transcriptional activation. thus, when hela cells were transiently
transfected with wild-type er␣ and compared with those
transfected with er␣ (k302g,k303g), both showed similar
levels of basal and e2-induced transcriptional activation (18).
however, er␣ transactivation was 80% inhibited by 10⫺6 m
w7, whereas transcription mediated by er␣ (k302g,k303g)
was completely insensitive to this calmodulin antagonist. if
melatonin acts as a calmodulin antagonist on er␣-mediated
transcription, we could predict no inhibitory effect of the pineal
hormone on er␣ (k302g,k303g)-mediated transactivation.
indeed, when hela cells were transiently transfected with
er␣ (k302g,k303g) along with the ere-driven reporter plasmid 3xereluc (fig. 1e) we observed that er␣ (k302g,
k303g) transcription was unaffected by the different concentrations of melatonin assayed.
the sensitivity of mcf7 cells to melatonin depends on the
er␣/er␤ ratio—in mcf7 cells increasing concentrations of
melatonin resulted in the progressive inhibition of the e2-dependent transcription, reaching nearly 100% of inhibition at
pharmacological concentrations of melatonin (fig. 2a). the

ic50 was obtained at 1.26 ⫻ 10⫺11 m as determined with graphpad prism.
we next analyzed whether the sensitivity of mcf7 cells to
inhibition by melatonin was associated with the high er␣/er␤
ratio present in these cells, as we have previously reported for
cam antagonists (18). to test this hypothesis, mcf7 cells were
transfected with the 3xereluc reporter plasmid in the absence or presence of an er␤ expression vector. we then determined whether er␤ overexpression affects the sensitivity of
these cells to melatonin and compared its effect to those of the
cam antagonists w7 and calmidazolium. as expected, both
melatonin and cam antagonists inhibited e2-dependent transcriptional activation in mcf7 cells (fig. 2b). interestingly,
the inhibitory effects of both melatonin and cam antagonists
were abolished by er␤ overexpression (fig. 2b). these results
imply that the sensitivity to melatonin of e2-induced transcription in mcf7 cells depends on the presence of er␣. inhibition
by melatonin correlates with a high er␣/er␤ ratio, whereas an
increased expression of er␤ impairs the effect of the hormone.
melatonin inhibits e2䡠er␣-mediated transcription in ap1containing promoters—we have previously demonstrated that

melatonin, an er␣-specific inhibitor via cam

cam is a regulator of er␣-mediated transcription in both ereand  xxxg1222xxx -containing promoters since transcription mediated by
both complexes is sensitive to cam antagonists (18). therefore,
we decided to test the ability of melatonin to inhibit transcription on er␣/ xxxg1222xxx  pathways. for that purpose, hela cells were
transfected with either er␣ or er␤ along with the reporter
plasmid ⌬coll-73-luc (containing an  xxxg1222xxx  binding site). even
though e2䡠er␣-mediated  xxxg1222xxx  activation in hela cells and
other cell lines have been described (24, 25), we and other
authors found it necessary to prime the cells with egf to
observe this effect. egf stabilizes the levels of c-jun and c-fos
family proteins, allowing a synergistic effect between these
factors and er␣ on  xxxg1222xxx  transcription (26, 27). we found that
 xxxg1222xxx  activity was increased by egf in cells expressing either
er␣ or er␤ (fig. 3). e2 significantly potentiated  xxxg1222xxx  activity
in er␣-transfected cells but diminished  xxxg1222xxx  activity in er␤transfected cells. these results agree with previous reports (26,
27) indicating that egf synergizes with e2. very importantly,
the synergistic effect of egf and e2 in cells expressing er␣
was sensitive to melatonin, whereas no effect was observed in
cells expressing er␤. both the activation by e2 and the inhibition by melatonin were statistically significant. we can infer
from these experiments that melatonin, as other cam antagonists, regulates er␣-mediated transcription not only in eredependent pathways but also in  xxxg1222xxx  pathways.
melatonin but not other indole derivatives interact with
cam—we have previously demonstrated that melatonin blocks
the binding of the e2䡠er complex to ere in vitro and that this
effect is dose-dependent, saturable, and specific, since different
methoxy- and hydroxyindoles have no effect on binding to dna
(14). therefore, we expected that other indole derivatives
would have no effect on e2䡠er␣-mediated transcription. to
analyze this possibility we carried out transient transfections
in mcf-7 cells using 3xere-luc as reporter plasmid. as shown
in fig. 4b, melatonin effectively inhibited (60%) e2-induced
transactivation, whereas treatment with other indole metabolites resulted in no significant decrease on the e2-mediated
transcription, indicating that the inhibitory effect of melatonin
on estrogen response is specific.
to further investigate the basis for the specific inhibition

exhibited by melatonin, we examined the ability of the indole
derivatives to bind to dansyl-cam. changes on emission fluorescence intensity of dansyl-cam reflect conformational/structural changes, suggesting interaction with cam. as observed in
fig. 4c, melatonin specifically decreased the fluorescence of
dansyl-cam, whereas the other indoles tested did not modify
the fluorescence of dansyl-cam, indicating that only melatonin
is able to interact with this protein. we hypothesize that melatonin acts as a cam antagonist, interfering with the er␣cam complex and that this is the underlying basis by which
melatonin specifically inhibits er␣-mediated transcription.
melatonin induces conformational changes on er␣ structure via cam—conformational changes on er␣ structure can
be shown by using a protease digestion assay as previously
described by mcdonnell et al. (21). also, w7 induces cam to
form a globular structure (29). we have determined the effects
of melatonin and w7 on er␣ structure on the basis of the
differential susceptibility of the receptor to proteolysis by trypsin. 35s-labeled er␣ was synthesized in vitro and preincubated with vehicle, e2, melatonin, w7, or combinations of these
compounds. the resulting complexes were then subjected to
limited digestion with trypsin, and the products were resolved
by sds-page (fig. 5). er␣ was highly sensitive to trypsin
degradation in the absence of ligand (fig. 5, lane 2), whereas in
the presence of e2, a trypsin-resistant 32-kda fragment was
observed (fig. 5, lane 4), in agreement with results previously
published (21). incubation of the labeled receptor in the presence of e2 plus either melatonin (fig. 5, lane 6) or w7 (fig. 5,
lane 8) yielded a distinct digestion patron as compared with e2
alone. under these conditions, er␣ becomes highly sensitive to
protease digestion. therefore, treatment with melatonin or
cam antagonists abolished the protective effect of e2 on limited trypsin digestion. interestingly, the effects of melatonin
(fig. 5, lane 5) and w7 (fig. 5, lane 7) were reverted in the
presence of anti-cam antibodies. taken together, our data
indicate that melatonin, similar to w7 through the interaction
with cam, induce conformational changes on er␣ that also
affect the stability of er␣ against proteolysis.
er␣ stability is not altered by melatonin—it has been reported that the inhibition of the interaction between cam and

whether the inhibition of er␣ activity by melatonin in mcf7

cells could be due to the modulation of the stability and the
state level of estrogen receptors. for this purpose, mcf7 cells
were treated for 24 h with either vehicle, e2, melatonin, tfp, or
combinations, and er protein levels were determined by western blot. as shown in fig. 6, e2 (fourth lane) and tfp (fifth

conducted electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear
extracts from hela cells transfected with er␣ or er␤ to determine the effect of melatonin on the e2-dependent binding of
each er isoform to ere. er␣ binding to ere was increased
3-fold in the presence of 10 nm e2 (fig. 8, lane 2). this binding
was 90% inhibited by the addition of 1 nm melatonin (fig. 8,
lane 3). in a similar way the binding of er␤ to ere was also
increased 2.5-fold in the presence of e2 (fig. 8, lane 5), but
contrary to er␣ the addition of melatonin stimulated the binding of er␤ to dna (fig. 8, lane 6). the specificity of the
retarded band was demonstrated by competition with a 100fold excess of unlabeled ere (fig. 8, lane 7).
taken together, our results indicate that melatonin induces
conformational changes in cam that selectively prevent er␣dependent transcription by destabilizing the binding of
e2䡠er␣䡠cam complex to dna either by modulating er stability at protein level or by impairing coactivator binding to the
receptor.
discussion

melatonin is an indole hormone secreted by the pineal gland
only during the night or, more exactly, in darkness. one of the
proposed properties of melatonin is its role as an oncostatic
agent on hormone-dependent tumors. it has also been described that melatonin exerts antiproliferative effects on mcf7
cells, which has become a useful model to study the antiestrogenic effect of the  xxxd2559xxx  (11, 32–35). in synchronized mcf7 cells, both estrogen-dependent transcription and
proliferation are inhibited by co-treatment with melatonin. it
has been shown that melatonin binds to calmodulin in a ca2⫹dependent fashion, resulting in inhibition of calmodulin (16,
17). we have proposed (14) that calmodulin might be a potential candidate to mediate the anti-estrogenic effects of melatonin. in this regard, we have recently demonstrated that er␣
but not er␤ interacts with calmodulin, and mutations in the
postulated (36) er␣ calmodulin binding site abolish this inter-

lane) significantly reduced er␣ content in mcf7 cells, in
agreement with previous data (30). strikingly, treatment with
100 nm melatonin does not alter the amount of er␣ in the cells
(fig. 6, second lane), indicating that inhibition of er␣-mediated transcription by melatonin is not due to a reduction in er
protein levels. importantly, neither tfp nor melatonin affected
er␤ levels, suggesting that the interaction with cam is important to trigger degradation since er␣ but not er␤ interacts
with calmodulin.
effect of melatonin on coactivator binding properties of
er␣—er␣ is a transcriptional factor allosterically regulated
by ligand, which promotes gene transcription by recruiting
coactivator proteins in a ligand-dependent manner (31). because melatonin actions involve alterations on er structure
that could interfere with the association of factors required for
er activity, we analyzed whether melatonin affects the binding
of the coactivator src-1a to er␣. gst pull-down experiments
were performed by using 35s-labeled src-1a and gst-er␣(117–595) purified and immobilized on gsh-sepharose as an
affinity reagent (fig. 7, a and b). as expected, the binding of
src-1a to er␣ was stimulated 3-fold in the presence of e2, and
the presence of the estrogenic antagonists 4- xxxd91xxx 
( xxxd3285xxx ) and ici blocked this association to er␣ (28). by contrast, the e2-dependent interaction of src-1a with er␣ was
unaffected by melatonin. both melatonin and anti-estrogens
failed to induce by themselves src-1a association to er␣.
these results strongly suggest that the mechanism of melatonin action differs from those of anti-estrogens such as  xxxd3285xxx  or
ici, which exert inhibitory effects on er activity by impairing
coactivator recruitment.
because melatonin induces conformational changes on er␣
structure and this fact seems to have no consequences on the
binding of coactivators, we postulate that cam and coactivator
binding to er are independent phenomena. to check this, we
determined whether forms of er␣ unbound to cam retain the
ability to interact with coactivators. this was accomplished in
another set of gst pull-down experiments using 35s-labeled
src-1a and the hybrid protein gst-er␣-(280 –595), which is
unable to bind cam (18) immobilized on gst-sepharose as
affinity reagent (fig. 7, c and d). under these conditions the
binding of src-1a to gst-er␣-(280 –595) was induced by e2,
and once again the presence of melatonin had no effect on this
interaction, whereas the presence of  xxxd3285xxx  impaired src-1a
association. these results indicate that the binding of cam to
er␣ is not a prerequisite for the recruitment of coactivators
and that these are two independent mechanisms for the regulation of er␣ activity.
melatonin selectively prevents the binding of e2䡠er␣ complex to ere in vitro—we have investigated whether the selective inhibition of er␣-mediated transcription by melatonin is
exerted at the level of dna binding. to accomplish this, we

action (18). the mutant receptor is otherwise fully functional
promoting e2-dependent transcription. as a consequence of the
interaction of the receptor with this calcium ligand protein,
cam antagonists act as specific inhibitors of er␣ in a dose-dependent manner but show no inhibitory effect on er␤- mediated transcription both in ere- and  xxxg1222xxx -driven promoters
(18). considering the observations mentioned above, we addressed the question of whether the inhibitory effects observed
in mcf7 cells treated with melatonin were exerted via cam.
for this purpose we studied the effect of melatonin on e2-dependent transactivation mediated by each receptor in transfected hela cells. we found that similarly to cam antagonists,
melatonin inhibits e2䡠er␣-induced transcription at several
ere-driven promoters, whereas er␤ activation is not inhibited (or even enhanced at certain promoters) by treatment with
the hormone. importantly, the er␣ (k302g,k303g) mutant,
which does not interact with cam, is not inhibited by melato-

nin and behaves in a similar fashion to that of the er␤ receptor. this result strongly suggests that the effect of the hormone
is directly exerted through the calmodulin bound to er␣ and
not through indirect pathways. all the data mentioned above
indicate that melatonin is a selective modulator of estrogen
receptors. this observation is extremely important since more
than 60% of breast cancers show overexpression of er␣, and
the ratio er␣/er␤ increases during breast and ovarian tumor
progression (37). therefore, melatonin, as we have previously
suggested for cam antagonists, might have the potential to act
as an er␣ inhibitor with antitumor effects on advanced breast,
ovarian, and colon cancer.
we have attempted to determine if the inhibitory effects
observed in mcf7 cells treated with melatonin are associated
with the high er␣/er␤ ratio present in these cells as we have
reported for cam antagonists (18). indeed, in mcf7 cells expressing ectopic er␤, the inhibitory effects of melatonin and

melatonin, an er␣-specific inhibitor via cam

tonin does not inhibit its actions. how then does melatonin
inhibit transcription? we have investigated whether the differential action of melatonin on e2-dependent transcription by
er␣ and er␤ was exerted on binding of er to dna. we
performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using nuclear
extracts from hela cells expressing either er␣ or er␤ to
determine the effect of melatonin on the e2-dependent binding
of each receptor isoform to ere. the binding of er␣ to dna
was increased in the presence of estradiol and inhibited by
melatonin. on the other hand, melatonin further enhanced the
binding of er␤ to dna, which might explain why at certain
promoters co-treatment with e2 and melatonin enhanced er␤
transcriptional activity.
as mentioned above, the ratio er␤/er␣, which is high in
normal tissues, decreases during breast and ovarian tumor
progression (43) and in both male and female malignant transformation of the colon (44, 45). notably a large scale study
conducted on long time night-shift workers indicates that those
working night shifts at least three nights per month for 15
years or longer have a moderate but significant increase in the
risk of developing breast and colon cancer (6, 46). because the
levels of er␤ are reduced during tumor progression in most
colon cancers, melatonin might be important for prevention of
the breast and colon malignancies acting through er␣. our
results favor the concept that melatonin and cam antagonists
could be of therapeutic importance in tumors with high er␣/
er␤ ratio, that is, in advanced tumors. in addition, cam antagonists alone or in combination with anti-estrogens have
been reported to decrease the viability and induce apoptosis of
breast cancer cells (47– 49). melatonin decreased toxicity and
increased efficacy of cancer chemotherapy in metastatic patients with poor clinical status (50).
in summary, the reported data and the results presented in
this work strongly suggest that melatonin or melatonin derivatives with no toxicity and higher efficacy than the pineal
hormone may have the potential to act as inhibitory agents of
er␣ with anti-tumor effects on advanced breast, ovarian, and
colon tumors. therefore, clinical studies on the possible therapeutic value of melatonin on these cancers should be performed
in the future.

cam antagonists were abolished. these results imply that the
sensitivity to melatonin correlates with a high er␣/er␤ ratio.
because we had previously found that cam antagonists also
inhibit er␣-dependent  xxxg1222xxx  transcriptional activity (18) we
tested the ability of melatonin to inhibit er␣-mediated transcription in  xxxg1222xxx -driven promoters. as expected, melatonin significantly inhibited  xxxg1222xxx /er␣ activation by e2. therefore, melatonin also acts as a regulator of the er␣-cam/ xxxg1222xxx  pathway.
cam inhibitors and tamoxifen have been reported to show
synergistic inhibitory effects (33). thus, we propose that melatonin could be a valuable tool to block the mitogenic activity of
er␣ in both anti-estrogen-responsive and anti-estrogen-resistant breast cancer cells.
we have previously reported that melatonin blocks the binding of e2䡠er complex to ere in vitro, but other methoxy- and
hydroxyindoles were not effective in doing so. therefore, we
predicted that these compounds would have neither effect on
e2-dependent transactivation nor ability to bind dansyl-cam.
the effect of melatonin is indeed, specific, since none of the
compounds tested inhibited e2-dependent transcription or
modified the fluorescence of dansyl-cam.
the next question we addressed was whether melatonin has
any effect on the stability of er␣, as it has been described for
other calmodulin antagonists (30). mcf7 cells treated with
cam antagonist tfp show a 50% reduction in the er levels,
and nearly all the receptor disappeared when cgs9343b was
used. these compounds did not significantly modify the level of
er mrna. it has been, therefore, proposed that calmodulin
stabilizes the receptor against proteolysis (30). the same authors suggested that the inhibitory effect of w7 on er␣-mediated transcription that we have previously reported (18) might
be due to the reduction in er-protein levels induced by cam
antagonists (38, 39). treatment with melatonin did not alter
the amount of er␣ present in mcf7 cells, whereas cells
treated with tfp did show a reduction in the er levels similar
to that previously reported (37). therefore, the possibility that
melatonin inhibits er␣ transcription as a consequence of degradation of the receptor can be excluded. notably, the levels of
er␤ remain unaffected in all the conditions assayed.
we next investigated melatonin to determine if it might
interfere with the association of factors required for er␣ activity. anti-estrogens induce a conformational change in the
receptor different to that of e2 in such way that corepressors
and not coactivators bind to the receptor in the presence of the
tamoxifen (40). we, therefore, considered the possibility that
melatonin might have a similar effect and that the conformational change induced by melatonin on cam might imply another change on er␣ structure in such way that coactivator
association to the receptor would be impaired. we have analyzed the binding of the coactivator src-1a to er␣. we found
that, as previously reported (41, 42), the binding of src-1a to
er␣ was stimulated by e2, whereas the presence of the estrogenic antagonists  xxxd3285xxx  and ici blocked this association. on the
other hand, e2-dependent interaction of src-1a with er␣ was
unaffected by melatonin, indicating that this is not the mechanism by which melatonin exerts its inhibitory effect on er␣mediated transcription. we have also shown that cam and
coactivator binding to er␣ are independent phenomena, since
a gst fusion with a truncated er␣ unable to interact with
cam recruits src-1a, and this association is enhanced by estradiol and inhibited by  xxxd3285xxx  and ici. in other words, our
results strongly suggest that cam binding to er␣ is not a necessary event for coactivator recruitment. this idea is further
supported by the fact that the mutant er␣ (k302g,k303g),
which does not bind cam, mediates transcription in a similar
way to that of wild-type er␣, although treatment with mela-
