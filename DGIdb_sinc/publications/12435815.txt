abstract
chronic opioid agonist treatment produces tolerance and in
some cases opioid receptor internalization and down-regulation. both morphine and  xxxd2070xxx  induce tolerance; however,
only  xxxd2070xxx  produces ␮-opioid receptor (␮or) down-regulation. in vitro studies implicate dynamin-2 (dyn-2) and gprotein receptor kinase-2 (grk-2) in these processes. therefore, we examined  xxxd2070xxx  and morphine effects on
regulation of grk-2 and dyn-2 in mouse spinal cord. mice
were treated for 7 days with  xxxd2070xxx  (200 ␮g/kg/day infusion)
or morphine (40 mg/kg/day infusion ⫹ one 25-mg implant
pellet). controls were implanted with a placebo pellet. on the
7th day after implantation mice were tested for i.t. [d-ala2,nme-phe4,gly5-ol]-enkephalin (damgo) analgesia. in other
mice, spinal cord was removed for [3h]damgo binding studies

opioid agonists have been shown to produce tolerance and
in some cases internalization and down-regulation of opioid
receptors (duttaroy and yoburn, 1995; keith et al., 1996;
yabaluri and medzihradsky, 1997; whistler et al., 1999;
shen et al., 2000; zaki et al., 2000). the ability of opioid
agonists to regulate ␮or has been suggested to be related to
the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist. for example, chronic
treatment with low intrinsic efficacy agonists (e.g., morphine) may cause blunting of receptor signaling (desensitization) without any change in surface receptor number (yoburn
et al., 1993; burford et al., 1998; van bockstaele and commons, 2001). conversely, chronic exposure to high intrinsic
efficacy opioid agonists (e.g.,  xxxd2070xxx ) can internalize and
down-regulate opioid receptors, as well as produce desensitization (duttaroy and yoburn, 1995; yabaluri and medzihradsky, 1997; whistler et al., 1999; shen et al., 2000; zaki et al.,

determined. both  xxxd2070xxx  and morphine produced significant
tolerance (ed50 shift ⫽ 7.6- and 7.3-fold for morphine and
 xxxd2070xxx , respectively).  xxxd2070xxx  decreased spinal ␮or density by ⬇30%, whereas morphine did not change ␮or density.
 xxxd2070xxx  increased (⬇70%) dyn-2 protein abundance and
decreased its mrna (31%), whereas it had no effect on grk-2
protein and mrna abundance. morphine had no effect on
either dyn-2 or grk-2 protein or mrna abundance. these
data raise the possibility that unequal receptor regulation by
 xxxd2070xxx  and morphine might be due to differential regulation
of trafficking proteins. overall, receptor down-regulation associated with chronic  xxxd2070xxx  treatment may accelerate dynamin-related activity. finally, the decrease in dyn-2 mrna
may be related to stabilization of dyn-2 protein abundance,
which might inhibit transcription.

2000). internalization of ␮or has also been noted after acute
 xxxd2070xxx  and opioid peptide treatment (trafton et al., 2000;
van bockstaele and commons, 2001). although decreases in
receptor density depend upon the agonist used, recent studies suggest that down-regulation of ␮or, although not required for opioid tolerance, can contribute to opioid tolerance
(stafford et al., 2001).
chronic agonist treatment has been shown to regulate
g-protein-coupled receptor (gpcr) density in cell culture
studies. agonist-induced activation of g-protein receptor kinase (grk) seems to precede receptor phosphorylation. once
the receptor has been phosphorylated, ␤-arrestin translocates to the plasma membrane and uncouples the receptor/
g-protein complex, which may be followed by congregation of
receptors in clathrin-coated pits and subsequent dynamin
(dyn)-mediated internalization (carman and benovic, 1998;
krupnick and benovic, 1998). both grk-2 and dyn-2 have
been shown to play an important role in agonist-mediated
internalization of ␮or (zhang et al., 1998; whistler and von
zastrow, 1998). dominant negative mutants of grk-2 and
dyn-2 inhibit agonist-induced internalization of ␮or (whistler and von zastrow, 1998; zhang et al., 1998; lazari et al.,
1999; gaborik et al., 2001). furthermore, overexpression of

trafficking proteins and ␮-opioid receptor regulation

grk-2 or ␤-arrestin 2 confers on morphine the ability to
induce receptor internalization in vitro (whistler and von
zastrow, 1998; zhang et al., 1998). it is possible that some
agonists (e.g.,  xxxd2070xxx ) may effectively regulate these trafficking proteins more than other agonists (e.g., morphine).
differences in regulation of opioid receptor density by agonists could be due to variations in the characteristics of the
agonist-receptor conformation. for example, morphine,
damgo, and endomorphin i activate cognate heterotrimeric
g-proteins with the same profile; however, only damgo and
endomorphin i induced ␮or internalization (burford et al.,
1998). furthermore, ␮or down-regulation in vivo has been
demonstrated to be independent of functional g-protein signaling (gomes et al., 2002). these results suggest that different agonists activate g-proteins similarly but that some
agonists render receptors into conformations that are more
suitable as substrates for trafficking proteins (e.g., ␤-arrestin, grk, and dyn) (burford et al., 1998; whistler and von
zastrow, 1998).
taken together, these data support suggestions that proteins identified in cell culture studies, such as grk-2 and
dyn-2, may play an important role in trafficking of ␮or in
vivo. in the present study, we explored whether opioid agonists that differ in their ability to regulate ␮or also differ in
regulation of trafficking proteins in vivo. to our knowledge
this is the first in vivo study that examines regulation of ␮or
and intracellular trafficking proteins by agonists of different
intrinsic efficacy.

materials and methods
subjects. male swiss-webster mice (22–24 g) (taconic farms,
germantown, ny) were used in all experiments. the animals were
housed 10 per cage for at least 24 h with free access to food and water
before experimentation. mice were used only once.
general procedure. mice were implanted subcutaneously with
an osmotic minipump (alzet model 2001; alza, palo alto, ca) that
infused  xxxd2070xxx  (200 ␮g/kg/day, 1 ␮l/h). for morphine, mice were
implanted subcutaneously with an osmotic minipump that infused
morphine (40 mg/kg/day) plus one 25-mg implant pellet. the morphine implant pellet and the minipump infusion protocol were based
on previous studies that demonstrated that this treatment produced
reliable and significant tolerance (stafford et al., 2001). all controls
were implanted with inert placebo pellets. the pumps and pellets
were implanted at the nape of the neck while mice were lightly
anesthetized with halothane/oxygen (4:96). seven days after  xxxd2070xxx , morphine, or placebo treatment, mice were tested for antinociception or sacrificed and spinal cords were collected for receptor
binding studies, western blotting, or for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr) assays. in the case of antinociception and binding studies, pumps and pellets were removed on day 7
and 4 h after morphine and 16 h after  xxxd2070xxx  assays were conducted.
␮-opioid receptor binding assay. binding was performed as
described by yoburn et al. (1995). briefly, pumps and pellets were
removed on day 7 of  xxxd2070xxx , morphine, or placebo treatment. mice
(n ⫽ 12/treatment) were sacrificed 4 h after termination of morphine
and 16 h after termination of  xxxd2070xxx  treatment (yoburn et al.,
1993). controls were treated similarly. spinal cords were removed
and homogenized in 80 volumes of ice-cold 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph
7.4). homogenates were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 15 min, supernatants were discarded, and pellets were resuspended and incubated for 30 min at 25°c in ice-cold 50 mm  xxxd3449xxx  (ph 7.4).
homogenates were centrifuged again and the pellets were finally
resuspended in 20 to 80 volumes of 50 mm phosphate buffer (ph 7.2).

1465

an aliquot (200 ␮l) of homogenate was assayed in triplicate in tubes
containing 0.03 to 5 nm [3h]damgo (␮-ligand; perkinelmer life
sciences, boston, ma). nonspecific binding was determined in the
presence of 1000 nm levorphanol. tubes were incubated for 90 min
at 25°c and then the incubation was terminated by filtration of
samples over gf/b glass fiber filters (brandel inc., gaithersburg,
md). filters were washed three times with cold phosphate buffer
and transferred to vials containing scintillation cocktail and then
counted. the cpm values were converted to dpm values using the
external standard method. protein was assayed by the bradford
method (bradford, 1976) with reagent purchased from bio-rad (hercules, ca).
analgesia assay. analgesia (antinociception) was determined
using the tail-flick assay in which a beam of light was focused on the
dorsal tail surface approximately 2 cm from the tip of the tail. the
intensity of the light was adjusted so that baseline tail-flick latencies
were 2 to 4 s. mice (n ⫽ 6/dose/treatment) were then briefly anesthetized using halothane and injected intrathecally with damgo
(0.2–15 ng/4 ␮l/mouse for placebo; 3.8–60 ng/4 ␮l/mouse for  xxxd2070xxx ; and 15–120 ng/4 ␮l/mouse for morphine) and tested for analgesia 30 min later. if a mouse failed to flick by 10 s after damgo
administration, the test was terminated and a latency of 10 s was
recorded. mice that had a latency of 10 s were defined as analgesic.
all testing was conducted in a blind manner.
western blotting. mice (n ⫽ 12/treatment) were sacrificed 7
days after  xxxd2070xxx , morphine, or placebo treatment. spinal cords
were removed and homogenized (polytron homogenizer at 20,000
rpm for 30 s) in 2 ml of lysis buffer (2% sds, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 12.5 mm tris, ph 7.4), boiled for 5 min, and
centrifuged  xxxd1891xxx ,000 rpm for 10 min. the supernatant was removed
for analysis and protein concentration was determined (bradford,
1976). an aliquot (four spinal cords/tube) of the sample (8 ␮l, 0.6–12
␮g of protein) was loaded on polyacrylamide gels (pager gels 10%
tg; biowhittaker, rockland, me) and samples were separated by
electrophoresis (150 v for 60 min). proteins were transferred to
polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (bio-rad) using the miniprotean ii (bio-rad) at 100 v for 75 min. nonspecific binding sites on the
membrane were blocked by incubation (1 h, 24°c) in blocking buffer
[0.2% aurora blocking reagent (icn pharmaceuticals, costa mesa,
ca), 1⫻ phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.1% tween 20) followed by
incubation (1 h, 24°c) with primary antibody in blocking buffer
[rabbit polyclonal igg for grk-2 (1:200); goat polyclonal igg for
dyn-2 (1:300); santa cruz biotechnology, santa cruz, ca)]. membranes were washed twice with blocking buffer and then incubated (1
h, 24°c) with secondary antibody in blocking buffer [anti-rabbit
igg-alkaline phosphatase for grk-2 (1:5000); anti-goat igg-alkaline
phosphatase for dyn-2 (1:5000); santa cruz biotechnology]. membranes were then washed three times with blocking buffer followed
by two quick rinses with assay buffer (200 mm tris-hcl, ph 9.8, and
10 mm mgcl2). membranes were then incubated for 5 min in chemiluminescent substrate solution containing optimembrane (150 ␮l
optimembrane in 3 ml of starlight ready-to-use solution; icn pharmaceuticals). target proteins were visualized by capturing chemiluminescence using a fluorchem version 2.0 imaging system (alpha
innotech corporation, san leandro, ca). the images were digitized
and analyzed for optical density using gelpro image analysis software (version 3.0; media cybernetics, silver spring, md).
a standard curve using increasing amounts (0.2–20 ␮g) of spinal
cord sample was included in each gel assay. this allowed conversion
of optical density into valid estimates of percentage of changes in
protein. all data are expressed as percentage of control.
rt-pcr assay. total rna was extracted from mouse spinal cord
(n ⫽ 3/treatment) using trizol reagent (invitrogen, carlsbad, ca)
and precipitated in 100%  xxxd2400xxx . yeast trna (25 ␮g) was
added as a carrier to facilitate the precipitation of rna prepared
from a single spinal cord. the pellet was washed in 75% ethanol,
dried, and suspended in 100 ␮l of rnase-free water. the tubes were
then treated with 2 units of rnase-free dnase (maxi script kit;

1466

patel et al.

ambion, austin, tx) at 37°c for 30 min. rna was stored at ⫺80°c
until analysis. the yield of rna was determined using uv-spectrometry (260 and 280 nm).
the rt-pcr assay was based on the thermostable rtth rna pcr
kit (applied biosystems, foster city, ca). the primers for mouse
dyn-2 were cag ttt gga  xxxg889xxx  gac ttt gag aagc (forward)
and aga cag ggc tct ttc agc ttg acc (backward) corresponding to bases 131 to 155 and 1379 to 1402 (272-bp product). the
primers for mouse grk-2 were aga agt atc tgg agg acc
gagg (forward) and tct ttg aaa agg gat  xxxg889xxx  agc aggc
(backward) corresponding to bases 131 to 152 and 355 to 379 (249-bp
product).
the reverse transcription reaction used 0.18 ␮g of spinal rna.
the initial reaction mixture contained backward primers 1 ␮m for
murine dyn-2 and 0.75 ␮m for grk-2 mrnas, 200 ␮m dntps, 1
mm mncl2, and 5 units of rtth dna polymerase in 10⫻ rtth reverse
transcriptase buffer (100 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.3, and 900 mm kcl).
total volume was brought to 10 ␮l with diethyl pyrocarbonate water.
tubes were then placed in a techne progene thermal cycler (techne,
princeton, nj) at 70°c for 10 min for reverse transcription reaction.
next, 10⫻ chelating buffer [4% (v/v) glycerol, 8 mm tris-hcl, ph 8.3,
0.08 m kcl, 0.04% (w/v) tween 20, 0.6 mm egta, and 20 mm
mgcl2], 25 mm mgcl2, and forward primers 1 ␮m for dyn-2 and
0.75 ␮m for grk-2 were added into the reaction tubes. total volume
was brought to 50 ␮l with diethyl pyrocarbonate water. pcr was
then carried out in the thermocycler under the following conditions:
a 60-s incubation at 95°c, followed by amplification for 35 cycles at
95°c for 10 s and 60°c for 15 s, followed by a final extension at 60°c
for 7 min. tubes were brought to 4°c, 1 ␮l of loading dye (ambion)
was added to each tube, and then a 5-␮l aliquot containing amplified
product was loaded on 1.8% agarose gel and electrophoresed (100 v,
55 min). dna products were then visualized with uv light and
captured using fluorchem version 2.0 imaging system (alpha innotech corporation). the rt-pcr assay yielded the predicted size
amplification products for dyn-2 (272 bp) and grk-2 (249 bp). the
gel image was digitized (gel-pro version 3.0) and bands analyzed for
optical density. a standard curve for dyn-2 and grk-2 mrna using
0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 ␮g of total rna was included in each assay so
as to reliably estimate percentage of changes in target mrnas. the
standard curves were used to convert optical densities to arbitrary
rna units for both dyn-2- and grk-2-amplified products.
drugs and chemicals.  xxxd2070xxx  hydrochloride, damgo, morphine pellets, and corresponding placebo pellets were obtained from
research triangle institute (research triangle park, nc) through
the research technology branch of the national institute on drug
abuse.  xxxd2670xxx  was obtained from penick laboratories
(newark, nj). [3h]damgo was obtained from perkinelmer life
sciences (boston, ma).  xxxd2070xxx  and morphine were dissolved in
0.9% saline. the pellets were wrapped in nylon mesh before subcutaneous implantation.
data analysis. western blot analysis and rt-pcr data were
analyzed by t tests. quantal dose-response data were analyzed by
probit analysis using a computerized program (bliss 21; department of statistics, university of edinburg, edingburg, scotland) that
estimated ed50 values (95% confidence interval) and relative potencies. bmax and kd were estimated from saturation studies using
nonlinear regression (prism version 3.02; graphpad software, san
diego, ca). binding data were best fit by a one-site model.

cell culture studies have implicated grk-2 and dyn in
the trafficking of gpcrs, including ␮or (gagnon et al.,

of ␮or (zhang et al., 1998; whistler and von zastrow, 1998;

tion in grk-2 and dyn-2 protein abundance in vivo (patel et
al., 2002). however, the mechanisms involved in opioid receptor regulation after opioid agonist and antagonist treatment are different. for example, opioid agonist treatment is
associated with changes in gene expression of opioid receptors (kim et al., 1995; sehba et al., 1997; duttaroy and
yoburn, 2000) but antagonist treatment is not (jenab et al.,
1995; unterwald et al., 1995; however, see brodsky et al.,
1995; castelli et al., 1997; duttaroy et al., 1999). thus, it was
not certain that grk-2 and dyn-2 would be involved in
opioid agonist-induced ␮or regulation in vivo.
the present results indicate that differential regulation of
dyn-2 by  xxxd2070xxx  and morphine may account for differences in agonist-induced ␮or regulation.  xxxd2070xxx -induced
down-regulation was associated with an increase in spinal
dyn-2 protein and a decrease in dyn-2 mrna.  xxxd2070xxx 

did not change grk-2 protein or mrna abundance. on the
other hand, morphine, which does not down-regulate ␮or
density in intact animals (yoburn et al., 1993), had no effect
on either dyn-2 or grk-2 protein or mrna abundance.
both agonists produced tolerance to spinal damgo. because
dyn is involved in down-regulation of many gpcrs, including opioid receptors (gagnon et al., 1998; li et al., 2000), the
increase in dyn-2 levels after chronic  xxxd2070xxx  treatment
may accelerate sequestration of receptors and subsequent
receptor degradation. the reduction in dyn-2 mrna after
 xxxd2070xxx  treatment may be related to stabilization and increased abundance of dyn-2 protein, followed by feedback
inhibition of transcription.
although opioid agonists produce tolerance, it has been
suggested that only high intrinsic efficacy agonists produce

2002). the present results support the role for intrinsic efficacy in ␮or regulation, although morphine and  xxxd2070xxx 
differ in several other respects (e.g., receptor selectivity and
kinetics) in addition to intrinsic efficacy. nevertheless, several cellular mechanisms might mediate the differences in
opioid receptor regulation by opioid agonists. for example,
different agonist-receptor conformations may render the receptor a weak or strong substrate for trafficking proteins
such as grk-2 and ␤-arrestin (whistler and von zastrow,
1998; zhang et al., 1998). recently, an in vivo study has
demonstrated that g-protein signaling is not required for
agonist-induced down-regulation of ␮or (gomes et al.,
2002). these results suggest that even if morphine and  xxxd2070xxx  equivalently activate ␮or signaling, receptor conformations induced by some opioid agonists (e.g.,  xxxd2070xxx )
may be better substrates for trafficking proteins than others
(whistler and von zastrow, 1998; zhang et al., 1998).
the present data are consistent with suggestions that certain agonist-receptor conformations are superior substrates
for trafficking proteins. however, up-regulation of dyn-2 by
 xxxd2070xxx  suggests that internalization and down-regulation
may be accelerated by increases in some trafficking proteins.
the failure of morphine to alter grk-2, dyn-2, or ␮-opioid
receptor density, raises the possibility that opioid agonistinduced ␮or down-regulation in the mouse spinal cord may
require differential regulation of trafficking proteins (patel
et al., 2002). the failure of  xxxd2070xxx  and morphine to regulate grk-2 does not necessarily rule out a role for this protein in either tolerance or ␮-receptor down-regulation. it is
possible that sufficient levels of grk-2 are present to support
receptor internalization after  xxxd2070xxx , but that receptor
trafficking would be inhibited by grk-2 depletion. this suggestion is supported by decreases in grk-2 associated with
opioid antagonist-induced ␮or up-regulation (patel et al.,
2002).
although grk-mediated phosphorylation may be required
for internalization of opioid receptors (zhang et al., 1998;
hasbi et al., 2000), it is not known whether phosphorylation
is obligatory for lysosomal degradation of opioid receptors.
whistler et al. (2001) have shown that trafficking of mutant
␦-opioid receptors to lysosomes does not require phosphorylation of the receptor protein, even though phosphorylation
controls endocytic trafficking of mutant ␦-opioid receptors. in
addition, burd et al. (1998) have proposed that phosphorylation is not an obligatory event for  xxxd2070xxx -induced downregulation. in that study, agonist-mediated down-regulation
of the mutated ␮or was attenuated compared with wild-type
␮or. however, phosphorylation of the mutated ␮or was
similar to that of the wild-type ␮or. in the present study,
failure of  xxxd2070xxx  to regulate grk-2 further supports the
notion that phosphorylation might not be an obligatory event
for  xxxd2070xxx -induced ␮or down-regulation in mouse spinal
cord. however, this does not rule out opioid agonist-induced
changes in grk-2 in supraspinal regions. previous studies
have reported increases in some grks in some rat brain
regions after development of tolerance (terwilliger et al.,
1994; hurle, 2001). the differences between our results and

1469

these previous reports could be due to the central nervous
system region studied or the species differences.
in summary, the present study indicates that opioid agonists
that differentially regulate ␮or also selectively induce changes
in expression and abundance of a protein involved in ␮or
internalization/down-regulation. agonist-induced down-regulation may be mediated by an increase in dynamin-related activity that accelerates receptor down-regulation. in the future, it
would be of interest to examine the effect of directly regulating
dynamin activity on ␮or density and the functional potency of
opioids in the whole animal.
