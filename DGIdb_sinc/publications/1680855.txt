and pertussis toxin led to [32p]adp-ribosylation of three
proteins comigrating with the photolabeled and immunologically identified g-protein a-subunits (fig. 4c, see also fig. 8,
"experimental procedures"). the data show that the photolabeled proteins represent a-subunits of pertussis toxin-sensitive g-proteins andthat
pertussistoxintreatment
of
rinm5f cells (10 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 24 h) resulted in
a quantitative modification of gi and go a-subunits.
for identification of a2-adrenoceptor-activatedg-proteins
in rinm5f cells, we studied the effects of adrenaline and
clonidine on photolabeling of membrane proteins. the experiments were performed in the presence of gdp which increases the portion of photolabeling sensitive to receptor
agonists in other cell types (30,31). under this condition, the
proteins comigrating with the go a-subunits and the giz asubunit were photolabeled to comparable extents (fig. 5);
relatively little radioactivity was incorporated in the protein
comigrating with the gil a-subunit.adrenaline and clonidine
dose-dependently stimulated photolabeling of the proteins
comigrating with the two goa-subunits and the
gi2 a-subunit.
an effect on photolabeling of the protein comigrating with
the gil a-subunit was not detectable. the effects were observed at agonist concentrations 2 0 . 3 pm; maximal effects
. stimuwere observed at agonist concentrations >30 p ~ the
latory effects of adrenaline (fig. 6) and clonidine (not shown)
were largely reduced by the a2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, and abolished by the nonselective a-adrenoceptor
antagonist,  xxxd2914xxx .  xxxd3000xxx , an a,-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not affect agonist-stimulated photolabeling.
thus the effect of adrenaline on photolabeling involves a2adrenoceptors. in membranes of pertussis toxin-treated cells,
photolabeling of proteins was reduced indicating a reduced
basal activity of g-proteins (see also fig. 3). pertussis toxin
abolished the stimulatory effect of adrenaline (see fig. 6) and
clonidine (not shown) on photolabeling. the data indicate
that activated a,-adrenoceptors interact with two go a-subunits and thegiz a-subunit.
somatostatin and galanin also enhanced photolabeling of
g-protein a-subunits (data not shown). the effect of either
peptide employed at a concentrationof 1 p~ was considerably
less than that of adrenaline employed at maximally effective
concentrations. the effect of somatostatin (up to 1 p ~ was

may inhibit ca2+ currentsby acting on a signal-transductioncomponent distal of the receptor, e.g. the channel protein or
an unknown regulatory component. alternatively, galanin
receptors may additionally couple to g-proteins which are not
substrates for pertussis toxin. the present data indicate that
ca2+ current inhibition is a general feature of inhibitors of
insulin secretion. since somatostatinand galanin butnot
adrenaline have been shown to stimulate atp-dependent k+
channels (11, 12),the two peptides may inhibit insulin secretion by a more complex mechanism than does adrenaline.
during the course of our studies, adrenaline and somatostatininduced inhibitions of ca2+ currents in hit cells were reported (32, 33).
pertussistoxin-sensitiveinhibition of voltage-dependent
ca2+ currentsby receptor agonists including adrenaline, dopamine, y- xxxd2177xxx  (via gababreceptors), opioid
peptides,  xxxg1590xxx , and acetylcholine (via muscarinic
receptors) has been observed in a variety of neuronal cells
(16, 17). recent data indicate that the inhibitory modulation
of neuronal ca'+ currents maybe causally related to the
inhibition of neurosecretion via presynaptic receptors (18). in
pituitary cells, the pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitionof voltage-dependent ca'+ currents (21, 34, 35) may representa
mechanism by which somatostatin and acetylcholine inhibit
hormone secretion. by analogy, the inhibition of ca'+ currents
by adrenaline, somatostatin, and galanin in insulin-secreting
cells may represent a mechanism for the inhibitory control of
insulin secretion. since adrenaline, somatostatin, andgalanin
maintain their ability to inhibit insulin secretion in permeabilized cells in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner (13-15),
other mechanisms which are independent of transmembranous ion fluxes and the cytosolic ca2+concentration are likely
to exist.

rinm5f cells was sensitive to dihydropyridines. the dihy)

.
discrepancy in the sensitivity of rinm5f cell ca2+
currents towards dihydropyridines is possibly due to the difference in potency of the two compounds and to thefact that
findlay and dunne used a lower stimulation frequency (0.2
hz) than we did (0.5 hz). since adrenaline inhibited ca'+
currents by 50%, thehormone-sensitive currents represent at
least in part currents throughdihydropyridine-sensitive ca2+
channels. adrenaline apparently reduced the initial rate of
currentinactivation;therefore, an inhibitory effect of the
hormone on a fast inactivating currentcomponent cannot be
excluded. in hit cells, adrenaline reduces rapidly and slowly
decaying ca2+ currents, both of which are sensitive to the
