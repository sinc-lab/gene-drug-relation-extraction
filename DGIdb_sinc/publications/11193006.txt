summary
1 the objective of the study was to determine the role of muscarinic receptor subtypes in
mediating contraction of the porcine detrusor smooth muscle in vitro.
2 strips of pig detrusor muscle were set up in physiological salt solution and the tensions
developed by the tissues were recorded. responses to carbachol were obtained in the
absence and presence of a range of muscarinic antagonists (4-damp, methoctramine,
 xxxd1813xxx , oxybutynin,  xxxd3398xxx  and  xxxd2965xxx ). antagonist affinity values (pkb
values) were calculated and compared with those quoted in the literature for these
antagonists at each of the muscarinic receptor subtypes.
3 the m3-selective antagonists, 4-damp and  xxxd1813xxx  had high affinities (pkb values
of 9.4 and 8.6, respectively). oxybutynin,  xxxd3398xxx  and  xxxd2965xxx  had affinities of 8.2,
8.1 and 6.8, respectively, whilst the m2-selective agent methoctramine had a relatively low
affinity (pkb =6.1). the rank order of affinities was, therefore, 4-damp\  xxxd1813xxx \
oxybutynin \  xxxd3398xxx  \  xxxd2965xxx  \ methoctramine for the pig detrusor. correlation of
the antagonist affinities obtained on the bladder with those published for these antagonists
at the five muscarinic receptor subtypes identified the m3(m3)-receptor as the muscarinic
subtype mediating detrusor contractile responses in vitro.
4 these data suggest that a small population of m3-muscarinic receptors must mediate
direct contractile responses of the pig detrusor muscle to muscarinic receptor stimulation in
vitro.

the bladder receives a dense parasympathetic innervation, acetylcholine acting on postjunctional
muscarinic receptors to induce contraction and
mediate bladder emptying. at least five subtypes
of muscarinic receptor have been identified using
molecular biological, radioligand binding and
functional studies (dorje, lambrecht, tacke,
mulschler & brann, 1991; richards, 1991;  xxxd1704xxx ,
reddy, watson & challis, 1994). which muscarinic receptor subtypes are present in the bladder is a matter of debate (in line with iuphar
recommendations lower case letters will be used to
signify cloned receptors and upper case letters the
native receptors (caulfield & birdsall, 1998). at
the mrna level, in situ hybridization and rt –
pcr studies suggest the absence of the m1, m4
and m5 subtypes in the human bladder, but have
identified the presence of mrna encoding the m2

and m3 subtypes, with equal quantities of each
(yamaguchi et al., 1996). the presence of both
these subtypes has been confirmed at the protein
level, where immunoprecipitation studies have
identified these receptors in the detrusor muscle of
several species including man (wang, luthin &
ruggieri, 1995; baselli, brandes, luthin & ruggieri, 1999). however, in several species (guineapig, rabbit and human) the m2-receptor subtype
predominates, the m2:m3 ratio being 3:1 in these
species and as high as 9:1 in the rat. surprisingly,
it is the minority population of m3-receptors that
appears to mediate contractile responses in vitro,
even in the rat (longhurst, leggett & briscoe,
1995) where they make up only 10% of the
muscarinic receptor population (wang et al.,
1995).
the pig is an often used and important model
for studying the physiology and pathophysiology
of the bladder and is thought to closely represent

the human situation. however, a recent radioligand binding study using pig bladder failed to
identify any m3 muscarinic receptors in the pig
bladder; competition experiments identifying a
single, homogeneous population of m2-receptors
(goepel, gronewald, krege & michel, 1998). because in all species so far examined the contractile
responses to muscarinic agonists in vitro are mediated via the m3-receptor subtype, we have investigated the role of muscarinic receptor subtypes in
mediating contraction of isolated detrusor muscle
strips from the pig.

statistical analysis
increases in developed tension to carbachol were
plotted as a percentage of the maximum increase
for each concentration – response curve. individual
ec50 values (molar concentration producing halfmaximal response) were determined from the concentration – response curves by use of the software
graphpad ‘prizm’ and mean −log ec50 (pec50)
values with sem calculated.
dissociation constants (pkb) for antagonists
were determined from the equation:
pkb = log(cr− 1)− log[b]

tissue set up

female pig urinary bladder was collected from
the abattoir and immediately placed in cold
krebs-bicarbonate solution (composition in mm:
nacl 118.4, nahco3 24.9, kcl 4.7, cacl2 1.9,
 xxxd2534xxx  1.15, kh2po4 1.15, glucose 11.7) at
4 °c. strips of tissue (10 ×3 mm) were cut from
the bladder dome, and the urothelium and serosa
removed. the tissues were mounted in 30 ml
organ baths containing krebs-bicarbonate solution which was maintained at 37 °c and gassed
with 95% o2 and 5% co2. the tissues were
allowed to equilibrate for 60 min, during which
time they were washed every 10 min and the
resting tensions adjusted to 1 g. isometric tensions generated by the tissues were measured
from uf1 force transducers to a computerized
data acquisition system via a cambridge electronic design (ced) interface using ‘chart’
software.
following the equilibration period, cumulative
concentration–response curves to carbachol were
obtained. tissues were washed for 45 min until
baseline-resting tension returned and were then
equilibrated for 30 min with krebs-bicarbonate
solution containing the appropriate concentration
of antagonist or vehicle (time control). following
30-min incubation with the antagonist, a second
concentration–response curve to carbachol was
constructed in the continued presence of the antagonist or vehicle. four concentration – response
curves were obtained with carbachol on each tissue, washing between each; one control curve
and three curves in the presence of different concentrations of  xxxd2965xxx  (3 – 30 mm), 4damp (3–30 nm), oxybutynin (30 – 300 nm),
 xxxd3398xxx  (30–300 nm),  xxxd1813xxx  (3 – 30 nm)
and methoctramine (1–10 mm). control experiments were also performed, where no antagonist was added and these were used to correct
for any time-dependent changes in tissue sensitivity occurring during the course of the experiments.

where cr is the concentration-ratio (ratio of the
ec50 values in the presence and absence of the
antagonist) obtained with a concentration [b] of
antagonist. schild plots were also constructed and
pa2 values determined from the intercept on the
abscissa (arunlakshana & schild, 1959). data are
presented as the mean with sem for pkb values,
pec50 values and maximal responses.
differences between mean maximum responses
for control curves and those in the presence of the
highest concentration of antagonist were compared using the student’s t-test (two-tailed).

drugs and solutions
 xxxd1813xxx  was a gift from pfizer (sandwich, uk).
oxybutynin and  xxxd3398xxx  were a gift from yamanouchi europe b.v. (leiderdorp, the netherlands). carbamylcholine chloride (carbachol) and
 xxxd2965xxx  were obtained from sigma (poole,
dorset, uk). 4-damp hydrochloride and methoctramine were obtained from research biochemicals inc. (natick, ma, usa). all solutions were
freshly prepared in distilled water and dilutions
made in krebs bicarbonate solution.

results
carbachol produced concentration-dependent
contraction of the pig detrusor muscle. the pec50
and maximum responses were 5.86 9 0.02 and
16.092.02 g, respectively (n=12).

effects of muscarinic antagonists
4-damp and methoctramine produced parallel,
rightward displacement of the concentration–response curves to carbachol without affecting maximum responses (figs 1 and 2). schild plots were
close to unity confirming a competitive mode of
action. mean affinity (pkb) values of 9.3790.07
and 6.059 0.05 were obtained for 4-damp and
methoctramine respectively (table 1). however,

antagonists again appeared to act competitively
without affecting maximum responses and producing schild plots with slopes of unity (tables 1 and

correlation of drug affinities at detrusor and
cloned receptors
the mean affinity values obtained for the antagonists at the detrusor muscle were correlated with
those found in the literature for the five cloned
muscarinic receptor subtypes (fig. 4). the pig
detrusor receptor was found to correlate best with
the m3 and m5 subtypes with correlation coefficients
of 0.91 and 0.92. however, only the correlation plot
for the  xxxg449xxx  had a slope close to unity
(1.069 0.17), the plot for the m5-receptor being
considerably flatter (slope =0.7590.11). poor cor-

discussion
radioligand binding experiments suggest that the
population of m3-receptors in pig detrusor smooth
muscle must be very small compared with the
m2-receptor population (goepel et al., 1998). de-

spite this, the present study has shown that the
predominant, possibly only, muscarinic receptor
subtype mediating direct contraction of the pig
detrusor muscle in vitro is the m3-receptor subtype. the radioligand binding study used [3h]qnb to examine the muscarinic receptor subtypes
in the pig bladder. a number of subtype selective
agents were examined and appeared to bind to a
single population of muscarinic receptors, the potency order identifying the receptor as belonging
to the m2-receptor subtype (goepel et al., 1998).
in the present study, 4-damp, an antagonist with
a 30-fold selectivity for the m3-receptor subtype
compared with the m2-receptor subtype, had a
high affinity similar to that reported for this drug
at the cloned m3-receptor (dorje et al., 1991) and
the functional m3-receptors of the rat (hegde et
al., 1997). in contrast, methoctramine, a selective
m2-receptor antagonist, had a relatively low
affinity supporting the conclusion that an m3receptor mediates responses in the pig detrusor
muscle.
this conclusion was confirmed when correlation
plots were constructed for the antagonist affinities
at the bladder receptor and the five cloned muscarinic receptors. choppin,  xxxd1704xxx  & hegde (1998)
also studied correlations between the bladder receptor in the rat and the cloned receptors and
found a reasonable correlation with both the
cloned m3 and m5 receptors. in the present study
poor correlations were obtained for the bladder
receptor against the m1, m2 and m4-receptor subtypes. although a good correlation was obtained
with the m5-receptor, the regression line did not
pass through the origin. the regression plot for
the m3-receptor, however, was the only one with a
good correlation and an intercept at the origin.
this supports the identity of the bladder receptor
as the m3(m3)-receptor subtype.
the schild plots for all the antagonists studied
had slopes which were similar to unity, indicating
that responses were mediated via a homogeneous
population of receptors. this suggests that the
large population of m2-receptors previously identified in this tissue is not involved in mediating
contractile responses of detrusor strips in vitro
under normal conditions.

the finding that this subtype does not mediate
contraction in vitro is consistent with findings
reported with normal bladder from other species
such as the rat and rabbit (longhurst et al., 1995;
mutoh, latifpour, saito & weiss, 1997). the
earlier report failing to find evidence of the presence of m3-receptors in the pig bladder using
radioligand binding (goepel et al., 1998) suggests
that the population may be very small. indeed in
the rat, the population of m3-receptors makes up
only 10% of the total muscarinic receptor population yet appears to fully account for the contractile
responses of the normal bladder in vitro
(longhurst et al., 1995).
the role of the large m2-receptor population in
the bladder, therefore, remains unclear. the lack

of a role for m2-receptors in the bladder may
change in disease and braverman, luthin & ruggieri (1998) have reported that following denervation of the rat bladder by removal of the pelvic
ganglia, m2-receptors appear to mediate direct
contractile responses of the detrusor muscle. the
function of detrusor m2-receptors may also be
enhanced following pharmacological manipulations which increase camp levels and it has been
suggested that the m2-receptor subtype may act to
reverse b-adrenoceptor mediated relaxation rather
than cause direct contraction (hegde et al., 1997).
in conclusion, the present data demonstrate that
direct contractile responses of the normal pig detrusor smooth muscle to muscarinic receptor stimulation in vitro are mediated via the m3-receptor
