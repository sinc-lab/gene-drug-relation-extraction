summary
phospholipase cb (plcb) isozymes represent a family
of molecules that link g protein-coupled receptors
(gpcrs) to an intracellular signaling network. here,
we investigated the function of plcb isozymes in sensory neurons by using mutant mice deficient for
specific plcb family members. expression analysis
indicated that plcb3, one of the four isoforms, is predominantly expressed in a subpopulation of c-fiber
nociceptors. a subset of these neurons expressed
the  xxxg1078xxx . ca2+ imaging studies revealed that plcb3 specifically mediates histamineinduced calcium responses through the histamine h1
receptor in cultured sensory neurons. in line with
this, we found that plcb32/2 mice showed significant
defects in scratching behavior induced by histamine;
histamine-trifluoromethyl-toluidine (htmt), a selective
h1 agonist; and compound 48/80, a mast cell activator.
these results demonstrate that plcb3 is required to
mediate ‘‘itch’’ sensation in response to histamine acting on the  xxxg1078xxx  in c-fiber nociceptive
neurons.
introduction
sensory neurons innervating the skin detect a variety of
stimuli, including touch, pain, pressure, temperature,
and chemicals. they report the presence of these stimuli
to the spinal cord, and subsequently to the brain. nociceptors represent a subpopulation of sensory neurons
that are activated by noxious stimuli. they can be
broadly divided into two classes: one group has smalldiameter cell bodies and slowly conducting, unmyelinated axons (known as c-fibers), whereas the other has
medium-diameter cell bodies and faster conducting,
lightly myelinated axons (known as ad fibers). in addition, c-fiber nociceptors can be subdivided on the basis
of histological markers or requirements for neurotropic
factors (molliver et al., 1997; nagy and hunt, 1982;
snider and mcmahon, 1998). although c-fiber nociceptive neurons are mainly involved in pain perception, it
has become evident that a specific subset of c-fibers
is specialized to report the sensation of ‘‘itch’’ (magerl
et al., 1990; rees and laidlaw, 1999; schmelz et al.,
1997). there is also evidence that a-fibers contribute
to the itch sensation (graham et al., 1951; handwerker
et al., 1987; magerl, 1991).
itch is defined as a sensation that evokes scratching
behavior. it can be elicited only in the skin, skin-to-

mucosal transitional surfaces, or certain mucosal surfaces such as the roof of the mouth. itching is reliably
induced by a variety of chemical stimuli, the best example of which is histamine acting on histamine receptors.
histamine or other possible pruritic mediators are
mainly released from cutaneous mast cells, which are
located close to sensory fibers in the skin (botchkarev
et al., 1997; hagforsen et al., 2000). histamine can excite
a subpopulation of polymodal c-fiber nociceptors
(handwerker et al., 1991). a subset of itch-selective cfibers has been identified that is insensitive to mechanical and heat stimuli, but responds to histamine with very
slow conduction velocities (schmelz et al., 1997). however, the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms
that transduce the histamine response in sensory fibers
are still obscure. molecular analysis has so far identified
four subtypes of histamine receptors, h1–h4 (bachert,
2002; haaksma et al., 1990; oda et al., 2000; zhu et al.,
2001). pharmacological experiments have suggested
that histamine-induced itching involves the h1, and possibly the h3 or h4, receptors (bell et al., 2004; hagermark et al., 1979). in guinea pig sensory neurons, histamine h1 receptors appear to be expressed in a subset of
isolectin b4+ (ib4+) neurons (kashiba et al., 1999). there
is also evidence that histamine h3 receptors are located
on peripheral endings of peptidergic nerve fibers in the
rat (ohkubo et al., 1995).
numerous g protein-coupled receptors (gpcrs) are
expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons. phospholipase cb (plcb) is one of the key players in the signaling
cascade that links gpcrs to an intracellular signaling
network. four major g protein-coupled plcb isoforms
have been characterized: plcb1, plcb2, plcb3, and
plcb4. gpcr-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (pip2) by plcb generates two
primary intracellular messengers, diacylglycerol (dag)
and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (ip3), which mediate the
activation of protein kinase c (pkc) and intracellular
ca2+ release, respectively (exton, 1996). moreover, several physiological and functional studies have shown
that plcb signaling is engaged in a diverse range of
sensory functions by specifically or selectively coupling
to gpcrs. for example, plcb4 is involved in mediating
inflammatory pain in the ventral posterolateral thalamic
nucleus (vpl) by coupling to metabotropic glutamate
receptor type 1 ( xxxg972xxx ) (miyata et al., 2003). previously,
plcb3-deficient mice were shown to have enhanced
morphine responsiveness (xie et al., 1999). plcb2 signaling is also required to mediate bitter, sweet, and
umami taste signal transduction (zhang et al., 2003).
however, despite indications of an important role for
plc-mediated pathways in sensory signal transduction,
there is only indirect evidence supporting their specific
functions in primary sensory neurons (xie et al., 1999).
in order to understand how this protein family with
multiple isoforms plays a role in sensory neurons, (1)
we determined the cell type-specific distribution and localization of plcb isoforms in sensory neurons. (2) we
then identified histamine as a plcb3-dependent agonist
by screening agonists using the dorsal root ganglia

neuron
692

(drg) neurons derived from mutant mice and their wildtype littermates. (3) finally, histamine receptor agonists
were intradermally (i.d.) injected into the rostral part of
the skin on the back of the mouse, and the itch response
was assessed by quantifying subsequent scratching in
wild-type and mutant mice. our data demonstrate that
plcb3 is required to mediate the itch signal generated
via  xxxg1078xxx  activation on peripheral cfiber nociceptive neurons.
results
distribution of  xxxg923xxx  family members and plcb
isoforms in adult mouse drg and spinal cord
all phospholipase cb family members (b1–b4) can be
activated by interaction with heterotrimeric g protein
a q ( xxxg923xxx ) family members ( xxxg923xxx ,  xxxg921xxx , ga14, and ga15)
and are thus functionally linked to a given set of gpcrs.
in order to understand how these protein families with
multiple isoforms are organized, the expression of
 xxxg923xxx /plcb mrnas was comparatively examined in adult
mouse drg and spinal cord by in situ hybridization
using digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes. this analysis revealed that three  xxxg923xxx  members ( xxxg923xxx ,  xxxg921xxx , and ga14)
(figures 1a–1d) and three plcbs (b1, b3, and b4) (figures 1i–1l) are expressed in drg neurons. in spinal
cord, two  xxxg923xxx  members ( xxxg923xxx  and  xxxg921xxx ) and, as previously reported (miyata et al., 2003), two plcb isoforms
(b1 and b4), are expressed (figures 1e–1h and 1m–
1p).  xxxg923xxx  and  xxxg921xxx  are expressed in every neuron of
the drg and spinal cord as shown (figures 1a–1b and
1e–1f). interestingly, ga14 is highly expressed in a subset of drg neurons (figure 1c) and is also expressed in
a few motor neurons in the ventral horn of the spinal cord
(figure 1g). ga15 expression was virtually absent in
both drg and spinal cord (figures 1d and 1h). similarly,
three plcb isoforms, plcb1, b3, and b4, are expressed
at different levels in subpopulations of the drg neurons
(figures 1i–1l). plcb2 mrna was not detected (figure 1j). amongst the three plcbs expressed in drg
neurons, plcb3 showed the highest expression (figure 1k), whereas no plcb3-positive signals were detected in the spinal cord (figure 1o). plcb4 mrna is
also expressed in a subset of drg neurons, but at
much lower levels compared with plcb3 (figure 1l).
however, plcb4 expression was broadly detected in
the spinal cord (figure 1p). faint signals of plcb1
mrna were detected in limited regions in both drg
and spinal cord (figures 1i and 1m).
plcb3 and plcb4 are expressed in largely
nonoverlapping subsets of sensory neurons
the expression of plcb1, plcb3, and plcb4 in subsets
of sensory neurons raises the question of whether these
molecules are expressed in distinct or overlapping subsets. we applied double-labeled in situ hybridization
with combined probes of plcb3 and plcb4 using digoxigenin and fluorescein riboprobes. these double in
situ probes were hybridized in parallel on drg or trigeminal ganglia (tg) sections derived from wild-type,
plcb32/2, or plcb42/2 mice. these experiments indicated that plcb3 and plcb4 are primarily expressed
in nonoverlapping subsets of both adult drg (figures
2a–2c) and tg neurons (figures 2d–2f). only 10%

(28/284) of neurons expressed both isoforms. on the
other hand, plcb3 or plcb4 mrna were not found in
plcb32/2 tg or plcb42/2 drg (figures 2g–2i and
2j–2l), confirming the specificity of the probes. the
plcb1 probe gave insufficiently strong signals to be
used in such double-labeling experiments.
plcb3 expression is restricted to c-fibers, whereas
plcb4 is mainly expressed in a-fibers
since drg contains diverse subpopulations of primary
sensory neurons, we next determined whether plcb3
and plcb4 are expressed in more restricted subsets
of these neurons. nociceptive sensory neurons can be
divided into three main populations based on conduction velocity (nonpeptidergic c-fiber, peptidergic cfiber, and ad fiber nociceptors). nonpeptidergic c-fiber
nociceptors can be identified by binding of griffonia
simplicifolia isolectin b4 on the cell surface. in the
mouse, combined fluorescent labeling for isolectin b4
with in situ hybridization with the plcb3 probe indicated
that 83% (386/465) of the cells expressing plcb3 coincided with 85% (386/455) of ib4+ neurons (figures 3a–
3c). consistent with this result, double in situ analysis
indicated that plcb3 is coexpressed in 85% (495/582)
of the neurons expressing the purinergic receptor
p2x3, which is also primarily expressed in ib4+ neurons
(figures 3d–3f). furthermore, 70% (343/490) of plcb3+
neurons coincided with 100% (343/343) of the neurons
expressing the mrgd (mrgprd) receptor (figures 3g–3i),
which is known to be exclusively expressed in ib4+ neurons whose peripheral fibers innervate the epidermis in
the skin (zylka et al., 2003, 2005). since plcb3 is expressed in some non-ib4+ neurons, additional doublelabeling experiments with plcb3 versus calcitonin
gene-related peptide (cgrp) were carried out. we
found that 28% (113/401) of plcb3-expressing neurons
coincided with 34% (113/326) of cgrp+ neurons (figures 3j–3l). drg neurons can be classified into c-fiber
and a-fiber based on the degree of myelination. these
two subgroups can be distinguished by nf-200 immunoreactivity, which is considered a marker of myelinated
fibers (lawson and waddell, 1991). double immunolabeling using anti-plcb3 and anti-nf-200 showed that
plcb3 does not overlap with nf-200+ neurons (less
than 2%) (figures 3m–3o). therefore, these expression
data demonstrate that plcb3 is primarily expressed
in ib4+, mrgd+, and p2x3+ c-fiber nociceptors in the
mouse.
in contrast to plcb3, plcb4 was not expressed in
ib4+ neurons (figures 4a–4c), but rather in a subset of
cgrp+ neurons (figures 4d–4f). notably, most plcb4
was expressed in nf-200+ neurons (figures 4g–4i).
therefore, plcb4 is primarily expressed in myelinated
a-fibers, whereas expression of plcb3 is restricted to
neurons with histological markers indicating unmyelinated, c-fiber nociceptors.
plcb3 protein is localized both peripherally
and centrally
in situ analysis does not provide information as to the localization of the plcb3 protein. moreover, it is important
to know whether plcb3 can act peripherally and that
plcb3+ neurons project to a specific lamina layer known
to relay the information to the central nervous system.

expression is predominant in a subpopulation

spinal cord.

to determine the presence of the plcb3 protein in peripheral nerve fibers, we initially carried out immunostaining of plcb3 in the mouse skin, sciatic nerve fibers,
and drg culture. however, plcb3 immunoreactivity
was difficult to detect in peripheral nerve fibers, although anti-plcb3 antibody specifically detected
plcb3 protein in the soma area of the drg neurons
(see figure s1 in the supplemental data). to convince
ourselves that plcb3 is distributed to the peripheral
nerve fibers, we examined plcb3 transport in the rat,
which provides a better experimental model for this purpose. following double ligation of the sciatic nerve for
18 hr, a western blot was performed on nerve segments
(w3 mm) cut on various sites, including the proximal and
distal sides of the double ligature. the plcb3 rabbit
polyclonal antibody specifically identified plcb3 protein
at the expected molecular weight (w130 kda) in drg
lysates derived from wild-type mice (figure 5a: lane 1),
but did not detect plcb3 protein in the drg lysates of
the plcb3-deficient mice (figure 5a: lane 2). the bands
corresponding to plcb3 were present in each of the rat
sciatic nerve segments with much weaker intensity
compared with that of the drg lysates (figure 5a: lane
3–6), explaining why plcb3 immunostaining did work
well in drg soma but wasn’t observed in peripheral
nerve fibers. the blot was reprobed using an anti b-actin
monoclonal antibody to confirm that equal amounts of
plcb3 were present in each lane (figure 5a, bottom
panel). as shown, plcb3 significantly accumulated
only on the proximal side of the first ligature (figure 5a:
lane 4) compared with the other nerve segments, including the distal side of the second ligature. this eliminates
the possibility that the presence of plcb3 resulted from
sources extrinsic to the nerve cell and demonstrates
that plcb3 present in the adult rat sciatic nerve must

be transported anterogradely in peripheral axons from
the drg soma.
to ascertain whether plcb3 is expressed in central
nerve fibers projecting to the spinal cord, immunohistochemical staining was performed in perfused mouse
spinal cord sections. since plcb3 is not expressed in
spinal neurons, as shown in figure 1o, plcb3 immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn reflects the projection of
the central nerve fiber from drg neurons (figure 5b).
to define the laminar localization of plcb3, we stained
perfused spinal cord sections with alexa fluor-conjugated lectin ib4 and pkcg antibody (figure 5b). the former is a marker for lamina ii; the latter, for laminae iii and
lamina iii interneurons. double immunostaining experiments revealed that plcb3 immunoreactivity was localized in the superficial region of the dorsal horn that
includes the ib4+ laminae, and that it was dorsal to the
pkcg+ lamina (figure 5b). this result is consistent with
the finding that plcb3 is mainly expressed in ib4+ neurons and expressed in some peptidergic c-fiber drg
neurons. we further sought to determine if plcb3 is
present in the synaptic compartment of the mouse spinal
cord. spinal cord synaptosomes were prepared using
the methods described by guo et al. (2001). western
blot analysis of plcb3 clearly shows that plcb3 colocalizes with the synaptic vesicle marker  xxxg2236xxx , a 38
kda synaptic vesicle protein, indicating that plcb3 is
presynaptically localized at the central terminals of the
drg neurons (figure 5c).

plcb4-positive cells were counted as cells having a fluorescence
level greater than the background fluorescence resulting from identically processed sections derived from plcb42/2 mice. by alternating the light source or adjusting the contrast of confocal microscopy, we observed that the plcb4-positive signals were restricted
to the cell soma. in all panels, plcb3 is in red, and plcb4 in green.

we tested the possibility that they may be specifically
coupled to receptors in these different subsets of cells
and thus may mediate distinctive sensory signaling. in
order to test this hypothesis, we prepared acutely dissociated drg neurons derived from both adult mice that
were deleted for plcb3 or plcb4 and from their wildtype littermates and examined the effects of various agonists on [ca2+]i as a screen for the presence of plcb3
or plcb4-specific ligand effects. adenosine 50 -triphosphate (atp), uridine 50 -triphosphate (utp), capsaicin,
histamine, and bradykinin (bk) have been shown to elicit
[ca2+]i increases in dissociated drg neurons: atp is
a nonselective agonist that acts on the p2x and p2y receptors; capsaicin is a specific agonist for trpv1; bk is
a specific agonist for b1r and  xxxg258xxx ; histamine is a specific agonist for histamine receptors; and utp is a selective agonist for  xxxg1646xxx /p2y4 receptors (caterina et al.,
1997; nicolson et al., 2002; thayer et al., 1988; ueno
et al., 1999). application of atp (100 mm) or capsaicin

(10 mm) resulted in robust [ca2+]i release in the majority
of cells. compared with wild-type, plcb3 or plcb4deficient cells were not different with respect to the percentage of responsive cells (table 1) or the mean of peak
amplitude (mean f340/f380 ratio) when treated with
these two ligands (figure 6a). in wild-type cells, on average, 15% to w20% of the cells in the population responded to bk (1 mm), histamine (100 mm), or utp (100
mm). these three agonists are thought to induce increases in [ca2+]i through plc activation. nevertheless,
the percentage of neurons responding to bk or utp was
not different between cells derived from wild-type or
mutant mice (table 1), and no significant differences in
the mean f340/f380 ratio were observed between wildtype and mutant cells upon application of bk or utp
(kruskal-wallis anova analysis: p > 0.1) (figure 6a). in

of responding neurons showing calcium responses was
significantly decreased only in plcb3-deficient cells
(table 1). the mean f340/f380 ratio induced by histamine appeared to be at basal level (1.01 6 0.01, n = 40)
in plcb32/2 cells compared with wild-type (1.43 6
0.05, n = 23) and plcb42/2 cells (1.60 6 0.13, n = 15).
to further characterize the histamine-sensitive neurons, we examined the responses to 100 mm histamine
followed by a mixture of 1 mm bk and 100 mm utp. all histamine-sensitive neurons in wild-type and in plcb42/2
cells also responded to a mixture of bk and utp (figure 6b). a mixture of bk and utp elicited increases in
[ca2+]i in w30% of wild-type and mutant cells, which is
comparable to the combined percentage of neurons
responding when bk or utp were applied individually.
these results indicate that histamine-sensitive neurons
consist of two different subsets: bk-sensitive or utpsensitive cells.
next, we examined the activation and desensitization
kinetics in response to histamine. application of 100 mm
histamine to wild-type neurons elicited a rapid rise in
[ca2+]i, with peak responses achieved within 10–20 s.
the successive application of histamine led to a reduced
response compared with the peak height elicited by the
first application (figure 6c), indicating desensitization.
since histamine-induced calcium responses may
result from the activation of four isotypes, h1, h2, h3,
and h4, we tried to determine which receptor mediates
the histamine-induced increase in [ca2+]i. we used histamine receptor antagonists relatively specific for each
receptor isotype:  xxxd3050xxx  ( xxxg1078xxx  antagonist),

two places for 18 hr, after which the ligatures were removed and 3
mm segments homogenized. the tissue extracts were then subjected to a 4%–12% gradient sds-page, the protein was transferred onto nitrocellulose, and a western blot was performed using
anti-plcb3 antibody (1:800). after that, the blot was reprobed by
b-actin antibody (1:20,000), which was used as a control to compare
levels of protein loading in each lane. to show plcb3 antibody specificity, the same amounts of drg lysate derived from wild-type and
plcb3-deficient mice were loaded in lane 1 and 2, respectively, and
subjected to immunoblot analysis. each lane corresponds to the
drg segments illustrated.

antibody or anti- xxxg2236xxx  antibody (1:2000). note that plcb3
colocalizes with  xxxg2236xxx  in the spinal synaptosome preparation. similar results were obtained in at least three separate
experiments.

the fraction of responding neurons per total number of cells tested.

cimetidine ( xxxg1079xxx  antagonist), and thioperamide
(h3 receptor antagonist). as previously reported (nicolson et al., 2002), only the  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist,  xxxd3050xxx  (10 mm), abolished the histamine-induced calcium
responses in wild-type neurons. bk and utp responsiveness, however, were not changed in the presence
of  xxxd3050xxx  (figure 6d).
single in situ analysis revealed that the  xxxg1078xxx  is
expressed in 14.5% (58/399) of the sensory neurons,
and all of the h1-positive cells were observed to be
amongst the small-diameter neurons (figure 6e). moreover, double in situ analysis confirmed that 90% (26/29)
of the  xxxg1078xxx -expressing neurons coexpressed
with plcb3 (figure 6f). western blotting detected the
 xxxg1078xxx  in mouse whole drg, and the level of expression of  xxxg1078xxx  was not changed in
mutant mice (figure s2b), indicating that absence of
plcb3 or plcb4 did not effect the expression levels of
the  xxxg1078xxx  in the drg.
in order to identify the types of neurons that show
histamine responses, acutely dissociated mouse drg
neurons were labeled with ib4 before recording. in our
preparation, ib4-labeled cells on the average represented approximately 50% of the wild-type or mutant
drg neurons in culture. plcb3 immunoreactive cells
represented 70% (319/485) of the total neuron culture,
and most ib4+ neurons were plcb3+, which is consistent
with the results of the in situ analysis. in wild-type cells,
histamine evoked calcium responses in 23.4% (56/239)
of ib4+ and 7.2% (15/208) of the ib42 neurons. in plcb3deficient ib4+ cells, the responses were almost completely abolished (only 1% [1/103] cells responded),
while in plcb3-deficient ib42 neurons, 4.1% (4/97)
showed calcium responses. taken together, these results demonstrate that plcb3 is specifically coupled to
the  xxxg1078xxx  and mediates histamineinduced calcium responses in a sensory neuron population that consists almost entirely of ib4+ neurons.

the identification of histamine as a plcb3-specific agonist led to speculation that plcb3 might mediate itching
in vivo. pruritic compounds, including histamine, were
injected i.d. into the rostral part of the back skin of
wild-type, plcb3-, or plcb4-deficient mice, and itch
was assessed by quantifying the scratching. mice used
in the scratching behavioral assay were littermates or
age-matched, but not sex matched because in preliminary experiments we couldn’t find any significant sex
differences in scratching reactions to the tested drugs
(figure s3). in the case of plcb42/2 mice, we were not
able to determine the scratching responses since these

mice suffer from locomotor ataxia of their hindlimbs,
as previously reported (kano et al., 1998).
figures 7a–7d show the time course of scratching
bouts for 30 min at 5 min intervals after the injection of
each compound. typically, the first scratching was observed within 2 to w3 min following injection, and
peaked within 10 min in wild-type mice. comparison of
wild-type and plcb32/2 mice revealed significant differences in scratching initiation time (ti), peak, and total
bouts of scratching against compounds tested (figure 7).
when histamine was applied, plcb32/2 mice showed
delays in the first scratching response (wt: ti = 143 6
10 s, versus ko: ti = 227 6 19 s; p = 0.002), with a significant reduction in mean total bouts of scratching over
a period of 30 min (wt: 152 6 17, versus ko: 46 6 9;
p = 0.001), but with the same peak at 5 to w10 min as
in wild-type mice. when the selective  xxxg1078xxx  agonist htmt was applied, the effect of plcb3
deficiency was the most pronounced. the total mean incidence of scratching in wild-type mice was 117 6 22,
whereas in plcb3-deficient mice it was only 7 6 4 bouts
(mann-whitney test; p < 0.001), which is almost comparable to the response elicited by saline injection
(figure 7e). the total mean number of scratching bouts
elicited by saline over the 30 min was 5 6 2 bouts
(mean 6 sem., n = 6). in wild-type mice, injection of
clobenpropit, an h3 antagonist and h4 agonist, evoked
the highest total incidence of scratching (362 6 47) and
also showed the fastest response (ti = 83 6 8 s) among
the compounds tested. the most significant difference
was observed in scratching at peak time and first
scratching response (ko: ti = 272 6 65 s; p = 0.016), while
the incidences of scratching after 10 min were not significantly different between wild-type and plcb32/2 mice
(figure 7c). among the tested drugs, the response to
clobenpropit shown in plcb32/2 mice was the least
affected (figure 7e). compared with wild-type mice,
only a 45% decrease in the total number of scratching
bouts (wt: 362 6 47, versus ko: 196 6 52; p = 0.033)
was observed, suggesting that a plcb3-independent
mechanism exists in clobenpropit-induced scratching
responses.
itch in humans and rodents can be triggered by histamine release from skin mast cells upon mast cell degranulation. among mast cell degranulators, compound
48/80 has been reported as a potent mast cell histamine
releaser in both in vitro and in vivo studies (kuraishi et al.,
1995; nakayama et al., 2002). thus, we next examined
the potential role of plcb3 in compound 48/80-induced
scratching responses. when compound 48/80 was
injected, significant scratching was observed in wildtype mice, which peaked within 10 min and extended
for 30 min, whereas in plcb32/2 mice, the peak was
significantly delayed with significant reduction at all

were significantly decreased in plcb32/2 cells compared with wild-type and plcb42/2 cells (kruskal-wallis; for histamine, *p < 0.001, n = 40),
but for other agonists, there was no significant difference in increases of mean f340/f380 ratios between any two of these three genotypes
(kruskal-wallis; for atp, p = 0.57, n = 23; for bk, p = 0.15, n = 20; for capsaicin, p = 0.38, n = 40; and for utp, p = 0.10, n = 12). each point is

was decreased by 77% compared with wild-type mice
(wt: 198 6 33, versus ko: 47 6 13; p = 0.002) as shown
in figure 7e. these results suggest that plcb3 mediates
the itch sensation that results from mast cell activation
in vivo.
discussion
plcb isozymes represent one of the key families of
signaling molecules that link gpcrs to intracellular networks. although a large family of gpcrs is expressed in
primary sensory neurons, it is not clear what roles the
isozymes of a given plc family play in sensory neurons
in vivo, i.e., to what extent they determine the specificity
of individual signaling pathways. this study demonstrated a high degree of cellular and functional specificity
for different plc isoforms. we found that plcb3 is predominantly expressed in c-fiber nociceptive peripheral
nerves, that it is specifically coupled to the histamine
 xxxg1078xxx , and that it mediates histamine-induced
scratching (itch).

functional implications and distribution of plcb
isozymes in adult mouse drg neurons
plcb activity is regulated by a number of gpcrs linked
to the  xxxg923xxx  subfamily ( xxxg923xxx ,  xxxg921xxx , ga14, and ga15) of
heterotrimeric gtp binding proteins (g proteins). in
addition, two of the plcb isoforms (plcb2 and plcb3)
can be activated by the  xxxg433xxx  subunit dissociated from
gai/o subfamily in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner
(smrcka et al., 1991). plcb isoforms differ in their sensitivity to stimulation by  xxxg923xxx  subunits or  xxxg433xxx . these
biochemical properties may underscore potential plcb
isoform-specific differences in signaling.
in adult mouse drg, plcb3 is a major isoform with
lower levels of plcb4 and much lower levels of plcb1.
this is analogous to the expression pattern of plcb
isoforms observed in purkinje cells in the cerebellum
(kano et al., 1998), but it is essentially different from expression patterns in other brain regions, in which plcb1
and plcb4 represent the major neuronal plcb isoforms.
in contrast to plcb1 and plcb4, plcb3 is not
expressed in central nervous tissues (e.g., spinal cord,
thalamus, cortex, etc.) implicated in somatosensory

the role of plcb3 in nociceptive sensory neurons
699

circuits (kano et al., 1998; rubio et al., 1999; watanabe
et al., 1998).
our data revealed that plcb3 is highly expressed in
a subpopulation of the c-fiber nociceptors that includes
85% of the ib4+ neurons and 34% of the peptidergic neurons, whereas plcb4 is mainly expressed in a-fibers.
differential expression strongly suggested that plcb3
and plcb4 could play different roles in signaling. in support of this argument, plcb3+ and plcb4+ neurons in the
drg contain an array of different molecular components. some of these differentially expressed components include the mrgd receptor, ga14, and trpc3
(data not shown). currently, we are investigating whether
these molecules are directly coupled to plcb3 and what
roles they may play in sensory function.
c-fiber nociceptors send their central projections to
the superficial regions of the dorsal horn in the spinal
cord. peptidergic populations target lamina i of the
superficial dorsal horn, while the ib4+ population is
focused on lamina ii (hunt and mantyh, 2001). these
layers contain projection neurons that transmit various
kinds of sensory information, such as pain or itch, to
related brain regions, including the midbrain, thalamus,
and limbic regions (braz et al., 2005; wallengren, 2005).
as revealed by double immunostaining, plcb3 is localized to lamina i and ii dorsal to the pkcg+ layer in the
dorsal horn. furthermore, we showed that plcb3 is
colocalized with  xxxg2236xxx  at the synaptic vesicle
in central terminals, but not in the spinal neurons. therefore, our results indicate that plcb3 is located in both
peripheral nerve fibers and central presynaptic regions
and could play a number of roles in signal transduction
and transmission.
the signaling specificity of plcb isoforms
in the drg neurons
receptor-mediated, plc isoform-specific or -selective
signaling is often found in vivo. several genetic studies
have shown that plcb1 is involved in signaling in the
cerebral cortex and hippocampus by coupling predominantly to the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (kim
et al., 1997), whereas plcb4 works through the metabotropic  xxxg981xxx  in the cerebellum or thalamus
(kano et al., 1998; miyata et al., 2001, 2003), illustrating
that a specific combination of g proteins active in signaling from a given receptor can be involved in the selective
activation of plcb isozymes. such specificities can be
generated in several different ways. for example,
a conserved pdz binding motif at the c terminus of
a plcb isoform can interact with a given scaffolding protein and form a physically and functionally distinct signaling unit (reviewed in ranganathan and ross, 1997).
in addition, the signaling specificity of plcb isoforms
can be achieved through their unique distribution or
differential level of expression in a given tissue or cell
(kano et al., 1998; kim et al., 1997; miyata et al., 2003).
our data also suggest the possibility of plc isoformreceptor-specific signaling. as previously reported
(nicolson et al., 2002), we found that the application of
histamine evoked a calcium response in a fraction
(w16%) of drg neurons in culture by direct activation
of the  xxxg1078xxx . most histamine-sensitive
cells appear to be ib4+ neurons in which the plcb3
isoform is predominantly expressed. importantly, we

found that histamine-induced calcium responses were
significantly impaired in plcb3-deficient, but not plcb4deficient, drg neurons in culture. moreover, histaminesensitive cells appear to respond to either bk or utp. in
the majority of tissues, bk and utp have been reported
to induce plc activation through the  xxxg923xxx / xxxg921xxx  g protein
isoform. in the drg, the bk receptors, the b1r and  xxxg258xxx 
receptors, have been identified in nociceptive neurons
(ma et al., 2000; seabrook et al., 1997), and utp can excite
cutaneous c-fiber nociceptors through the g proteinmediated receptor  xxxg1646xxx  (molliver et al., 2002; stucky
et al., 2004). however, in neither plcb3- nor plcb4deficient cultured drg neurons was the calcium responsiveness elicited by bk or utp affected. only histamine
responses required the presence of plcb3, suggesting
that plcb3 specifically couples to the histamine h1
receptor in cultured drg neurons. these results raise
the question of how signaling specificity is achieved in
response to different agonists in the same cell. it is likely
that there are multiple intracellular pathways to induce
agonist-specific increases in [ca2+]i. however, the nature
of these pathways still remains unclear. one possibility is
that plcb1 may be responsible for calcium responses elicited by bk or utp since plcb1 mrna is weakly detected
in small-diameter neurons. in addition, we cannot rule out
the possibility that other novel plc isoforms such as plc3
or plch may play a role. these two plc isoforms were
also reported to be, in part, coupled to gpcrs through
the release of  xxxg433xxx  (wing et al., 2003; zhou et al., 2005).
in either event we are driven to postulate the formation
of isoform-specific circuitry in specifically differentiated
sensory neurons.
neural mechanisms of itch
with regard to the peripheral mechanisms of the itch
sensation, two distinct models have been proposed
(mcmahon and koltzenburg, 1992). the specificity theory proposes that a set of primary afferents exclusively
responds to pruritic stimuli. in contrast, the selectivity
hypothesis assumes that some afferents respond to
both pruritic and painful stimuli, whereas others respond
only to painful stimuli, and that the two classes have
different central connectivity. our calcium mobilization
assays revealed that at least four distinct subpopulations of chemoreceptor combinations could exist in
drg neurons in culture: bk+/histamine2, bk+/histamine+, utp+/histamine2 and utp+/histamine+. since
bk is mainly algogenic and not pruritogenic, the selectivity model is the more likely explanation for the sensation
of itch. unlike the case with bk, it is not clear yet whether
utp can act as an algogenic agent or pruritic agent in the
periphery. thus, it is possible that two different subsets
of histamine-sensitive neurons may have distinct functions in detecting the itch sensation. in support of this,
bk-induced firing patterns (kasai et al., 1998) appear to
be different from the pattern evoked by utp, which
showed a delayed (>1 min) and prolonged burst of action
potentials (>2 min), respectively, in nociceptive neurons
(molliver et al., 2002; schmelz et al., 2003). such electrophysiological properties coincide with the observation
that the itch sensation starts with a delay of 30 to w60
s following histamine application by iontophoresis,
reaching a maximum at 2 to w3 min (schmelz, 2001).
this suggests that the utp+/histamine+ neuron subset

neuron
700

might be more relevant for sensing histamine-evoked
pure itch, while bk+/histamine+ neurons may be responsible for grading or regulating the intensity of the itch
sensation.
plcb3 is a major mediator for sensation
of histamine-induced itch in vivo
since plcb3 is highly expressed in c-fiber nociceptive
sensory neurons, we initially reasoned that plcb3 might
have a role in nociception. however, mice lacking plcb3
showed normal behavior in various pain behavior tests,
such as the hot-plate test run at different noxious temperatures, von-frey, formalin, and tail immersion tests
(data not shown), precluding a specific role for plcb3
in transducing acute or inflammatory pain. in addition,
we also observed no difference in thermal preference behavior at the innocuous temperatures (data not shown).
in the skin, histamine is known to be a major mediator
that is released into dermis following mast cell degranulation. this event appears to be a primary trigger for the
itch sensation, which is mediated by c-fiber nociceptors
located in the uppermost skin layer (fjallbrant and iggo,
1961; schmelz et al., 1997; tuckett and wei, 1987). however, the signaling mechanisms underlying histamineinduced itch in the periphery are unclear. the present
study showed significantly impaired scratching reactions in plcb32/2 mice in response to i.d. injection
of histamine. this data appear to be very similar to
a scratching defect observed in plcb32/2 mice when
compound 48/80 was injected, which is consistent with
the fact that histamine is a major mediator released
from mast cells. based on our finding that histamineinduced calcium responses were mostly eliminated in
plcb3-deficient drg neurons in culture, it is likely that
the scratching response to exogenous histamine results
from direct action on sensory neurons expressing both
histamine receptors and plcb3. furthermore, plcb3deficient mice showed almost complete defects in
scratching responses evoked by htmt, a selective h1
receptor agonist, which agrees with the finding that histamine-induced calcium responses in drg neurons
were completely eliminated by pretreatment with  xxxd3050xxx , an h1 antagonist. in addition, previous behavioral
studies have shown that the  xxxg1078xxx  antagonist
 xxxd3050xxx  significantly reduced scratching when applied following the application of histamine or compound
48/80 (bell et al., 2004; hagermark et al., 1979; sugimoto
et al., 1998). therefore, we conclude that plcb3 mediates the itch sensation evoked by histamine released
from mast cells via the  xxxg1078xxx  on a subset
of peripheral c-fiber nociceptors, which are mainly ib4+
neurons.
on the other hand, one study reported that compound
48/80 can induce scratching behavior in mast celldeficient mice (inagaki et al., 2002). however, it is not
clear if a mast cell-independent pathway contributes
to scratching behavior under the normal physiological
condition.
since both the  xxxg1078xxx  and plcb3 are known to
be broadly expressed in peripheral tissues or cells, the
phenotype in plcb32/2 mice might conceivably result
from cells other than the primary sensory neuron. one
possibility, for example, is that the  xxxg1078xxx  in keratinocytes could be involved in mediating itch responses

via effects on cytokine production. however, this seems
highly improbable since the time course of histamine-induced cytokine production in keratinocytes has been
shown to occur in the order of an hour (matsubara
et al., 2005), while the scratching response is rapid and
occurs on a time scale of minutes. moreover, plcb3 is
not likely to be implicated in the neural circuit that
extends beyond the sensory cells since plcb3 is not
expressed in the spinal neurons or in higher brain areas
responsible for somatosensation. indeed, the scratching events appeared to be localized to the site of test
agent application. additionally, when compounds tested
were injected intraperitoneally, the resultant behaviors
such as grooming, mouse activity (bearing and locomotion), or some minor scratching were observed to be the
same in wild-type and plcb32/2 mice. these arguments
further support the idea that c-fiber nociceptors coexpressing both plcb3 and the  xxxg1078xxx  are primarily responsible for mediating the itch sensation at the
level of the skin.
beside histamine h1 receptors, h3 or h4 receptors
may be involved in scratching responses since a pharmacological study showed that the scratching response
in balbc mice was induced by application of clobenpropit, which is both an  xxxg1081xxx  agonist and an h3 receptor antagonist (bell et al., 2004). our study showed
that clobenpropit evoked an unusually high scratching
response in c57bl/6. the mean total number of bouts
of scratching was three times higher than scratching
induced by htmt. this may reflect differences in mouse
strains, which can markedly influence scratching responses to drugs (inagaki et al., 2001). although clobenpropit-induced scratching showed a reduction in
plcb32/2 mice, significant scratching responses still remained. this suggests that in clobenpropit-mediated
scratching there are at least two distinct mechanisms
that mediate the scratching behavior, and that they act
via plcb3-dependent and -independent pathways.
however, further studies are required to determine the
molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying clobenpropit-dependent scratching in vivo.
taken together, the available data are consistent with
the notion that the  xxxg1078xxx -plcb3-mediated pathway is a major component of the in vivo itch response
to histamine. this work clearly defines the signaling
events that generate the stereotypic ‘‘itch-scratch’’
behavior.

experimental procedures
animals
plcb3 (xie et al., 1999) and plcb4 (kano et al., 1998) knockout mice
were backcrossed seven and five generations, respectively, onto
a c57bl/6 background. animals were obtained by mating heterozygous animals. three-week-old wistar rats were used in sciatic nerve
ligation experiments. all experiments were conducted according to
protocols approved by the california institute of technology animal
care and use committee.

preparation and culture of mouse drg neuron
the dorsal root ganglia were isolated from adult mice (1 to w2 month
old) and cultures were prepared based on the method described
previously (chopra et al., 2000). for details, see supplemental
experimental procedures.

701

in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence
nonisotopic in situ hybridization on frozen 14 mm thick sections was
performed as previously described using crna probes (ma et al.,
1996; perez et al., 1999). for immunofluorescence, drgs were
collected from perfused mice and processed. four to eight confocal
images (w1 mm optical thickness) from adult wild-type mice were
counted to determine the percentage of plcb3-positive drg
neurons that coexpressed a given marker. we also checked by
counting the percentage of cells expressing a given marker that
coexpressed plcb3. details are available (see supplemental
experimental procedures).
ca2+ imaging
measurement of [ca2+]i at the individual cell level was performed as
previously described (dong et al., 2001; han et al., 2002). changes in
the intracellular ca2+ levels in acutely dissociated neurons derived
from wild-type or mutant adult mouse drg were monitored using
the ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2. for details of calcium imaging, see
supplemental experimental procedures.
synaptosome preparation
subcellular fractionation and isolation of synaptosomes from
c57bl/6 mice spinal cords were performed using a method described previously (keller et al., 1997). details are available (see supplemental experimental procedures).
sciatic nerve ligations
wistar rats (3 weeks old) were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal
injection of ketamine (44 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg). the sciatic
nerves were exposed and a double ligation was made by tying sutures around the nerve. after 18 hr the rats were killed by inhalation
of a rising level of co2. the nerves were dissected out, the thread
was removed, and 3 mm segments were cut on the four different
sites proximal and distal to the ligature and homogenized in cold
tx/g buffer (tbs with 1% tx-100, 10% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor cocktail tablet) with a probe sonicator for 10 s. homogenates
were spun at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 c, and the supernatant was
subjected to sds-page and immunoblot analysis.
scratching behavior
littermates or age-matched male or female mice of 2 to w4 months
of age, weighing 20–28 g, were used in the experiments. each mouse
was used for only one experiment. all animals were habituated to the
observation chamber for >2 hr before injections. as previously described (bell et al., 2004), the itch-inducing properties of histamine,
htmt, clobenpropit, and compound 48/80 were studied by administering the drugs i.d. into the rostral part of the back skin via a 23 g
needle in a volume of 100 ml. injection of saline solution was used as
a control. the dose of agonist was selected on the basis of its ability
to elicit scratching in each mouse studied, and with the aim of eliciting more than 50% of maximum scratching response. a bout of
scratching was defined as multiple scratch movements with hind
paws to the area around the injection site. the degree of scratching
was quantified as the total number of bouts as well as the cumulative
number of bouts (summed at 5 min intervals) over the 30 min observation period. experiments were carried out blind as to the genotype
of the animals or the nature of the drug.
statistical analysis
the data were expressed as the mean values with standard error.
kruskal-wallis anova was employed to compare [ca2+]i increase
as a response to tested agonists between any two of three groups
(wild-type, plcb32/2, and plcb42/2 drg neurons). in the case of
scratching behavior, statistical comparisons were performed using
student’s t test, mann-whitney’s u test at an unequal variance, or
kruskal-wallis anova. two-way anova with bonferroni correction
was employed to reveal a significant effect of genotype on time
course scratching behavior, as indicated. when the p value was
smaller than 0.05, the difference was considered to be significant.
