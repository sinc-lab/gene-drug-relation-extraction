mtor enzymatic activity, did not interfere with cox-2 inhibitor-induced stimulation of
hexose uptake in myotube. thus, mtor activation was not required for cox-2 inhibitordependent augmentation of hexose transport in myotubes. because  xxxg1839xxx  has also been
shown to activate mtor, we asked whether cox-2 inhibitors activate mtor by a prior
activation of  xxxg1839xxx . indeed, all three inhibitors induced tyrosine phosphorylation in  xxxg1839xxx 
and stimulated its kinase activity. moreover, pharmacological inhibition of  xxxg1839xxx  or the
expression of a dominant-negative form of  xxxg1839xxx  in myotubes completely abolished cox-2
inhibitor-dependent stimulation of hexose uptake. this study shows that selective cox-2
inhibitors activate a unique  xxxg1839xxx -dependent pathway to increase  xxxg2135xxx  abundance in the
plasma membrane of myotubes and augment the rate of hexose transport.

the rate of hexose transport in l6 myotubes in a dose- and
time-dependent manner by increasing the plasma membrane
abundance of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter-4
( xxxg2135xxx ) but not of the ubiquitously expressed  xxxg2133xxx  [1].
in contrast, cox-1 inhibitors (i.e., acetyl  xxxd3159xxx  and
indomethacin) had no effect on the hexose transport system
in l6 myotubes [1]. the translocation of  xxxg2135xxx  to the plasma
membrane of skeletal muscle usually occurs following the
activation of the  xxxg1194xxx -dependent transduction
pathway or through the 50 -amp-activated kinase (ampka)dependent pathway in contracting muscles [2]. we have
shown that the hexose transport stimulatory effect of these
inhibitors is slow (6-h lag period; maximal effect at 12 h),
insulin-independent and does not entail ampka activation [1].
in the present study, we addressed the hypothesis that cox-2
inhibitors increase the abundance of  xxxg2135xxx  in the plasma
membrane in myotubes by circumventing the initial step of
insulin transduction pathway and activating downstream
transducer proteins or by utilizing other unrelated mechanisms.
insulin-induced translocation of  xxxg2135xxx -containing vesicles to the plasma membrane of myotubes occurs upon the
binding of the hormone to its cell-surface receptor, induction
of  xxxg2198xxx  activity in its b-subunit and activation of a
downstream phosphorylation cascade that assembles and
activates regulatory complexes [2]. the initial step in this
cascade is the phosphorylation of certain tyrosine residues
in  xxxg1194xxx  substrates (irs) and the formation of
 xxxg1194xxx -irs docking complexes for various regulatory proteins with sh2 domain. both  xxxg1198xxx  and  xxxg1199xxx  are
expressed in l6 myotube. the former is considered the
predominant isoform that mediates  xxxg2135xxx  translocation to
the plasma membrane in skeletal muscles [2]. several
interactions that enhance the rate of  xxxg1198xxx  degradation slow
or terminate insulin action have been proposed: for instance,
glycogen synthase kinase-3 (gsk3a/b)-dependent phosphorylation of target serine residues in  xxxg1198xxx  directs it to
proteasomal degradation. the inactivation of gsk3a/b by
serine21- and serine9 phosphorylation, respectively, may
slow  xxxg1198xxx  degradation and extend the duration of insulin
action [3,4]. the role of  xxxg1199xxx  in regulating glucose transport
in l6 myotubes is ambiguous as silencing of  xxxg1198xxx  expression, but not of  xxxg1199xxx , reduced insulin-dependent  xxxg2135xxx 
translocation to the plasma membrane [5]. the insulin
receptor- xxxg1198xxx  complex activates  xxxg1743xxx -kinase, whose metabolite phosphatidylinositol (pi)-3,4,5-trisposphate then
recruits 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1
(pdk1). the latter activates protein kinase b (pkb/akt) by
targeted serine/threonine phosphorylations, allowing it
to phosphorylate other protein kinases and regulatory
proteins, which mediate a variety of cellular processes,
including the translocation of  xxxg2135xxx -containing vesicles to
the plasma membrane [2].
insulin-induced targeted tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg347xxx 
has been linked to an enhanced recruitment of glut-4containing vesicles to the plasma membrane in 3t3l1
adipocytes [6,7]. notwithstanding the dispute whether
this pathway functions in insulin-treated adipocytes [8], it
might contribute to  xxxg2135xxx  translocation in skeletal
muscles [9], possibly due to the expression of a novel skeletal

369

muscle-specific  xxxg347xxx  associated protein [10]. members of the
mapk family are also activated by insulin:  xxxg1370xxx /2 facilitate the
inactivation of  xxxg1198xxx  [11]. the intrinsic activity of  xxxg2135xxx 
might be regulated by p38-mapk [12].  xxxg1369xxx /2 have also been
linked to insulin signaling in skeletal muscles [13]. the active
pi3k-pkb/akt complex also activates mammalian target of
rapamycin (mtor), which regulates various downstream
pathways, such as augmentation of rate of translation of a
family of mrnas that encode components of the protein
synthesis machinery or ensues cap-dependent translation
initiation by activating p70s6k and  xxxg693xxx , respectively [14,15].
sampson and colleagues have recently identified a role for
 xxxg1839xxx  in insulin action in skeletal muscle cells: myotubes
overexpressing a kinase inactive, dominant negative  xxxg1839xxx 
became resistant to insulin-induced stimulation of glucose
uptake and  xxxg2135xxx  translocation, while overexpression of
 xxxg1839xxx  increased the rate of glucose uptake, even in the absence
of insulin [16].
we used  xxxd2723xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx  and rofecoxib that
represent early and newer generations of selective cox-2
inhibitors [1]. while there is no indication for a cox-2
inhibitor-induced activation of key elements in the classical
insulin transduction mechanism, this study shows that these
inhibitors stimulate the glucose transport system in myotubes
in a unique  xxxg1839xxx -dependent manner.

hexose uptake assay

the [3h]-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([3h]-dglc) uptake assay in l6
myotubes, in the absence or presence of insulin (100 nmol/l,
20 min) was performed as described [1,18]. cox-2 inhibitors
(dissolved in dmso) or other compounds (dissolved in ethanol
or dmso) were added to cell cultures from stocks solutions by
1000-dilution. dmso reduced the rate of hexose transport 3–
5%, while ethanol had no such effects.

2.4.

preparation of cell lysates and western blot analyses

myotube cultures were lysed for 30 min in an ice-cold lysis
buffer [in mmol/l: 50 tris–hcl, ph 7.5, 1 edta, 1 egta, 1
na3vo4, 50 naf, 10 sodium b-glycerophosphate, 5 sodium
pyrophosphate and 1 pmsf, and supplemented with 0.1% (v/v)
triton x-100, 0.1% (v/v) 2- xxxd26xxx  and protease
inhibitor cocktail (1:100 dilution)] and centrifuged (12,000 rpm
in an eppendorf centrifuge, 10 min at 4 8c). protein content in
the supernatant was determined according to bradford, using
bsa standard, dissolved in the same buffer. aliquots (5–60 mg
protein) were mixed with sample buffer [62.5 mmol/l tris–hcl,
ph 6.8, 2% (w/v) sds, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mmol/l dtt and
0.1% (w/v) bromophenol blue], heated at 95 8c for 5 min.
protein were separated by sds/page and western blot
analyses were performed, using commercial antibodies,
according to the antibody supplier’s protocol. total cell
content and plasma-membrane localised  xxxg2135xxx  were determined as described [1].

2.5.

immunoprecipitation

aliquots of cell lysates (1 mg protein) were mixed with 25 ml
protein a/g sepharosetm beads and incubated and rotated for
30 min at 4 8c. following centrifugation (12,000 rpm, in an
eppendorf centrifuge, 10 min at 4 8c), the supernatant was
added to 30 ml of fresh protein a/g sepharosetm beads
together with the proper antibody (2–4 mg) and left rotating
overnight at 4 8c. the pellet was then washed twice by
centrifugation in the lysis buffer. the bead pellet was
resuspended in 50 ml of ripa buffer [in mmol/l: 50 tris–hcl,
ph 7.4, 150 nacl, 1 edta and 1 pmsf, supplemented with 0.1
(w/v) sds, 1% (v/v) triton x-100, 1% (w/v) sodium  xxxd1835xxx 
and protease inhibitor cocktail], heated at 95 8c for 5 min and
used for sds-page and western blot analyses.

2.6.
recombinant adenovirus constructs and viral
infection of cultures
recombinant adenovirus vectors harboring the gene for bgalactosidase or kinase inactive, dominant negative mouse
 xxxg1839xxx  were constructed and used as described [19]. the latter
was generated by substitution of the lysine residue at the atp
binding site with alanine [20,21]. l6 myotube cultures were
rinsed and infected with a viral supernatant in fresh
complete amem and incubated for 1 h. the cultures were
then washed twice with amem and incubated in complete
culture medium for additional 24 h, followed by treatments
with cox-2 inhibitors and/or insulin. a staining kit for bgalactosidase in fixed cells (imgenex, san diego, ca) was used

according to the manufacturer’s protocol to determine
infection efficiency.

in brief, post-nuclear lysates of myotubes were prepared and
 xxxg1839xxx  was immunoprecipitated with an anti- xxxg1839xxx  antibody.
the kinase activity in the eluates was measured with the
singatect pkc assay kit (promega, madison, wi) according to
the manufacturer’s protocol, using pkca pseudosubstrate.

results

3.1.
cox-2 inhibitors augmented the rate of hexose uptake
and  xxxg2135xxx  abundance in the plasma membrane of l6
myotubes
the stimulatory effects of cox-2 inhibitors on the rate of
hexose uptake and  xxxg2135xxx  abundance in the plasma
membrane of l6 myotubes are summarised in fig. 1. exposure
of myotubes for 16 h to  xxxd2727xxx ,  xxxd2723xxx  and
rofecoxib augmented the rate of [3h]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (dglc)
uptake 2.6  0.15- 2.39  0.17- and 2.15  0.19-fold and
increased  xxxg2135xxx  content in the plasma membrane 2.01 
0.14-, 1.86  0.18- and 1.73  0.17-fold, respectively, in comparison with control myotubes. insulin (20 min) was less
potent than cox-2 inhibitors and increased the rate of dglc
uptake and  xxxg2135xxx  content in the plasma membrane 1.57 
0.10- and 1.45  0.07-fold, respectively. these results are
consistent with our previous data on the independent and
additive effects of these cox-2 inhibitors and insulin on the
hexose transport system in l6 myotubes [1]. total cell content
and plasma membrane abundance of the ubiquitous  xxxg2133xxx 
and glut-3 in l6 myotubes were not altered in the presence of
these inhibitors [1]. the optimal effective concentrations used
(200 mmol/l of  xxxd2727xxx  or  xxxd2723xxx  and 300 mmol/l of
rofecoxib) and the optimal length of the incubation period
(16 h) were determined before [1].

3.2.
cox-2 inhibitors failed to activate  xxxg1198xxx , pkb/akt or
pi3k, but induced  xxxg1199xxx  phosphorylation
we first asked whether cox-2 inhibitors could mimic insulin
action and recruit  xxxg2135xxx  to the plasma membrane of l6
myotubes by activating  xxxg1198xxx  or  xxxg1199xxx  in a non-insulindependent manner (fig. 2a). as expected, insulin rapidly
induced substantial tyrosine phosphorylation in  xxxg1198xxx , which
decayed within 20 min concomitant with a pronounced
serine307-phosphorylation. in contrast, no such tyrosine- or
serine phosphorylations in  xxxg1198xxx  were observed in niflumic
acid-,  xxxd2727xxx - and rofecoxib-treated myotubes. in addition, insulin-induced tyrosine- and serine-phosphorylations

fig. 1 – cox-2 inhibitors augment the rate of hexose
transport and  xxxg2135xxx  content in the plasma membrane of
l6 myotubes. confluent myotubes cultures that had been
maintained at 23.0 mmol/l glucose for 24 h were exposed
to 200 mmol/l of  xxxd2727xxx  (nim) or  xxxd2723xxx  (na) or
300 mmol/l of rofecoxib (r) for additional 16 h. some
cultures were treated with insulin (ins, 100 nmol/l) during
the last 20 min of incubation. the rates of dglc uptake
(open bars, n = 6) were measured and cell surface-localised
 xxxg2135xxx  (black bars, n = 3–4) was determined by the cell
surface biotinylation procedure, as described [1]. the basal
rate of dglc uptake (1.01 w 0.12 nmol/mg protein/min) and
the density of the  xxxg2135xxx  band of control myotubes,
incubated at 23.0 mmol/l glucose, were taken as 100%
values. mean w s.e.m., p < 0.05, *in comparison with each

the end of the last incubation period were reduced to 20
and 17 mm in culture media of control and cox2
inhibitors-treated cells, respectively.

of  xxxg1198xxx  were not altered in the presence of these inhibitors.
surprisingly, the three inhibitors mimicked insulin and
induced prominent tyrosine phosphorylation in  xxxg1199xxx 
(1.74  0.19-, 2.03  0.26-, 2.17  0.39-, and 2.07  0.42-fold

 xxxd2723xxx  and rofecoxib, respectively, in comparison with
control myotubes. means  s.e.m., n = 3). equally interesting,
an apparent mobility shift of  xxxg1199xxx , coupled with a distinct
reduction in its content, was apparent in cox-2 inhibitortreated myotubes.
the pi3k inhibitor  xxxd2523xxx  (60 mmol/l) was used to
determine whether active pi3k was required for cox-2
inhibitor-induced stimulation of hexose uptake (fig. 2b). as
expected,  xxxd2523xxx  blocked completely the stimulatory effect
of insulin. however, the hexose transport stimulatory effects
of cox-2 inhibitors remained unaltered and high in the
presence of  xxxd2523xxx  whether it was present throughout the
entire 16-h incubation period (fig. 2b) or when it was added at
4-, 8-, and 12 h within it (data not shown). fig. 2b also shows
that in myotubes treated with both cox-2 inhibitor and
insulin,  xxxd2523xxx  effectively abolished only the fraction of

fig. 2 – cox-2 inhibitors act in an  xxxg1198xxx -, pi3k- and pkb/
akt-independent manner, but induce tyrosine
phosphorylation in  xxxg1199xxx . l6 myotubes were treated with
 xxxd2727xxx  (n),  xxxd2723xxx  (na) or rofecoxib (r) and/or
insulin as described in the legend to fig. 1. cell lysates
were prepared, immunoprecipitated, separated by sdspage and used for the following western blot analyses. (a)
total  xxxg1198xxx  and  xxxg1199xxx  in cell lysates were detected with the
proper antibodies; py- xxxg1198xxx , py- xxxg1199xxx  and ps307- xxxg1198xxx 
were immunoblotted with an anti-py antibody (clone
4g10) or anti-ps307- xxxg1198xxx  antibody, respectively, following
immunoprecipitation with anti- xxxg1198xxx  or anti- xxxg1199xxx 
antibodies. the mr of  xxxg1198xxx  and  xxxg1199xxx  were 170–180 kda.
(b) l6 myotubes were treated as described above.
ly292,202 (60 mmol/l) was added 10 min before the
addition of cox-2 inhibitors or insulin. the rate dglc
uptake was measured at the end of incubation, and that
measured in control myotubes (1.12 w 0.09 nmol/
mg protein/min) was taken as 100%. mean w s.e.m., n = 3,
p < 0.05, in comparison with #insulin-treated myotubes or
*control and insulin-treated myotubes. (c) lysates of
myotubes, which had been treated with cox-2 inhibitors
and/or insulin, as described above, were separated by
sds-page and analyzed by western blotting for total pkb/
akt, ps473- and pt308-pkb/akt1, using specific antibodies.

insulin-dependent stimulation of hexose transport, leaving
the fraction induced by  xxxd2723xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx  or rofecoxib
intact.
treatment of l6 myotubes with insulin resulted also in the
phosphorylation of serine473 and threonine308 residues in pkb/
akt (fig. 2c). however, none of the cox-2 inhibitors induced a
similar pattern of phosphorylation in pkb/akt, nor did they
interfere with that induced by insulin. the total cell content of
pkb/akt remained unaltered in cox-2 inhibitor- and/or high
glucose treated myotubes.

3.3.
cox-2 inhibitors did not induce site-specific
phosphorylation in gsk3a/b,  xxxg1369xxx /2,  xxxg1370xxx /2, p38-mapk or
 xxxg347xxx 
pkb/akt-dependent phosphorylation of gsk3a/b attenuates
their capacity to phosphorylate serine residues in  xxxg1198xxx  and
target it to proteasomal degradation [3,4]. two observations
ruled out the assumption that cox-2 inhibitors augmented
the rate hexose transport in myotubes by inactivating gkk3a/
b, followed by a slower rate of degradation of  xxxg1198xxx . first, the
cellular content of  xxxg1198xxx  was not altered in cox-2 inhibitortreated myotubes (fig. 2a). second, unlike insulin, cox-2
inhibitors did not inactivate gkk3a/b by inducing serine21and serine9-phosphotylation, respectively (fig. 3a).
fig. 3b depicts a characteristic pattern of insulin-induced
phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine moieties in  xxxg1370xxx /2,
 xxxg1369xxx /2 and p38mapk. the capacity of insulin to induce
tyrosine774 phosphorylation in  xxxg347xxx  in myotubes is depicted
in fig. 3c. however,  xxxd2727xxx ,  xxxd2723xxx  and rofecoxib
failed to induce such specific patterns of phosphorylations nor

did they modify insulin-dependent phosphorylations of  xxxg1370xxx /
2,  xxxg1369xxx /2 and p38mapk (fig. 3b) or  xxxg347xxx  (fig. 3c).

3.4.

cox-2 inhibitors activate mtor in l6 myotubes

upon insulin stimulation, pkb/akt also activates mtor, which
subsequently mediates the phosphorylation of p70s6k and
 xxxg693xxx  [14,15]. a cox-2 inhibitor-dependent activation of
mtor seemed unlikely, because there was no indication that
the inhibitors promoted the assembly of a functional pi3kpkb/akt pathway (fig. 2). nevertheless, fig. 4a shows that
 xxxd2727xxx ,  xxxd2723xxx  and rofecoxib induced threonine389and threonine69-phosphorylation in p70s6k and  xxxg693xxx ,
respectively. these effects were mediated by mtor, since
the mtor inhibitor rapamycin abolished both insulin- and
cox-2 inhibitor-dependent phosphorylation of both target
proteins. strikingly, inhibition of mtor by rapamycin, which
attenuated insulin-dependent stimulation of hexose transport, left the cox-2 inhibitor-dependent stimulation of hexose
uptake in myotubes intact (fig. 4b). thus, the two effects of
selective cox-2 inhibitors in l6 myotubes – activation of
mtor, on one hand, and augmentation of hexose transport,
on the other – seem independent.

3.5.
 xxxg1839xxx  mediated cox-2 inhibitors-dependent
stimulation of hexose uptake in l6 myotubes
based on previous observations that  xxxg1839xxx  activates mtor in a
pi3k-independent manner [22–24] and our findings that cox-2
inhibitor-induced activation of mtor was not associated with
the hexose uptake stimulatory effect of the inhibitors, we

hypothesized that the primary effect of cox-2 inhibitors was
to promote the activation of  xxxg1839xxx . indeed, we found that cox2 inhibitors and insulin induced tyrosine phosphorylation of
 xxxg1839xxx  (fig. 5a and b). this was associated with an increased
catalytic activity of the enzyme: fig. 5c shows that  xxxd2727xxx ,
 xxxd2723xxx , rofecoxib and insulin increased 2.1  0.3-,
2.0  0.3- and 2.4  0.5- 1.4  0.1-fold, respectively, the kinase

phosphorylation of  xxxg1839xxx  (fig. 5a and b). concomitantly, it
reduced significantly insulin-,  xxxd2727xxx -,  xxxd2723xxx - and
rofecoxib-induced stimulation of the rate of hexose uptake in
myotubes (compare 1.19  0.07, 1.07  0.05, 1.36  0.08 and
1.29  0.11, respectively, in the presence of rottlerin, to
1.64  0.06, 3.15  0.08, 2.80  0.09, and 2.37  0.09 nmol
dglc/mg protein/min, respectively, in its absence. means  s.e.m., n = 3, p < 0.05 for each treatment in comparison
with its rottlerin-free control). fig. 5d confirms previous
studies [22–24] on a functional association between  xxxg1839xxx  and
mtor, as rottlerin prevented both insulin and cox-2
inhibitor-induced threonine phosphorylation in p70s6k and
 xxxg693xxx .
it should be noted, however, that rottlerin is also a potent
mitochondrial uncoupler that alters atp content in cells
[26,27]. mitochondrial dysfunction often operates a compensatory mechanism to augment the expression of  xxxg2133xxx  and
the rate of glucose transport in cells [28]. we found that a 12–
14 h exposure period of l6 myotubes to 5 mmol/l rottlerin
resulted in a 1.7-fold increase of  xxxg2133xxx  (but not  xxxg2135xxx )
content and a 1.4–1.6-fold increase in the rate of hexose
transport (data not shown). cellular atp content was also
measured [29]: while none of the three cox-2 inhibitors used
altered it significantly, rottlerin (5 mmol/l) increased it 1.75fold within 14 h, in comparison with control myotubes that
were similarly exposed to 23.0 mmol/l glucose. we speculate
that the rise in atp content reflects a stress reaction that
augmented the expression of  xxxg2133xxx , followed by a compensatory atp generation through the glycolytic pathway.
remarkably, no similar effects of rottlerin on  xxxg2133xxx  expression and atp content were observed when it was added to
myotube cultures together with  xxxd2723xxx ,  xxxd2727xxx  or
rofecoxib for the same period.
due to the complex effects of rottlerin, we sought an
alternative approach to elucidate the role  xxxg1839xxx  in mediating
the effects of cox-2 inhibitors on the glucose transport
system. myotube cultures were infected with recombinant
adenoviral constructs expressing kinase inactive (dominant
negative)  xxxg1839xxx  or (control) b-galactosidase. over 90% of
myotubes infected with the latter virus were stained positively
for b-galactosidase (data not shown). western blot analysis
(fig. 6, inset) with a polyclonal antibody against  xxxg1839xxx 
demonstrated a 3-fold higher content of the protein upon
the expression of the d/n- xxxg1839xxx  in myotubes, in comparison
with non-infected myotubes, or with myotubes expressing b–
galactosidase. the hexose uptake stimulatory effect of cox-2
inhibitors was measured in control and infected myotubes
(fig. 6): d/n- xxxg1839xxx  rendered cox-2 inhibitors inactive and
attenuated the effect of insulin. cox-2 inhibitor-treated
control myotubes, which expressed b-galactosidase,
increased the rate of hexose uptake to the same extent as
non-infected myotubes that were treated similarly.

discussion

this study shows that cox-2 inhibitors upregulate the rate of
hexose in l6 myotubes and that this effect is mediated by
activating  xxxg1839xxx . unlike the rapid insulin-induced translocation of  xxxg2135xxx  to the plasma membrane, maximal cox-2

inhibitors without or with insulin, as described in the legend to fig. 1. rottlerin (5 mmol/l) was added 30 min before the

inhibitor-induced recruitment of  xxxg2135xxx  to the plasma
membrane required 12–16 h [1]. we showed before [1] that
the combined effect of cox-2 inhibitors and insulin (added
during the last 20 min of the 16-h exposure period to the
inhibitors) on the rate of hexose transport was additive. the
present study shows that the mechanisms of action of the
inhibitors and insulin greatly differ: fig. 2b shows that
inhibition of pi3k abolished the effect of insulin, but left the
inhibitors-dependent stimulation intact, indicating that the
inhibitors did not assemble and utilize active regulatory
complexes of the insulin transduction pathway (i.e.,  xxxg1198xxx ,
pi3k and pkb/akt) to regulate the glucose transport system.
similarly, fig. 2(a and c) and fig. 3(a–c) show that gsk3a/b, ccbl,  xxxg1370xxx /2,  xxxg1369xxx /2 or p38-mapk, which are activated by
insulin, were not affected by any of the inhibitors. our
previous data [1] also rule out a cox-2-inhibitor dependent
activation of ampka. fig. 7 outlines the two independent
pathways by which insulin and cox-2 inhibitors affect the
subcellular distribution of  xxxg2135xxx  in myotubes.

several agents (i.e., growth factors,  xxxd2298xxx ,
cholinergic agonists) activate  xxxg1839xxx  by targeted phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues [30]. others have linked
insulin-dependent activation of  xxxg1839xxx  to the stimulation of
glucose uptake in skeletal muscles [31–33]. it has been
suggested that insulin-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation
of  xxxg1839xxx  is mediated by src [16] and that a rapid upregulation of
 xxxg1839xxx  expression occurs in insulin-treated skeletal muscle [34].
in contrast to these findings, other investigators have reported
that the activation of  xxxg1839xxx  attenuates or even inhibits the
 xxxg2198xxx  activity of  xxxg1194xxx  [35,36]. for
instance, greene et al. argue that active  xxxg1839xxx  inhibits
insulin-stimulated  xxxg1198xxx  tyrosine phosphorylation [37].
substrate specificity and subcellular compartmentalisation
of  xxxg1839xxx  are regulated by phosphorylation of distinct tyrosine
residues, which promote its co-association with divergent
binding/docking protein epitopes and substrates [38,39]. thus,
various pools of  xxxg1839xxx , localised to distinct subcellular compartments, may mediate different, and occasionally contrasting

functions in cells [39]. for example, tyrosine311 in  xxxg1839xxx  is a direct
target for src-dependent phosphorylation in rat cardiomyocytes [39]. it would be interesting to investigate whether the
 xxxg1194xxx -src- xxxg1839xxx  pathway in myotubes, described by
rosenzwig el al. [16], entails such tyrosine311 phosphorylation.
conversely, the phosphorylation of tyrosine332 may explain the
inhibitory effect of  xxxg1839xxx  reported by greene et al [37]: phosphotyrosine332 in  xxxg1839xxx  forms a docking site for the sh2 domain of
shc, which further recruits the sh2-domain-containing inositol
50 -phosphatase-1 (ship). the latter dephosphorylates  xxxg1743xxx ,4,5trisposphate and negatively regulates pkb/akt activation [39].
there are more examples of opposing effects of  xxxg1839xxx  in other
experimental systems: for instance, oxidative stress-induced
activation of  xxxg1839xxx  results in its translocation to mitochondria,
loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, release of
 xxxg569xxx  and apoptosis of transformed cells, whereas,
exposure of the same cells to fresh serum also activates of  xxxg1839xxx ,
but triggers antiapoptotic reactions [40]. the specific pattern of
cox-2 inhibitor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of  xxxg1839xxx  and
its subcellular localisation in relation to the upregulation of the
glucose transport system in l6 myotubes remains to be
investigated.
cox-2 inhibitors induced phosphorylation and reduced
content of  xxxg1199xxx , but not  xxxg1198xxx . the activation of  xxxg1198xxx  is
obligatory for insulin-dependent recruitment of  xxxg2135xxx  to the
plasma membrane of cells [2]. yet, the insulin-induced  xxxg1199xxx -

375

fig. 7 – insulin and coc-2 inhibitors augment the rate of
hexose transport in l6 myotubes by two independent
pathways. this models shows that cox-2 inhibitors
activate  xxxg1839xxx , which in turn increase the abundance of
 xxxg2135xxx  in the plasma membrane of myocytes. insulin
activates its specific receptor-mediated transduction
pathway, which recruits  xxxg2135xxx  containing vesicles to the
plasma membrane. in addition it may also activate  xxxg1839xxx 
that may contribute further to this interaction. the model
also stresses that an activation of mtor, either by insulin
or cox-2 inhibitors, is not required for the glucose
transport stimulatory effects of these agents.

 xxxg1194xxx  complex is not believed to contribute significantly to the translocation of  xxxg2135xxx -containing vesicles to
the plasma membrane. indeed, it has been proposed that irs-1and  xxxg1199xxx -signaling overlap incompletely and might play a
broader role than just mediating insulin effects, by functioning
also as proximal substrates for other signaling pathways
[5,41,42]. our data point to a cox-2 inhibitor-dependent
reduction of  xxxg1199xxx  protein following its hyper-phosphorylation.
this could result primarily from a  xxxg1839xxx -dependent activation of
mtor [22–24], because the latter induces  xxxg1199xxx  degradation
following the phosphorylation of selected serine residues [43–
45]. hitherto,  xxxg1199xxx  depletion has not been associated with
increased  xxxg2135xxx  abundance in the plasma membrane of
skeletal muscle cells [5]. yet, because  xxxg1199xxx  is the prominent
isoform in hepatocytes, pancreatic b-cells and kidney [5,46], it
would be interesting to investigate whether cox-2 inhibitorinduced hepato- and nephrotoxic effects as well as altered
b-cells function [47–49] are associated with such altered
expression and function of  xxxg1199xxx .
rottlerin exerted different effects in the absence or
presence of cox-2 inhibitors. in the former case, it augmented
the rate of hexose uptake and  xxxg2133xxx  (but not  xxxg2135xxx )
expression of the cells, possibly due to its mitochondrial
uncoupling activity. yet, rottlerin lacked such effects in the
latter case, where it blocked cox-2 inhibitor-induced increase
in the rate of hexose uptake. these findings suggest that the
mitochondrial uncoupling activity of rottlerin requires an
active cox-2 and possibly prostaglandin synthesis. interestingly, the stimulation of prostaglandin formation is listed

376

biochemical pharmacology 73 (2007) 368–377

among other  xxxg1839xxx -dependent effects in cells [50]. further
studies are needed to elucidate the impact of such putative
 xxxg1839xxx -cox-2 interaction in the cytoplasm or mitochondria on
energy metabolism and cellular functions.
 xxxg1839xxx -induced activation of mtor has been demonstrated
in several experimental systems [22–24,50], and associated
with induction of apoptosis, proliferation or differentiation, or
with regulation of other cellular functions [50,51]. this leads to
the hypothesis that cox-2 inhibitor-induced activation of
 xxxg1839xxx , followed by the activation mtor, may contribute to the
development and progression of adverse effects associated
with the use selective cox-2 inhibitors in man, such as the
recently reported severe cardiac complications [47–49,52,53].
finally, the molecular interactions by which cox-2 inhibitors activate  xxxg1839xxx  are not clear. we have shown before [1] that
some common prostaglandins fail to reverse cox-2 inhibitorinduced upregulation of glucose transport in l6 myotubes. this
may indicate that a direct inhibition of cox-2 is not required for
the hexose transport stimulatory effects of the inhibitors and
explain the lack of effects such effects of  xxxd234xxx  and
indomethacin [1]. interestingly, preliminary experiments indicate that cox-2 inhibitors-dependent activation of  xxxg1839xxx  entails
a 6-h lag period, which is similar to that observed in the timecourse analysis of the inhibitors’ effect on the rate of hexose
transport. this lag period may indicate that the primary effect(s)
of the inhibitors (either via direct inhibition of cox-2 or by other
unrelated interactions) lays upstream to  xxxg1839xxx  and precedes its
activation.
in summary, this study shows a key role for  xxxg1839xxx  in
mediating the hexose uptake stimulatory effects of selective
cox-2 inhibitors in l6 myotubes. this unique mechanism is
not related to the classical insulin-transduction pathway or to
the contraction-activated ampka pathway. the mechanism
by which cox-2 inhibitors induce site-specific phosphorylation(s) in  xxxg1839xxx , the nature of the molecular targets of activated
 xxxg1839xxx  and their effects on  xxxg2135xxx  subcellular distribution
remain to be elucidated. of a major interest is the hypothesis
that adverse effects known to be associated with the clinical
use of selective cox-2 inhibitors may result from the
activation of  xxxg1839xxx  and mtor.
